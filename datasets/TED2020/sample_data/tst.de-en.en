Now, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things. 
He's totally wrong about this one. 
It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits. 
It's actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film. 
It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music. 
It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news, which is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji. 
There's a coup government. There's a military government. 
There's crackdowns on the press. 
It's actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment. 
Here's what I think is going on. 
I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization. 
We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world. 
And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes. 
It includes things like the Internet cables. 
You can get on a flight in London, you can end up in Bangalore later today. 
Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji. 
It's all right there. 
When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks, you get a very different picture. 
You start looking at how the global plane flights move, and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat. 
It's extremely lumpy. 
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected. 
There's basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York. 
but look at this map, and you can watch this for, you know, two or three minutes. 
You won't see very many planes go from South America to Africa. 
And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off. 
So here's the problem that I've been interested in in the last decade or so. 
The world is, in fact, getting more global. 
It's getting more connected. 
More of problems are global in scale. 
More of our economics is global in scale. 
And our media is less global by the day. 
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent. 
And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world. 
Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk. 
Alisa's the president of Public Radio International. 
And she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month. 
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded. 
And that's basically what our media is about. 
It turns out that new media isn't necessarily helping us all that much. 
Here's a map made by Mark Graham who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute. 
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded. 
And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe. 
You probably won't. 
We look at the internet. 
We think we're getting this wide view of the globe. 
And we forget that most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores. 
This is a problem we have to solve. 
So here's the good news. 
For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys. 
This is a group called Global Voices. 
This is a team of bloggers from around the world. 
Our mission was to fix the world's media. 
We started in 2004. 
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far. 
Nor do I think we are by ourselves, actually going to solve the problem. 
The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention. 
In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA -- they're dark literally because of lack of electricity. 
And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country. 
They were doing something much simpler. 
It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet. 
but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup. 
Most independent media was shut down. 
Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing most people here don't speak Malagasy. 
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this. 
Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page. 
And while Google is very, very good with some languages, it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese. 
And the results can be pretty funny. 
And if you think this is absurd, it's not. 
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan. 
And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day. 
They look for the most interesting content in the English language. 
They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers, major websites. 
They put it online for free. 
Who's going after Chinese, which now has 400 million internet users out there? 
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. 
So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese, there's no guarantee that we're going to find it. 
When we look for information online, we basically have two strategies. 
We use a lot of search. 
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for. 
What are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it. 
The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock. 
You need a guide. 
So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices. 
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world. 
She has to know something about what stories are available. 
Basically, she's a deejay. 
I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process. 
I know Amira. 
I can ask her what to read. 
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read. 
And you can listen to her as well, if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened. 
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog, which is AfriGadget. 
And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context. 
And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi, who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel. 
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going, "Why would I conceivably care about this?" 
And the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you. 
This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference. 
He goes by the moniker White African. 
He's both a very well known American geek, but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya. 
He is a bridge figure. 
But the trick with bridges is, ultimately, you need someone to cross them. 
And that's where we start talking about xenophiles. 
Dhani Jones, who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals, has a slightly different approach to the off-season. 
Dhani has a television show. 
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe." 
And every week on this television show, Dhani travels to a different nation of the world. 
He finds a local sporting team. 
He trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them. 
And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing. 
For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food. 
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing. 
The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia. 
My challenge instead is this. 
It's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world. 
We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have. 
We have to fix our media. 
We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education. 
We have to fix our immigration policy. 
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles. 
That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help. 
I'm a storyteller. 
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story. 
I was born in Strasbourg, France to Turkish parents. 
Shortly after, my parents got separated, and I came to Turkey with my mom. 
From then on, I was raised as a single child by a single mother. 
Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara, that was a bit unusual. 
In fact, I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood. 
On the one hand was my mother, a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman. 
Many people visited my grandmother, people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands. 
Then one by one, she would encircle these thorns with dark ink. 
A week later, the patient would come back for a follow-up examination. 
I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying? 
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective, but also beware of the power of circles." 
It will dry up inside. 
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle. 
We all do. 
We're born into a certain family, nation, class. 
Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world. 
And it's happening everywhere, among liberals and conservatives, agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor, East and West alike. 
We tend to form clusters based on similarity, and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people. 
In my opinion, one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling. 
Stories cannot demolish frontiers, but they can punch holes in our mental walls. 
And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other, and sometimes even like what we see. 
I started writing fiction at the age of eight. 
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal. 
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried about my sanity. 
Instead, I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened. 
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction. 
And please bear with me: I'll draw a circle and come back to this point. 
Now one other thing happened around this same time. 
My mother became a diplomat. 
It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the "representative foreigner." 
In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities, yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian classroom democracy. 
The child who represented it was mocked, ridiculed and bullied endlessly. 
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. 
I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country: politics, cigarettes and the veil. 
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany and Ankara again. 
Everywhere I went, I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me. 
Stories gave me a sense of center, continuity and coherence, the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. 
In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul, the city I adore. 
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels. 
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999. 
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning, I saw something that stopped me in my tracks. 
There was the local grocer there -- a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals. 
He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks. 
But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us. 
Shortly after, I went to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan. 
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift, as a linguistic one. 
I started writing fiction in English. 
So I feel connected to each language in a different way. 
For me, like millions of other people around the world today, English is an acquired language. 
When you're a latecomer to a language, what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration. 
And that gap is very intimidating. 
But if we manage not to be frightened by it, it's also stimulating. 
And this is what I discovered in Boston -- that frustration was very stimulating. 
And because God loves her, I did get married. 
I guess one part of me has always been a nomad, physically and spiritually. 
Stories accompany me, keeping my pieces and memories together, like an existential glue. 
And this is a subject that I would love to think about together. 
When my first novel written in English came out in America, I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic. 
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently." 
And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him. 
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity. 
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one. 
Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily. 
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today. 
We're all thought to have something very distinctive, if not peculiar. 
When identity politics tries to put labels on us, it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger. 
There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together. 
I never forget my first multicultural reading, in Harvard Square about 10 years ago. 
We were three writers, one from the Philippines, one Turkish and one Indonesian -- like a joke, you know. 
It was only because of our passports. 
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary. 
A function is attributed to fiction. 
In this way, not only the writers themselves, but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. 
It comes from everywhere. 
My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted. 
Some people criticized, others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict. 
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction. 
It was just a story. 
And when I say, "just a story," I'm not trying to belittle my work. 
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is, not as a means to an end. 
Chekhov said, "The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things. 
And only the latter is an artist's responsibility." 
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects. 
One is interested in sweeping generalizations. 
The other, in nuances. 
One draws boundaries. 
The other recognizes no frontiers. 
Identity politics is made of solid bricks. 
Fiction is flowing water. 
In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah." 
They would go to coffee houses, where they would tell a story in front of an audience, often improvising. 
With each new person in the story, the meddah would change his voice, impersonating that character. 
Everybody could go and listen, you know -- ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims. 
Today, stories continue to transcend borders. 
Literature has to take us beyond. 
If it cannot take us there, it is not good literature. 
Books have saved the introverted, timid child that I was -- that I once was. 
But I'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them. 
The Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance." 
There's a metaphor which I love: living like a drawing compass. 
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place. 
Meanwhile, the other leg draws a wide circle, constantly moving. 
Like that, my fiction as well. 
In that sense, I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal, both from here and everywhere. 
In the palace, just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines, there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn. 
It's between buildings. 
I'm intrigued by this concept. 
We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things. 
But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most. 
When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability. 
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later. 
I like it when my characters surprise me. 
As long as it comes from our hearts, we can write about anything and everything. 
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift. 
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all. 
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel. 
We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next. 
In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes, drawing circles beyond circles. 
They connect all humanity, regardless of identity politics, and that is the good news. 
Thank you. 
Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome. 
Can that possibly be true? 
Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true? 
CA: How does it work? 
How do people release the documents? 
And how do you secure their privacy? 
This is something you leaked a few years ago. 
If we can have this document up ... 
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago. 
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened? 
JA: So this is the Kroll Report. 
This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004. 
Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years. 
He was a soft dictator of Kenya. 
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism. 
And so it came in from the outside. 
And that, after a couple of days, made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it. 
CA: Wow, so your leak really substantially changed the world? 
JA: Yep. 
The video itself is longer, but here's a short clip. 
This is -- this is intense material, I should warn you. 
Radio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up. 
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ... 
You're clear. All right. Firing. 
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot. 
Light 'em all up. 
C'mon, fire! 
Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six, we need to move, time now! 
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals. 
Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing. 
Roger. I got 'em. 
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile. 
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on? 
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em. 
CA: So, what was the impact of that? 
JA: The impact on the people who worked on it was severe. 
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story. 
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene. 
CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right, including two Reuters employees? 
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees, two young children were wounded. 
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together. 
CA: And releasing this caused widespread outrage. 
What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage, do you think? 
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. 
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full-time job. 
I mean, did he? 
JA: We have denied receiving those cables. 
He has been charged, about five days ago, with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50. 
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy. 
CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ... 
If you look at declassified cables, that's the sort of material that's there. 
CA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this. 
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy? 
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information? 
And there's a lot of information. 
And that's what we've found in practice, and that's what the history of journalism is. 
JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released. 
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy. 
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal -- personally identifying information in it. 
CA: So they are well-motivated. 
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying. 
That gives the impression, has given the impression, to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people. 
Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?" 
What would you say to that? 
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that. 
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception. 
That's what they see every day. 
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all, and that's our hope. 
Light is good. 
JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet. 
We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources. 
You know, there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian. 
You know, hero -- people's hero -- bringing this important light. 
Dangerous troublemaker. 
Who's got the hero view? 
Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view? 
JA: Oh, come on. There must be some. 
CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd. 
We have to try better. Let's show them another example. 
Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked, but I think for TED you are. 
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right? 
What is this? 
JA: So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day. 
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc. 
And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it, so it was an extremely difficult document for us. 
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about. 
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. 
So under that basis, we put it out and said, "Look, we're skeptical about this thing. 
We don't know, but what can we do? 
The material looks good, it feels right, but we just can't verify it." 
And we were like, "Oh, tell us more. 
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about? 
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document? 
Is it really yours?" 
So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID. 
Yeah. 
CA: Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP? 
JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment, we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort. 
That's a problem. 
CA: So that's the key bottleneck, basically journalistic volunteers and/or the funding of journalistic salaries? 
JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people. 
CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this. 
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools. 
Can that be right? 
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult, so the combination between the two ... 
JA: What, the movie business? 
JA: Well, I was a journalist. 
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. 
I wrote a magazine, was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager. 
So you have to be careful with hacker. 
I mean there's like -- there's a method that can be deployed for various things. 
Unfortunately, at the moment, it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts. 
So this phrase is not, not as nice as it used to be. 
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them? 
JA: I'm not sure about the incident. 
But the core values: well, capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims. 
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims? 
And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time. 
CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story: what happened in Iceland? 
Instead, they publicized your side. 
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next? 
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know. 
Iceland went through this financial crisis. 
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world. 
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy. 
Anyway, so we release this report in July last year. 
Iceland's a Nordic country, so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system. 
And just a month ago, this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously. 
CA: Wow. 
JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go. 
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see. 
In October 2010, the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99. 
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s, an unlikely reaction came out of North America. 
Consider this: like the prophets, all the superheroes are missing parents. 
Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one. 
Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman, loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City. 
Spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle. 
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel, get their message from above. 
And it's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked. 
This is the kind of thinking that went into creating The 99. 
Those are basic human values. 
And so the backstory of The 99 takes place in 1258, which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it. 
It's a story passed on generation after generation. 
But the Mongols get there first. 
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River. 
But in 1492, two important things happen. 
The first is the fall of Granada, the last Muslim enclave in Europe. 
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost. 
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia. 
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
And now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes from 99 different countries. 
After a while, his advisers complained. 
They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating. 
They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold." 
To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them." 
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge, is not new to my neck of the desert. 
The concept centers on something called the Noor stones. 
Noor is Arabic for light. 
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game: Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you. 
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay. 
Number two, all of The 99, when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it; they use it for self-interest. 
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them a mechanism that self-updates. 
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. 
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place. 
Some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today. 
I don't belong there. 
Now the main bad guy, Rughal, does not want these stones to update, so he's trying to get them to stop updating. 
He can't use the stones, but he can stop them. 
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this. 
So The 99 work in teams of three. 
Why three? A couple of reasons. 
I think that's there in all cultures, right? 
But this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing. 
And so this is the way I dealt with it. 
They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy, three boys, three girls, no problem. 
And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered. 
Well ... 
So here's some of the characters that we have. 
Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question. 
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power. 
Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer. 
I'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong? 
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ... 
Musawwira from Ghana, Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire. 
And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen. 
Al-Batina is the hidden. 
So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero. 
I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you." 
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots. 
And she said, "Show me." So I showed this. 
She said, "That's not me." 
I said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes." 
This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money. 
Next to him is Dan Panosian, one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men. 
Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man. 
Next to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman. 
And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes," back in 2005. 
Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference, and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist. 
Didn't have a product, but had energy. 
And I found somebody from The New York Times, and I cornered him, and I pitched him. 
I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year." 
He said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations." 
Like I care, right? 
"So when's the article coming out?" 
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon? 
That's not timely. 
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out." 
So a few days after that, what happens? 
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy. 
I became timely. 
And The 99 were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world. 
The bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue. 
In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before, there is a struggle. 
They don't know, OK, and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them. 
So there's a struggle within the team. 
So if we can get the lights ... 
["The 99"] Jabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold. 
I need more light. 
What's happening? 
Dana: There's too much darkness. 
Rughal: There must be something we can do. 
Man: I won't send any more commandos in until I know it's safe. 
Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos. 
Miklos: Must download file contents. 
I can't forget auntie. 
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you. 
Dana: But I can't help. 
Jabbar: You can, even if you don't believe in yourself right now. 
I believe in you. 
You are Noora the Light. 
Dana: No. 
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. 
Jabbar: Then what about the rest of us? 
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I? 
Now, tell me which way to go. 
Dana: That way. 
Alarm: Threat imminent. 
Jabbar: Aaaahhh! 
Miklos: Stay away from me. 
Jabbar: We're here to help you. 
Dr. Razem: Don't listen to them. 
Dana: Miklos, that man is not your friend. 
Miklos: No. He gave me access, and you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear]. 
["The 99"] Thank you. 
But that's only half the story. 
As the father of five sons, I worry about who they're going to be using as role models. 
I worry because all around me, even within my extended family, I see religion being manipulated. 
Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State. 
I left Bellevue, went to business school and started this. 
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts. 
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God, who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal. 
Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately, okay. 
And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place. 
The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate. 
The second one, they were actually split between Saudi and Afghanistan. 
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India, it was the party of a Hindu God. 
The second one took place in upstate New York. 
It was an Orthodox Jewish community. 
In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way. 
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism. 
But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us -- and this is dangerous. 
It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself as extreme. 
This is one of my sons, Rayan, who's a Scooby Doo addict. 
You can tell by the glasses there. 
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day. 
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house. 
I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy." 
I have work to do." 
You know, I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. 
And I think -- I think The 99 can and will achieve its mission. 
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something. 
And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel, ate it and, you know, talked and left. 
In a world like that, they'll always be a job for Superman and The 99. 
Thank you very much. 
So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. 
And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. 
But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. 
So I did a pretest when they came. 
And this means that it's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data. 
I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. 
And these were the results of the Swedish students. 
I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow. 
And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. 
I have shown that Swedish top students know, statistically, significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. 
They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. 
The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas. 
This country over here is China. 
This is India. 
"And what do you mean with 'Western world?'" I said. 
"Well, that's long life and small family. 
So this is what I could display here. 
I put fertility rate here -- number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. 
We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries. 
The error margin is narrow. 
Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries, up to about 70 years. 
And in 1962, there was really a group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. 
And these were the developing countries. 
Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. 
Are the students right? It's still two types of countries? 
Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? 
Or have they got longer lives and live up there? 
Let's see. We stopped the world then. 
This is all UN statistics that have been available. 
Here we go. Can you see there? 
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. 
Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. 
The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. 
This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. 
And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries. 
1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. 
And this is what happens. 
The data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. 
And the United States up there is getting longer life, keeping family size. 
And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. 
So let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of income. 
This is the world distribution of income of people. 
One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. 
There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. 
There's a little hump here. 
And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent of the world's annual income. 
And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. 
And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. 
And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. 
We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. 
But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income. 
We heard it in other forms. 
And who are these? 
Where are the different countries? 
I can show you Africa. 
This is Africa. 
Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty. 
This is OECD -- the rich countries, the country club of the UN. 
And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. 
And this is Latin America. 
It has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. 
And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia. 
And what did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? 
And most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. 
The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. 
And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. 
We'll have most people in the middle. 
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. 
We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. 
Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. 
In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. 
And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 
The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. 
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. 
Health is there and better health is up there. 
I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. 
And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble is the size of the population. 
Sierra Leone down there, Mauritius is up there. 
There's a huge difference [within] Africa. 
And Ghana is here in the middle. 
Here in Uganda, development aid. 
Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. 
There's tremendous variation within Africa, which we very often make that it's equal everything. 
I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. 
But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. 
I can split Arab states. How are they? 
Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference. 
Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used. 
Not as the myth is. 
And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. 
Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. 
There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. 
The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. 
East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. 
And there is Latin America. 
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. 
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD. 
And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. 
And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. 
This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China. 
And then he died. 
But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. 
I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. 
The label went away for me here. 
And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. 
I can run it forward, like this. 
And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower. 
And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. 
They came from here, a mineral country. 
They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. 
You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. 
You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. 
And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. 
In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. 
That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. 
So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. 
If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. 
These are the quintiles of Uganda. 
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. 
The poorest are down there. 
If I split South Africa, it's like this. 
The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss what solutions there should be in Africa. 
Everything in this world exists in Africa. 
We must be much more detailed. 
And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. 
Now, why doesn't this take place? 
Why are we not using the data we have? 
We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other nongovernmental organizations. 
Because the data is hidden down in the databases. 
And the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively. 
All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. 
It's not a new database that you need. 
We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here. 
So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. 
And it wasn't that difficult. 
You can take a data set and put it there. 
We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization. 
Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world. 
And what do we hear when we go around? 
Everyone says, "It's impossible. This can't be done. 
Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. 
But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? 
And we would like flowers to grow out on the net. 
One of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there. 
And I have pretty good news for you. 
I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible. 
He only says, "We can't do it." 
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. 
This is the income distribution of China, 1970. 
This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. 
Almost no overlap. 
Almost no overlap. 
And what has happened? 
What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it? 
We need really to see it. 
And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000. 
It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. 
I end now with the world. 
There, the internet is coming. 
The number of internet users are going up like this. 
And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. 
That's why the $100 computer will be so important. 
It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? 
Thank you very much. 
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky. 
The first one was actually a funeral -- to be more precise, a reburial. 
Now that was, ironically, and very befittingly, the way we found his grave. 
That match was unambiguous. 
The DNA matched, and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. 
What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds, about life on other planets? 
In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time. 
And at the time, people actually answered that question positively: "Yes." 
But there was no evidence. 
"What is life? What is the origin of life? 
Are we alone?" 
Now, the good news. 
A lot has happened in the last few years, and let's start with the planets. 
Let's start with the old Copernican question: Are there earths around other stars? 
It's a new telescope. 
The way we do that, actually, is with a method, which we call the transit method. 
It's actually mini-eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star. 
And as you see on this animation, what Kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star. 
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. 
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. 
But we learn a lot from that: not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size. 
How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. 
We learn about its orbit, the period of its orbit and so on. 
So, what have we learned? 
It basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size. 
There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay. 
So we count many, many such planets, and they have different sizes. 
We do that in our solar system. 
In fact, even back during the ancients, the Solar System in that sense would look on a diagram like this. 
Then the Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes, and of course three more planets were discovered. 
Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine. 
So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets. 
But up until, literally, 15 years ago, that was all we knew about planets. 
And that's what the frustration was. 
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. 
In the next 15 years, almost 500 planets were discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods. 
Unfortunately, as you can see, there was a very different picture. 
But you see, we haven't gone very far. 
We were still back where Copernicus was. 
We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there. 
And we didn't have the evidence for that. 
You can see here, the small planets dominate the picture. 
The planets which are marked "like Earth," [are] definitely more than any other planets that we see. 
And now for the first time, we can say that. 
There is a lot more work we need to do with this. 
Most of these are candidates. 
In the next few years we will confirm them. 
But the statistical result is loud and clear. 
And the statistical result is that planets like our own Earth are out there. 
Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. 
So the question is: what do we do next? 
Well, first of all, we can study them now that we know where they are. 
So, we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors. 
And the number, as you might expect, is pretty staggering. 
It's about 100 million such planets. 
That's great news. Why? 
We can find what they're made of, would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane. 
We know and expect that we'll see that. 
That's great, but that is not the whole news. 
That's not why I'm here. 
Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part. 
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next. 
So the question is: is that chemical phenomenon universal, or is it something which depends on the planet? 
We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. 
We don't need to go to space to answer that question. 
And so, that's what we are trying to do. 
And that's what many people now are trying to do. 
And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well. 
So this is one example that I want to show you here. 
So that's what we are building from the left side of the river. 
So why should you care about that? 
Why am I trying to sell you a half-built bridge? 
Am I that charming? 
Well, there are many reasons, and you heard some of them in the short talk today. 
This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. 
But there is something more profound here, something deeper. 
Now it's about something else, but it's equally profound. 
And the more we learn, the more that was reinforced. 
You've all learned that in school -- how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. 
And the bigger the telescope, the bigger that universe becomes. 
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot. 
This pixel is the Earth. 
It is the Earth as we know it. 
It is seen from, in this case, from outside the orbit of Saturn. 
But it's really tiny. 
We know that. 
Let's think of life as that entire planet because, in a sense, it is. 
The biosphere is the size of the Earth. 
Life on Earth is the size of the Earth. 
And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms. 
What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong? 
Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today? 
Let's actually try that. 
So in space, the Earth is very small. 
Can you imagine how small it is? 
Let me try it. 
Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be? 
It will be the size of a single, small atom. 
It is unimaginably small. 
We can't imagine it. 
But that's not the whole story, you see. 
The universe and life are both in space and time. 
If that was the age of the universe, then this is the age of life on Earth. 
Think about those oldest living things on Earth, but in a cosmic proportion. 
This is not insignificant. 
This is very significant. 
So life might be insignificant in size, but it is not insignificant in time. 
Life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent, parent and offspring. 
So what does this tell us? 
This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle, it's all wrong. 
And that potential, that powerful potential, is also our potential, of you and me. 
And the good news is we can actually, indeed do it. 
And let's do it. 
And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. 
Thank you very much. 
Up until now, our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms. 
We observe facial expressions, body language, and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another. 
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process. 
Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons, around 170,000 km of combined axon length. 
When these neurons interact, the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse, which can be measured. 
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses. 
Each individual's cortex is folded differently, very much like a fingerprint. 
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals. 
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves. 
Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process. 
And on top of that, these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. 
It doesn't require any scalp preparation, no conductive gel or paste. 
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle. 
It's also wireless, so it gives you the freedom to move around. 
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system, this headset only costs a few hundred dollars. 
Now on to the detection algorithms. 
Now, Evan is new to this system, so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him. 
He's obviously not Joanne -- so we'll "add user." 
Evan. Okay. 
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal. 
With neutral, there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do. 
He just hangs out. He's relaxed. 
And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain, because every brain is different. 
It takes eight seconds to do this, and now that that's done, we can choose a movement-based action. 
So Evan, choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind. 
Evan Grant: Let's do "pull." 
Tan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull." 
The first time, nothing will happen, because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull." 
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds. 
So: one, two, three, go. 
Okay. 
So once we accept this, the cube is live. 
So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling. 
Ah, good job! 
And this one is difficult because it's all about being able to visualize something that doesn't exist in our physical world. 
This is "disappear." 
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions, we do that all the time, so you can visualize it. 
Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go. 
Okay. Let's try that. 
Oh, my goodness. He's just too good. 
Let's try that again. 
EG: Losing concentration. 
As I said, it's a very difficult process to imagine this. 
Good job. Good job. 
So I'd like to show you a few examples, because there are many possible applications for this new interface. 
Obviously, you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind. 
The technology can also be applied to real world applications -- in this example, a smart home. 
You know, from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains. 
And of course, also to the lighting -- turning them on or off. 
And finally, to real life-changing applications, such as being able to control an electric wheelchair. 
In this example, facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands. 
Man: Now blink right to go right. 
Now blink left to turn back left. 
Now smile to go straight. 
TL: We really -- Thank you. 
So let me just start with my story. 
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college. 
Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee, and then developed an arthritic knee. 
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers, arthritis ruins more lives. 
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance you'll develop arthritis. 
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis. 
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain, until our joints quite literally grind to a halt. 
Let's consider an alternative path. 
What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature, or within our own stem cells? 
This is the field of biologic replacements, where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones. 
Kevin Stone: And so, the mission is: how do I treat these things biologically? 
I'm not ready for joint replacement." 
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [knee] joint space. 
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus]. 
And then for that unstable ligament, we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee. 
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients. 
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically. 
So with all this success, why isn't that good enough, you might ask. 
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles. 
There's not enough young, healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us. 
And the tissue's very expensive. 
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue. 
And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl, or gal epitope. 
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people, we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. 
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984. 
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue. 
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament? 
I can't grind it up in a blender. 
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique. 
What we do is humanize the tissue. 
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending. 
So what about the next step? 
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement, not just the parts? 
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement? 
Well here's how we're going to do it. 
So that's our biologic approach right now. 
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. 
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface. 
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom. 
There's a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation. 
We can harness those benefits. 
We can do it as an outpatient procedure. 
And so welcome to super biologics. 
It's not hardware. 
It's not software. 
It's bioware. 
It's version 2.0 of you. 
Thank you very much. 
Today, I'm going to take you around the world in 18 minutes. 
On my first day, I went to a restaurant, and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar. 
After a pause, the waiter said, "One does not put sugar in green tea." 
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom. 
But I really like my tea sweet." 
In response, he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation. 
"One does not put sugar in green tea." 
Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar. 
My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet, green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding. 
This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice. 
Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. 
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans. 
Unfortunately, these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries, in many cultures. 
At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders. 
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them. 
First assumption: if a choice affects you, then you should be the one to make it. 
This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for. 
It is essential for success. 
In America, the primary locus of choice is the individual. 
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns, regardless of what other people want or recommend. 
It's called "being true to yourself." 
But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice? 
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question. 
The first group came in, and they were greeted by Miss Smith, who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles. 
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed. 
It didn't matter who did the choosing, if the task was dictated by another, their performance suffered. 
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted. 
The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice. 
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences. 
Or, you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others. 
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships. 
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands. 
It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility. 
It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act. 
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this. 
The more choices you have, the more likely you are to make the best choice. 
You will surely find the perfect match. 
Let's test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe. 
One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question, but from a simple gesture of hospitality. 
During the very first session, which was run in Russia, one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard. 
"Oh, but it doesn't matter. 
It's all just soda. That's just one choice." 
You know, research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. 
Of course, you and I know that Coke is the better choice. 
But for Eastern Europeans, the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge. 
They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim. 
When asked, "What words and images do you associate with choice?" 
Grzegorz from Warsaw said, "Ah, for me it is fear. 
There are some dilemmas you see. 
I am used to no choice." 
Bohdan from Kiev said, in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace, "It is too much. 
We do not need everything that is there." 
A sociologist from the Warsaw Survey Agency explained, "The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them. 
They were never given a chance to learn how to react." 
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said, "I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum. 
I don't mean to say that I want no choice, but many of these choices are quite artificial." 
In reality, many choices are between things that are not that much different. 
The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options. 
Americans train their whole lives to play "spot the difference." 
They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability. 
Instead of making better choices, we become overwhelmed by choice, sometimes even afraid of it. 
Choice no longer offers opportunities, but imposes constraints. 
It's not a marker of liberation, but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae. 
Americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice. 
This brings me to the third, and perhaps most problematic, assumption: "You must never say no to choice." 
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S. 
and then hop across the pond to France. 
Right outside Chicago, a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell, were about to have their first baby. 
They'd already picked out a name for her, Barbara, after her grandmother. 
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant, she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. 
The baby was delivered through a C-section, but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia, a loss of oxygen to the brain. 
Unable to breathe on her own, she was put on a ventilator. 
What do they do? 
What do any parent do? 
In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali, American and French parents were interviewed. 
They had all suffered the same tragedy. 
In all cases, the life support was removed, and the infants had died. 
But there was a big difference. 
We wondered: does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one? 
We found that it did. 
Even up to a year later, American parents were more likely to express negative emotions, as compared to their French counterparts. 
He gave us a new perspective on life." 
American parents were more likely to say things like, "What if? What if?" 
Another parent complained, "I feel as if they purposefully tortured me. 
How did they get me to do that?" 
And another parent said, "I feel as if I've played a role in an execution." 
In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed. 
In her essay, "The White Album," Joan Didion writes, "We tell ourselves stories in order to live. 
We interpret what we see, select the most workable of the multiple choices. 
The story Americans tell, the story upon which the American dream depends, is the story of limitless choice. 
This narrative promises so much: freedom, happiness, success. 
It lays the world at your feet and says, "You can have anything, everything." 
It's a great story, and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it. 
But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way. 
No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere. 
Robert Frost once said that, "It is poetry that is lost in translation." 
And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism. 
Rather, it teaches us when and how to act. 
Thank you. 
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book. 
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind. 
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days. 
And I can't decide. 
And so one time I was in a beauty salon, and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink. 
And one was called "Ballet Slippers." 
And the other one was called "Adorable." 
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink." 
"Okay, great." 
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable." 
"What does it look like?" 
"It's a glamorous shade of pink." 
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart? 
What's different about them?" 
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous." 
Okay, we got that. 
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory, and I stripped the labels off. 
And I brought women into the laboratory, and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?" 
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick, of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles. 
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. 
And they are showing the signs of this. 
I'm sorry to have a sad slide like this, but not everything is all that happy, especially in my work. 
They are loaded with toxic chemicals in their body, hundreds of compounds, all kinds of compounds -- it's staggering. 
And they're dying off rather regularly, tens of thousands around the world. 
It's predicted they may go extinct -- about a third of them -- within about 30 years. 
So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic. 
It's called Seals as Sentinels. 
We're tracking pollution at the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish. 
It's a region-wide, eco-toxicological investigation. 
So we are tracking how do these things get from the products into the ocean, which is the final sink for them. 
They wind up in waste water treatment plants. 
As you all know, we throw out billions of computers and TVs every year. 
And those go to e-waste dumps. 
And all that gets into surface waters, eventually reaching the ocean, the final sink. 
So, in our study, we did find quite high levels, as we expected, of these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies. 
And we reported this. 
But we said, well, on the bright side, our harbor seals at least will not be bursting into flame anytime soon. 
Well, we detected 113 different compounds in my blood. 
But I was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason. 
Why? Because we are flame-retarding everything, and we have weak regulations for toxic chemicals. 
But lo and behold, I'm one of the high-end individuals. 
Lucky me. 
But then I thought, well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite. 
We're hardly regulating them at all. 
And we're letting industry run the show. 
Well, Big Chemical is what we're dealing with here. 
And they're allowed to keep trade secrets, so they don't even give the ingredients out. 
So it's a case of innocent until proven guilty. 
The burden of proof is not on the producer. 
So I then was invited to go to the Gulf in May. 
And we dove in the slick without even HazMat gear. 
And I did get sick. 
I got a ferocious sore throat two days later. 
I felt like my throat was on fire. 
But it did pass. 
And you could just see the web of death as you go down in the water column. 
Well, you know, we got into this in the beginning as a trade-off, they say, between the wetlands versus the ocean depth. 
And I didn't agree with that decision at the time; I still don't. 
The decision was to protect the marshes. 
When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out. 
And as you know, there's been a very weak response, up until recently, to actually collect the oil. 
It's gotten much more aggressive. 
This is an Exxon slide showing what happens, the scenario and the trade-off. 
So this shows oil on the surface. 
You can see it getting up into the mangrove, but it is not harming the corals or the sea grass, right. 
So here we have the other scenario. 
If you disperse, the sea grass and the corals are getting hit pretty hard, but you're saving the mangrove. 
So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay? 
Is it better with one or two? 
And then there's the problem of the plumes. 
What plumes? 
It turns out there are plumes. 
Independent researchers found that. 
And then there's the looming, messy problem of human health, reported human health effects. 
And actually, one of our federal officials said that it was probably heat stress. So ... 
Having been in that water just for the short time I was there, I can tell you, it is not heat stress. 
There are volumes of volatile petroleum fumes coming off that water, plus the Corexit, which has solvent in it. 
So it is not at all rational. 
So what do we have? The BP show is going on. 
Our officials complained about Corexit, which is the most toxic line of dispersants. 
Now they're on 9500. 
9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it that causes internal bleeding. 
We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way. 
So what we're doing, we're putting compounds with petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill. 
Does this make sense? 
So this is the way it works. 
And I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here. 
It's a micelle. 
Micelles form around the oil. 
And what happens first is the solvents break into the oil, the lipid membrane, they let the surfactants in there. 
The thing to remember about the micelles -- these little floating globules of toxin -- is they are there to deliver. 
They're like the FedEx guys. 
So from a toxicology perspective, this is really awful because Corexit and the dispersed oil are much more toxic together than either alone. 
And usually the exposure is a combined exposure. 
The dispersants -- as I was saying -- their job is to break down the lipid membrane. 
The solvents in them do that very efficiently. 
So they break down lipid membranes in our body, starting with cells of the skin, the cells of organs. 
So it actually hastens oil getting into the body easily and readily. 
Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds and other compounds that are toxic to every organ in the body. 
And so with the dispersants combined, you have this very synergistic combined toxicity. 
Corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds. 
So this is what we have to look at, these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets, which have nothing on them much. 
And now they were forced to release the ultimate list of everything that's in Corexit. 
And guess what, tons of stuff is missing. 
Derivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groups of many, many compounds, these sorbitans. 
And then you get down to the petroleum distillates, which are the solvents, hundreds of them. 
They are not identified. And why? 
Trade secrets again. 
BP's running the show, and the Nalco company, this is all they have to do. 
So we know from previous spills. 
And then part of this is just part of my bad dreams. 
And I appreciate being able to vent some of my anguish upon you. 
What we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard. 
And this is a study that was done on the Australian coast, the coast of Tasmania. 
Corals are, you know, the home to about a quarter of all marine species. 
And with the Corexit and the oil, there's zero percent fertilization. 
With oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization. 
So they're a very sensitive species to this combo. 
Here's another group. 
I could see myself easily in the water column. 
And we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture. 
See the oil and Corexit is causing death at a much, much lower dose than oil alone. 
That's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects. 
But my bad dreams go like this. 
The piscivorous fish, the cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish, also the tuna and sharks, are going to hit by this. 
And the gills are quite sensitive. 
The respiratory system is very sensitive. 
It also will cause internal bleeding upon ingestion. 
And what does happen with that eventually is pneumonia sets in and liver, kidney, brain damage. 
The Corexit is transporting the oil into every membrane and every system of the body. 
And you're having a lot of different unpleasant effects, but burns to the eyes and mouth, skin ulcers, lesions. 
We started hypothesizing: what do we know? 
what do with think would be a trophic cascade? 
which means that somebody gets wiped out, and then everything above that's eating those guys will crash. 
So our thought was -- this is a simple thinking process, but ... 
obviously the plankton, the planktivores, and that's about as far as we got. 
And then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out. 
They thought that eventually the killer whale would be at the top of this cascade. 
And then here's what really happened, much more complicated, much more specific. 
Actually the kelp and the barnacles that attach to the rock were decimated by the combination of Corexit and the oil. 
They were replaced by invasive species, which had less holding power to the rock. 
Storms came along. 
They ripped out of the rock. 
And this was the entire food web for the sea ducks. 
And as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks from the Exxon Valdez spill, and they haven't come back. 
So we are launching an independent study. 
But we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts, but we need lots and lots of partners to do this intelligently. 
We have some of the partners lined up. 
And Dave Gallo signed on. 
Sylvia's in here. 
And we hope that some of you will help us. 
My question to you is: why shouldn't we know? 
Don't we have the right to know? 
Surely we have the right to learn what loss we are going through in the Gulf. 
And my wish would be -- for the gulf prize -- would be that we have the truth. 
Whatever it is, please let us have the truth. 
And to get there, we need to do the assessment. 
So I appreciate being here. Thank you. 
For a moment, what I need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination. 
He arrives on the small hill, dripping with water. 
He stands there, and he looks across at the island, Sado. 
And he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky. 
Then he says to himself, very quietly, "[Turbulent the sea,] [Stretching across to Sado] [The Milky Way]." 
Basho was a brilliant man. 
He said more with less than any human that I have ever read or talked to. 
As he was nearing his death, his disciples and followers kept asking him, "What's the secret? 
How can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily?" 
And toward the end, he said, "If you would know the pine tree, go to the pine tree." 
That was it. 
If we would know the oceans, we must go to the oceans. 
I hope it will be. 
There are a few key points. 
One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth. 
Another is that there are bold, new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. 
So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system. 
They define what the system is. 
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay. 
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific. 
It's the whole planet, the entire planet, continents and oceans together. 
That's the system. 
The second one is internal energy. 
And these two war against one another almost continuously. 
Mountain ranges, plate tectonics, moves the continents around, forms ore deposits. 
Volcanoes erupt. 
That's the planet that we live on. 
It's immensely complex. 
This is a system that's been around a very long time. 
And these have all co-evolved. 
What do I mean by that? 
They interact with one another constantly. 
All of them interact with one another. 
We must understand it. 
Look at this complexity here. 
This is only one variable. 
That's our challenge, is to understand, understand this system in new and phenomenal ways. 
And there's an urgency to this. 
Part of the urgency comes from the fact that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving. 
All right, let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans. 
And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away from 1982 to 1998 and then cycling again. 
Another complexity: this is the age of the oceans. 
I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates. 
And I share with you some very high-definition video that we collected in real time. 
It's an astonishing insight, and we have only found out about this recently. 
This is very, very exciting. 
It may be the next rainforest, in terms of pharmaceuticals. 
We know little or nothing about it. 
And many of you remember the early stages of oceanography, when we had to use what we had at our fingertips. 
And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days. 
Some of you remember this, I'm sure. 
And now, we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful -- ships, satellites, moorings. 
But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need. 
Modeling: on the right hand side, there's a very complex computational model. 
On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring, which I'll show you in just a second. 
And on the basis of several points, the oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth. 
They are changing rapidly, but not predictably. 
And the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them. 
The computational power is amazing. 
But without data, those models will never ever be predicted. 
And that's what we really need. 
It's a new world. 
We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean, at will, communicating in real time. 
And this is what the system involves, a number of sites in the southern hemisphere, shown in those circles. 
And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites. 
It was once called Neptune. 
And let me show you what's behind it. 
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating. 
You can see the copper tips on these things. 
And this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second. 
This is phenomenal bandwidth. 
And this is what the planet looks like. 
We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like. 
This is what it looks like. 
And the cables go really continent to continent. 
It's a very powerful system, and most of our communications consist of it. 
Bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating. 
They will bring it and link it in. 
It'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope, except you'll have your own port. 
Climate change, ocean acidification, dissolved oxygen, carbon cycle, coastal upwelling, fishing dynamics -- the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume. 
And this is just the first of these. 
In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up. 
Now I want to take you into the caldera. 
On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount. 
And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. 
Here's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point. 
Very powerful. 
There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore, all available to anyone who has any interest in using it. 
We're flying across the caldera floor. 
There is a number of robotic systems. 
There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will, if those are your experiments. 
It's a full spectrum of tools. 
Now, that mound right there actually looks like this. 
This is what it actually looks like. 
Very, very powerful. 
And these are the things that we're funded to do today. 
So what can we actually do tomorrow? 
We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. 
Robotics systems are just incredible these days, absolutely incredible. 
And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean. 
Nanotechnology: this is a small generator. 
Just as you move, it generates power. 
There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously. 
And this is the magic one. 
We pump the fluid through one of these systems, and we press the button, and it's analyzed for the genomic character. 
And that's transmitted back to land immediately. 
Grid computing: the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here. 
We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything, like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data. 
The power generation will come from the ocean itself. 
And the next generation fiber will be simply magic. 
It's far beyond what we currently have. 
Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation. 
Here's an example. 
When earthquakes take place, massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor. 
We have a way of addressing that, a new way of addressing that. 
What are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course. 
And they fly into the erupting volcano. 
This is doable. All the pieces are there. 
A laboratory: many of you heard what happened on 9/7. 
Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France. 
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning, and it would be on live TV, if we have interesting things to show. 
So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world, throughout the ocean. 
It's going to be amazing. 
Many of you don't think of this yet, but the ocean will be in your pocket. 
It won't be long. It won't be long. 
So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet, if you'll forgive me. 
In 1943, T.S. Eliot wrote the "Four Quartets." 
He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948. 
Thank you. 
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species. 
And this is, of course, not the first time you've probably recognized this. 
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species. 
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart. 
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there. 
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes. 
But of course, just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude. 
The errors we make are actually predictable. 
We make them again and again. 
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence. 
When we get negative feedback, we still, the next time we're face with a certain context, tend to make the same errors. 
And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature. 
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out? 
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from? 
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities. 
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault. 
We create financial markets that are super complex. 
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with. 
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error. 
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly. 
This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors. 
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way, over and over again. 
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways. 
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it. 
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at. 
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two? 
And so this is why we turned to these guys here. 
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey. 
The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do. 
So she's the perfect test case. 
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans? 
Does she make the same mistakes as us? 
Does she not learn from them? And so on. 
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do. 
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago. 
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly, see if she messes these things up. 
First problem is just, well, where should we start? 
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans. 
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts. 
You know, where are we actually going to start with this? 
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do. 
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff. 
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here. 
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it? 
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money. 
So that's just what we did. 
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency. 
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies, so we just called it a token. 
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much. 
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal. 
It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it. 
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures, they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them. 
They were these kind of weird things. 
But very quickly, the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food. 
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this. 
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn't know. 
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter, and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this. 
Hands it over, and then gets some food. 
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. 
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like. 
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food. 
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy. 
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on. 
So the monkeys get really good at this. 
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training. 
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. 
The question is: is this anything like human money? 
Do the monkeys do anything like this? 
And so our monkey marketplace was born. 
The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure. 
The salesmen were students from my lab. 
They dressed differently; they were different people. 
And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish. 
and that's what the monkey can for a single token. 
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like. 
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short. 
But here's Honey. 
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently. 
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes. 
You can see Honey, very good market economist, goes with the guy who gives more. 
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two. 
So not just Honey, most of the monkeys went with guys who had more. 
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food. 
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that. 
They really cared about their monkey token dollar. 
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do? 
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might. 
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else. 
The other thing we also spontaneously saw, embarrassingly enough, is spontaneous evidence of larceny. 
So we said, this looks bad. 
Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do? 
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit. 
Take these, put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it. 
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want. 
Donate it, take it, and so on. 
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money. 
And here's your choice: you can either be risky, in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens. 
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more. 
If it comes up tails, you get nothing. 
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky. 
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure. 
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks. 
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately. 
So see what your intuition is here. 
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option. 
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure? 
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that. 
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational. 
People are a little risk-averse. So what? 
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently. 
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills. 
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before. 
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet. 
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time, it's a little bit worse. 
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money, but you're going to get the same choice. 
You can either take a risky loss -- so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot. 
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there. 
They actually tend to go a little risky. 
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice. 
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000, or just 1,500 dollars with certainty. 
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with. 
So what's going on? 
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level. 
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms. 
You really have to do work to figure out, well, one option's a thousand, 2,000; one is 1,500. 
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another. 
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less." 
And this leads to the second bias, which economists have called loss aversion. 
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red. 
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money. 
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this. 
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans. 
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms. 
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house -- because they don't want to sell at a loss. 
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases. 
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market, would they do the same thing as people? 
And so this is what this looks like. 
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen. 
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape, so it looks pretty good. 
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses. 
The guy on the left is a safe bonus. 
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two. 
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus. 
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero. 
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra. 
For a big bonus, now they get three. 
But this is the same choice you guys just faced. 
People here played it safe. 
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too. 
Qualitatively and quantitatively, they choose exactly the same way as people, when tested in the same thing. 
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk. 
Maybe we should see how they do with losses. 
And so we ran a second version of this. 
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount. 
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this. 
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect. 
They guy on the left is a safe loss. 
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two. 
the guy on the right is the risky loss. 
And so what do the monkeys do? 
They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started. 
So what does all of this mean? 
But they also do some of the irrational things we do. 
They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do. 
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
A little bad for monkey investors. 
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too. 
Because we've answered the question we started out with. 
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from. 
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that. 
In fact, they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history. 
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. 
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back. 
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results, means that these duncey strategies might be 35 million years old. 
That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really, really old. 
What do we know about other old strategies like this? 
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. 
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake. 
You can't just shut that off. 
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me." 
We're just built differently. 
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. 
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions. 
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news? 
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news. 
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know, I flew over here in an airplane. 
I didn't have to try to flap my wings. 
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you. 
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness. 
We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily. 
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations. 
And here's the rub. 
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is." 
But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them. 
Thank you. 
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole. 
And while that swim took place three years ago, I can remember it as if it was yesterday. 
The water is completely black. 
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade, or 29 degrees Fahrenheit. 
It's flipping freezing in that water. 
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. 
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days. 
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja. 
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier. 
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake. 
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas. 
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, all these countries. 
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. 
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level. 
So it's right up in the heavens. 
It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness. 
That's not the worst part of it. 
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest. 
And we walked up this pathway, all the way up. 
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier. 
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice. 
I could barely breathe. 
I was gasping for air. 
I then began to choke, and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water. 
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on. 
I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have. 
I have never, ever heard such utter bollocks. 
I got myself to the side of the lake. 
My crew grabbed me, and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp. 
And there, we sat down, and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest. 
And my team just gave it to me straight. 
They said, Lewis, you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. 
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming, you must forget. 
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time. 
Take some time to rest and think about things. 
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke. 
And remember, never ever swim with aggression. 
This is the time to swim with real humility. 
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later. 
And I swam across the lake. 
And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side. 
The warning signs are all there. 
When I was born, the world's population was 3.5 billion people. 
We're now 6.8 billion people, and we're expected to be 9 billion people by 2050. 
And then the second lesson, the radical, tactical shift. 
So thank you very, very much. 
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri. 
We lived on less than a dollar a day for about 15 years. 
I got a scholarship, went to university, studied international agriculture, studied anthropology, and decided I was going to give back. 
I was going to work with small farmers. 
I was going to help alleviate poverty. 
I was going to work on international development, and then I took a turn and ended up here. 
It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab. 
You could be in New York. 
Now, what I'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people. 
So I did it: I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps. 
I found out how many people had been put in jail, how many family members had been killed. 
I assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them. 
Now this is God's work, but it's not my work. 
It's not the work I set out to do. 
So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests in 1988. 
I met a guy -- the guy on the left. 
His name was Ben. 
He said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?" 
I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?" 
"I make ice cream." 
So I said, "Well, you've got to make a rainforest ice cream. 
He said, "Okay." 
Within a year, Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves. 
It was a great success. 
We did our first million-dollars-worth of trade by buying on 30 days and selling on 21. 
That gets your adrenaline going. 
Then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit because we were credit-worthy at that point. 
We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent of the global Brazil-nut market. 
We paid two to three times more than anybody else. 
Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise. 
A great success. 
50 companies signed up, 200 products came out, generated 100 million in sales. 
It failed. 
Why did it fail? 
Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests. 
We were attacking the wrong driver. 
We needed to be working on beef. 
We needed to be working on lumber. 
We needed to be working on soy -- things that we were not focused on. 
So let's go back to Sudan. 
And this farmer said to me, one day, something that was very profound. 
He said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep." 
We live on a planet. 
There's just one of them. 
We've got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more and that this is a finite planet. 
We know the limits of the resources we have. 
We may be able to use them differently. 
We may have some innovative, new ideas. 
But in general, this is what we've got. 
There's no more of it. 
There's a basic equation that we can't get away from. 
Population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet, and right now, it's a simple "not equal." 
Our work shows that we're living at about 1.3 planets. 
Since 1990, we crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet. 
Now we're at 1.3. 
If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed. 
For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest. 
This is where we stand today. 
A lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem. 
It's always population growth. 
Population growth's important, but it's also about how much each person consumes. 
It's not just about population, and it's not just about them; it's about us. 
But it's not just about people; it's about lifestyles. 
You think that's not an issue going forward? 
You think that's not a question as to how we should be using the Earth's resources? 
Let's go back and visit our equation. 
In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet. 
They were consuming what they were consuming -- let's say one unit of consumption each. 
We have six billion units of consumption. 
By 2050, we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree. 
So we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption. 
Who have you heard talking lately that's said we have to triple production of goods and services? 
But that's what the math says. 
We're not going to be able to do that. 
We can get productivity up. 
We can get efficiency up. 
But we've also got to get consumption down. 
We need to use less to make more. 
And then we need to use less again. 
And then we need to consume less. 
All of those things are part of that equation. 
But it basically raises a fundamental question: should consumers have a choice about sustainability, about sustainable products? 
Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn't, or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable? 
If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet, how do you make that happen? 
The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S. 
Okay, so let's be generous. 
Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe. 
How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product, the data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis? 
How do you get informed? 
You don't. 
Here's a little question. 
From a greenhouse gas perspective, is lamb produced in the U.K. 
better than lamb produced in New Zealand, frozen and shipped to the U.K.? 
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef? 
Do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes? 
In every single case, the answer is "it depends." 
It depends on who produced it and how, in every single instance. 
And there are many others. 
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield? 
They're not. 
They may have a lot of opinions about it, but they're not going to be terribly informed. 
Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue. 
It's got to be something we all care about. 
And we need collusion. 
We need groups to work together that never have. 
We need Cargill to work with Bunge. 
We need Coke to work with Pepsi. 
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge. 
We need Greenpeace to work with WWF. 
Everybody's got to work together -- China and the U.S. 
But we can't do everything. 
Even if we get everybody working on it, we've got to be strategic. 
We need to focus on the where, the what and the who. 
So, the where: We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work. 
These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view. 
We have to work in these places. 
We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it. 
We looked at the threats to these places. 
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers? 
Let's see, that's about 7,000 languages, 350 major languages -- a lot of work there. 
I don't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively. 
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers? 
Again, a daunting task. 
There must be a better way. 
So, we went through our 15 commodities. 
This is nine of them. 
We lined them up side-by-side, and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those. 
In fact, these names start coming up over and over again. 
So we did the analysis again a slightly different way. 
And what we found is it's 25 percent. 
So 100 companies control 25 percent of the trade of all 15 of the most significant commodities on the planet. 
We can get our arms around a hundred companies. 
A hundred companies, we can work with. 
Why is 25 percent important? 
Because if these companies demand sustainable products, they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production. 
Companies can push producers faster than consumers can. 
After 40 years, the global organic movement has achieved 0.7 of one percent of global food. 
We can't wait that long. 
We don't have that kind of time. 
We need change that's going to accelerate. 
Even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there. 
We need to begin to work with industries. 
It's not all fun and games. 
In salmon aquaculture, we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago. 
Eight entities came to the table. 
We eventually got, I think, 60 percent of global production at the table and 25 percent of demand at the table. 
Three of the original eight entities were suing each other. 
And yet, next week, we launch globally verified, vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture. 
It can happen. 
It's risk and demand. 
For the big companies, it's reputational risk, but more importantly, they don't care what the price of commodities is. 
If they don't have commodities, they don't have a business. 
They care about availability, so the big risk for them is not having product at all. 
So it's the demand that brings them to the table. 
The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago. 
So we're pulling out all the stops. 
We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table. 
The study shows that the highest net present value for palm oil is on land that's been degraded. 
Why is Cargill important? 
Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent of global palm oil. 
If Cargill makes a decision, the entire palm oil industry moves, or at least 40 or 50 percent of it. 
That's not insignificant. 
More importantly, Cargill and one other company ship 50 percent of the palm oil that goes to China. 
It's a pre-competitive issue. 
All the palm oil going there is good. 
Buy it. 
Mars is also on a similar journey. 
It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart because of pet food. 
And what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production. 
The rest of the land can be used for something else. 
It's more with less and less again. 
That's what the future has got to be, and putting it in the public domain is smart. 
They don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company, but they want to be a chocolate company forever. 
That is an externality by definition. 
This is the subsidy from nature. 
There's carbon that's being bought with sugar, with coffee, with beef. 
This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity. 
We can't just focus on identifying the best; we've got to move the rest. 
The issue isn't what to think, it's how to think. 
These companies have begun to think differently. 
They're on a journey; there's no turning back. 
We're all on that same journey with them. 
We have to really begin to change the way we think about everything. 
Thank you. 
So I have a question. 
Please raise your hand if you've ever thought it would be cool to go to the bottom of the ocean in a submarine? 
Yes. 
Most of you, because the oceans are so cool. 
I'm the only one in this room. 
Well, I think about this all the time. 
You don't have to have a PhD in biology to know that that is a bad place to go looking for life. 
And he ran it along with Bo Barker Jørgensen of Denmark. 
And so they were finally able to get good pristine deep subsurface samples some really without contamination from surface microbes. 
You can see the hazy stuff in the background. 
That's mud. That's deep-sea ocean mud, and the bright green dots stained with the green fluorescent dye are real, living microbes. 
Now I've got to tell you something really tragic about microbes. 
They all look the same under a microscope, I mean, to a first approximation. 
It's really annoying. 
So we can't use their looks to tell them apart. 
We have to use DNA, like a fingerprint, to say who is who. 
And I'll teach you guys how to do it right now. 
So I made up some data, and I'm going to show you some data that are not real. 
This is to illustrate what it would look like if a bunch of species were not related to each other at all. 
But this is what real DNA looks like, from a gene that these species happen to share. 
Everything lines up nearly perfectly. 
So we know that all those species had to have had a common ancestor. 
They're all relatives of each other. 
So now I'll tell you who they are. 
The top two are us and chimpanzees, which y'all already knew were related, because, I mean, obviously. 
We're also related to bacteria like E. coli and Clostridium difficile, which is a horrible, opportunistic pathogen that kills lots of people. 
But there's of course good microbes too, like Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, which cleans up our industrial waste for us. 
But we're kin to every living thing on Earth. 
So in my job, on a daily basis, I get to produce scientific evidence against existential loneliness. 
But now check out where they go on our tree of life. 
The first thing you'll notice is that there's a lot of them. 
It wasn't just one little species that managed to live in this horrible place. 
It's kind of a lot of things. 
And the second thing that you'll notice, hopefully, is that they're not like anything we've ever seen before. 
They are as different from each other as they are from anything that we've known before as we are from pine trees. 
So John Parkes was completely correct. 
So now we were on a roll. 
But no matter what we fed them, they refused to grow. 
And it's not for lack of trying. 
That may sound disappointing, but I actually find it exhilarating, because it means there are so many tantalizing unknowns to work on. 
Like, my colleagues and I got what we thought was a really great idea. 
But when we looked at their genes, it turns out that what they wanted to eat was the food we were already feeding them. 
So that was a total wash. 
There was something else that they wanted in their petri dishes that we were just not giving them. 
Humans, on the other hand, require about 100 watts of power. 
So 100 watts is basically if you take a pineapple and drop it from about waist height to the ground 881,632 times a day. 
That's all it takes to make these microbes live. 
So that's why we never find them in our throats. 
Perhaps the fact that the deep subsurface is so boring is actually an asset to these microbes. 
They never get washed out by a storm. 
They never get overgrown by weeds. 
All they have to do is exist. 
Maybe that thing that we were missing in our petri dishes was not food at all. 
Maybe it wasn't a chemical. 
Maybe the thing that they really want, the nutrient that they want, is time. 
But time is the one thing that I'll never be able to give them. 
It's just not possible. 
But maybe in a way we already have grown them in our petri dishes. 
Why does a cell die after a day and a human dies after only a hundred years? 
These seem like really arbitrarily short limits when you think about the total amount of time in the universe. 
But these are not arbitrary limits. 
They're dictated by one simple thing, and that thing is the Sun. 
Once life figured out how to harness the energy of the Sun through photosynthesis, we all had to speed up and get on day and night cycles. 
In that way, the Sun gave us both a reason to be fast and the fuel to do it. 
You can view most of life on Earth like a circulatory system, and the Sun is our beating heart. 
But the deep subsurface is like a circulatory system that's completely disconnected from the Sun. 
It's instead being driven by long, slow geological rhythms. 
There's currently no theoretical limit on the lifespan of one single cell. 
What if it involves some cool, ultra-stable compounds that we could use to increase the shelf life in biomedical or industrial applications? 
I don't know. 
That's 200 times more than the total biomass of humans on this planet. 
And those microbes have a fundamentally different relationship with time and energy than we do. 
What seems like a day to them might be a thousand years to us. 
They don't care about the Sun, and they don't care about growing fast, and they probably don't give a damn about my petri dishes ... 
Thank you. 
But I want to start with what I call the "official dogma." 
The official dogma of what? 
The official dogma of all Western industrial societies. 
The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. 
The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have. 
This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. 
And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. 
I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. 
This is my supermarket. 
Not such a big one. 
I want to say just a word about salad dressing. 
So this is what the supermarket is like. 
We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. 
You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. 
In other domains -- the world of communications. 
You rented your phone, you didn't buy it. 
One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke. 
And those days are gone. 
We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones. 
These are cell phones of the future. 
My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and crème brûlée torch. 
And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores, asking this question. 
And do you know what the answer to this question now is? 
The answer is "no." 
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much. 
So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true. 
Health care. 
It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do. 
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B. 
A has these benefits and these risks. 
B has these benefits and these risks. 
What do you want to do?" 
And you say, "Doc, what should I do?" 
And the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks. 
And you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?" 
And the doc says, "But I'm not you." 
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them? 
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed. 
Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indicate. 
We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it. 
And we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like. 
And that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. 
The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after. 
Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs. 
I teach wonderfully intelligent students, and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to. 
And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less diligent. 
It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves, "Should I get married or not? Should I get married now? 
Should I get married later? 
All of these are consuming questions. 
And indeed they should. 
These are important questions to answer. 
Work. 
I'm not telling you about it, because I want to use it. 
Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?" 
So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice. 
And the world we used to live in looked like this. 
[Well, actually, they are written in stone.] That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice. 
The world we now live in looks like this. 
[The Ten Commandments Do-It-Yourself Kit] And the question is: Is this good news or bad news? 
And the answer is "yes." 
All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people. 
One effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation. 
With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. 
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this, a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. 
What she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent. 
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. 
Why? 
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. 
And I think it makes the world look like this. 
You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or wrong salad dressing. 
So that's one effect. 
And there are several reasons for this. 
Second, what economists call "opportunity costs." 
Here's an example. 
Here's what you're supposed to be thinking. 
Here's this couple on the Hamptons. Very expensive real estate. 
Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. 
What could be better? 
"Damn it," this guy is thinking, "It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. 
I could be parking right in front of my building." 
And the more options there are to consider, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. 
Here's another example. 
It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly. 
This hit me when I went to replace my jeans. 
I wear jeans almost all the time. 
I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones. 
I said, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size." 
And the shopkeeper said, "Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit? 
You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed? 
Do you want them distressed? 
Do you want boot cut, tapered?" Blah, blah, blah on and on he went. 
My jaw dropped. 
And after I recovered, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kind." 
I did better. 
All this choice made it possible for me to do better. 
But -- I felt worse. 
Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. 
I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. 
When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect. 
And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect. 
And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results. 
The truth is more like this. 
You will never be pleasantly surprised, because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof. 
The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is: low expectations. 
I couldn't have done better. 
I didn't settle. 
But settling isn't always such a bad thing. 
What could you do? 
You could have done better. 
With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure. 
Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. 
So the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse. 
It is not true. 
There's no question that some choice is better than none. 
But it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. 
There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. 
I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare. 
Their problem is they have too little. 
So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies. 
It's a waste of money. 
What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't help. 
They actually hurt. 
They actually make us worse off. 
This is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move." 
So to conclude. 
[You can be anything you want to be -- no limits.] You're supposed to read this cartoon and, being a sophisticated person, say, "Ah! What does this fish know? Nothing is possible in this fishbowl." 
Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world -- that's the way I read it at first. 
The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. 
Because the truth of the matter is, if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. 
You have paralysis. 
If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction. 
You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction. 
Everybody needs a fishbowl. 
This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us. 
But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and, I suspect, disaster. 
Thank you very much. 
The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages. 
It, however, is enormous in both scale and importance. 
Look, you all are very well traveled; this is TEDGlobal after all. 
But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before. 
So, let's start off in China. 
This photo was taken two weeks ago. 
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school. 
Many of you have been there. It's not the real China. 
Let me take you to the real China. 
This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China. 
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts. 
She lives with her parents, her two brothers and her great-aunt. 
They have a hut that has no electricity, no running water, no wristwatch, no bicycle. 
And they share this great splendor with a very large pig. 
You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies. 
Why would we waste this money on you?" 
This is what happens to girls in remote areas. 
Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. 
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors. 
We wrote about her in The New York Times. 
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school. 
He was delighted. 
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school. 
I can give scholarships to all the girls, you know, if they work hard and stay in school. 
So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school. 
She went to high school. 
She went to vocational school for accounting. 
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south. 
She found a job, she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends. 
She sent money back to her family. 
They built a new house, this time with running water, electricity, a bicycle, no pig. 
What we saw was a natural experiment. 
It is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education. 
She not only changed her own dynamic, she changed her household, she changed her family, her village. 
The village became a real standout. 
And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of "Half the Sky." 
And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity. 
In the 19th century, it was slavery. 
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism. 
The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender. 
So some of you may be thinking, "Gosh, that's hyperbole. 
She's exaggerating." 
Well, let me ask you this question. 
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world? 
Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world? 
Hands up, please. 
How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world? 
Okay, most of you. 
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong. 
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case. 
In fact, demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the current population. 
And, you know, it happens for several reasons. 
Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram. 
Girls get aborted before they're even born when there are scarce resources. 
This girl here, for instance, is in a feeding center in Ethiopia. 
The entire center was filled with girls like her. 
What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family, were totally fine. 
From one to five, girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys, in all of India. 
Poverty, for instance. 
There are three reasons why this is the case. 
For one, overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty. 
And you know, when you educate a boy, his family tends to have fewer kids, but only slightly. 
When you educate a girl, she tends to have significantly fewer kids. 
The second reason is it has to do with spending. 
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals. 
If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket, you would have a transformative effect. 
The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution, not the problem. 
You need to use scarce resources. 
It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju. 
Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia. 
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves. 
However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier. 
On this side was men, and then the barrier, and this side was women. 
Do you think we'll make it?" 
So here is Bill of Arabia. 
I would say, on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking. 
And I'll just say two things about this. 
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the 1780s: there were about 80,000 slaves transported from Africa to the New World. 
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders, which is a substantial portion. 
And if you look at another factor, another contrast, a slave back then is worth about $40,000 in today's money. 
Today, you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars, which means she's actually more disposable. 
But you know, there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand. 
We don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed. 
The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality. 
You know, childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event. 
In Niger, one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth. 
Around the world, one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth. 
You know, for every woman who does die, there are 20 who survive but end up with an injury. 
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula. 
It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent. 
Let me tell you about Mahabuba. 
She lives in Ethiopia. 
She was married against her will at age 13. 
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula. 
So that meant she was incontinent; she couldn't control her wastes. 
In a word, she stank. 
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her. 
So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut. 
They ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night. 
That night, there was a stick in the hut. 
She fought off the hyenas with that stick. 
And the next morning, she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary, she would be saved. 
Because she had some damage to her nerves, she crawled all the way -- 30 miles -- to that doorstep, half dead. 
The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor, she was really clever, and they made her a nurse. 
So now, Mahabuba, she is saving the lives of hundreds, thousands, of women. 
She has become part of the solution, not the problem. 
She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. 
I've talked about some of the challenges, let me talk about some of the solutions, and there are predictable solutions. 
I've hinted at them: education and also economic opportunity. 
With economic opportunity, it can be transformative. 
Let me tell you about Saima. 
She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan. 
And at the time, she was miserable. 
She was beaten every single day by her husband, who was unemployed. 
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her. 
Saima's not going to produce you a son." 
This is when she had her second daughter. 
At the time, there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a 65-dollar loan. 
Saima took that money, and she started an embroidery business. 
The merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well, and they kept asking for more. 
And when she couldn't produce enough, she hired other women in the village. 
Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village working for her embroidery business. 
So now they're in it together. 
He does the transportation and distribution, and she does the production and sourcing. 
And now they have a third daughter, and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education because Saima knows what's really important. 
Which brings me to the final element, which is education. 
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira. 
Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border, and like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school. 
Actually, she had never been to school, not to a lick, one day. 
Her parents, again, said, "Why should we spend the money on her? 
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth." 
They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International. 
Heifer sent two goats to Africa. 
One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents, and that goat had twins. 
The twins started producing milk. 
They sold the milk for cash. 
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school. 
She rocketed to the top of her class. 
Two years ago, she graduated from Connecticut College. 
On the day of her graduation, she said, "I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat." 
So you see how transformative little bits of help can be. 
But I want to give you a reality check. 
Look: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy, and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid. 
There's Bill Easterly's book. 
There's a book called "Dead Aid." 
You know, the criticism is fair; it isn't easy. 
You know, people say how half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed. 
He sort of mumbled. 
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project. 
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop. 
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there. 
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater; you actually improve. 
You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve. 
We also think that individuals can make a difference, and they should, because individuals, together, we can all help create a movement. 
So then, I ask, what's in it for you? 
You're probably asking that. Why should you care? 
I will just leave you with two things. 
One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. 
And the second thing, it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with. 
And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur. 
Here was a woman who had worked in Darfur, seeing things that no human being should see. 
Throughout her time there, she was strong, she was steadfast. 
She never broke down. 
And then she came back to the United States and was on break, Christmas break. 
She was in her grandmother's backyard, and she saw something that made her break down in tears. 
What that was was a bird feeder. 
And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility. 
And so, like her, you, me, we have all won the lottery of life. 
And so the question becomes: how do we discharge that responsibility? 
So, here's the cause. 
Join the movement. 
Feel happier and help save the world. 
Thank you very much. 
And so a year ago, I showed this off at a computer show called E3. 
And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. 
And there was a huge row online about, "Hey, this can't be real." 
And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech. 
Now, this tech incorporates three big elements. 
So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now. 
This is Dimitri. 
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around. 
Now, you notice he's sitting. 
There are no controllers, no keyboards, or mice, or joysticks, or joypads. 
So let's move forward. 
You're going to meet Milo for the first time. 
He was quite a know-it-all, and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. 
So the problem we introduced to him was this: he's just moved house. 
He's moved from London to New England, over in America. 
So here he is walking through the grass. 
And you're able to interact with his world. 
The cool thing is, what we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly. 
That means no two people's Milos can be the same. 
You're actually sculpting a human being here. 
So, he's discovering the garden. 
You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails. 
Very simple at the start. 
His face, by the way, is fully AI-driven. 
We have complete control over his blush responses, the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress. 
We actually do something called body matching. 
Now we've used the hand. 
The other thing to use is your body. 
You can lean back, but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. 
So Dimitri's now going to use -- he's used his hand; he's used his body. 
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential, and that's his voice. 
Now, the thing about voice is, our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful, isn't it? 
It never works. 
You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu. 
So we've tackled that problem, and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second. 
Milo: I could just squish it. 
Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri? 
Do you want Milo to squash it? 
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it. 
PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do. 
Now look at his response. 
He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it." 
What we're using there is, we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme. 
It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago. 
We've got a database of words which we recognize. 
We pick those words out. 
Now we need to have a bit more engagement, and again, what we can do is we can look at the body. 
And we'll do that in a second. 
Milo: I wonder how deep it is. 
Deep. 
PM: Okay. So what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones. 
We're actually teaching him. 
It's very, very interesting that men, more than women, tend to be more competitive here. 
Okay, this is skimming stones. 
How do you skim stones? 
You stand up, and you skim the stone. 
It's that simple. 
Just recognizing your body, recognizing the body's motions, the tech, understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up. 
Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better. 
Try hitting the boat. 
Milo: Ahhh. So close. 
PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive. 
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done. 
Milo: Okay. 
PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents, giving us time to be alone and to help him out. 
And we're going to help him with this now. 
But this is going to be an introduction, and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use. 
Now, to do that, we needed a set up, like a magician's trick. 
And what we did was, we needed to give Milo this big problem. 
So as Dimitri starts tidying up, you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. 
PM: So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor, on the brand-new carpet. 
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children. 
Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down. 
It's all been too much for him. 
He's just moved house. He's got no friends. 
Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. 
Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. 
Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like. 
They're always getting stressed. 
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway? 
We don't know anyone. 
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to. 
You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends. 
Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all. 
Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo. 
You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. 
Milo: It was good skimming stones. 
This looks nice. 
You cleaned up my room. 
Thanks. 
PM: So after three-quarters of an hour, he recognizes you. 
And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen, that is a truly wonderful moment. 
Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side. 
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging -- he's got to go to school. 
His mind is based in a cloud. 
That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer. 
He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. 
And I love those revolutions, and I love the future that Milo brings. 
Thank you very much indeed. 
This talk is about righting writing wrongs. 
No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs. 
The Middle East is huge, and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh. 
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences. 
We need to take our responsibilities seriously, but not ourselves. 
Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East. 
Working in London as TV maker and writer, I quickly realized that comedy connects audiences. 
It's still going strong, with positive press to die for. 
And wherever they went, they killed. 
Now, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it. 
I moved to Dubai as the head of original content for a Western TV network. 
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience. 
Now, the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy. 
In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went, "Berfect." 
who had started a successful new tribe. 
And I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success. 
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy. 
I had four phases to this plan. 
First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it. 
Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done. 
I excitedly presented this to the big boss, and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it." 
Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007. 
Here's how the dots connected. 
Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ... 
Let's just say "value for money." 
And one more thing: No, don't F it up." 
So I quickly went to work with a great team around me. 
This is all true. 
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East. 
I'd say, watch any successful well-written, family-friendly sitcom in the West for your answers. 
Now, were the Axis successful? 
In five countries, in just under a month, we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live. 
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news. 
In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them. 
In fact, they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD, even before it was released in the Middle East. 
Anywhere you go. 
So everywhere we went, we auditioned amateurs. 
We filmed that process and aired a documentary. 
It really is his name. 
And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause. 
In Dubai this year, we've just had the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show. 
And notice two of them are wearing headscarves, and yes, even they can laugh. 
Dubai, to me, is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen. 
20 years ago, no one had heard of it. 
Look at it now. 
These comics are now going to the New York festival. 
So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image, and it's exploding. 
For example, when Dean talks, the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel." 
Well, if you're used to listening to comedians, then I'm not surprised. 
Enough. 
We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel. 
We have a positive story to tell and image to sell. 
In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience, we love to laugh like hell. 
One: Is the Middle East being shown in a current time and correct context? 
Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted. 
We've started in our region. 
My challenge to the rest of the world is please, start using positive Middle Eastern images in your stories. 
I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East, with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs to put quill to parchment. 
As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;" as my mother would say, "Shakespeare." 
Thank you. 
I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. 
He went out solo and did it first. 
Then there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American. 
And then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group. 
Now, being Iranian-American presents its own set of problems, as you know. 
Those two countries aren't getting along these days. 
So it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know, like part of me likes me, part of me hates me. 
These are dilemmas I have every day. 
So I remember getting my American passport. 
I was like, "Woo-hoo! I'm going to travel." 
And I opened it up, it said, "Born in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!" 
Where I've had problems is in some of the Arab countries. 
I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either. 
Then the border patrol saw my American passport: "Ah-ha! American, great." 
Then he opened it up. "Born in Iran? Wait." 
He said, "What is your father's name?" 
I said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro." 
He goes, "What is your grandfather's name?" 
I said, "He passed away a long time ago. 
He says, "You wait. I'll be back," and he walked away. 
And I started freaking out, because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into. 
You owe us two billion dollars." 
They go, "Great! And then you hijack the hospital." 
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys. 
I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank. 
I want to rob a bank in a film, but do it with a gun, not with a bomb strapped around me, right? 
"Why would I do that? 
If I want the money, why would I kill myself?" 
All it takes in one person to mess it up. 
Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York, there was a Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb. 
Now, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show. 
And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing. 
My question is: Why would you take credit for a failed car bombing? 
"We just want to say: we tried." 
And the name came out: Jack. I'm like, "Woooo! That's not one of us!" 
"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?" 
I just did a seven-country solo tour. 
I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia. 
I was in Dubai. 
And it's great, there's good people everywhere. 
And you learn great things about these places. 
I encourage people always to go visit these places. 
For example, Dubai -- cool place. 
They're obsessed with having the biggest, tallest, longest, as we all know. 
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall. 
I was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!" I'm like, "What are you doing here?" 
He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away. 
Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way." 
Like in the Dubai Mall, they sell frozen yogurt by the gram. 
It's like a drug deal. 
I was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst! Habibi, my friend." 
I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram. How many gram do you want?" 
He's like, "Good stuff, man. Colombian. Top of the line." 
For example, I took my two-year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall. 
And I've taken him to playgrounds all over the United States. 
Not in the Middle East. 
And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. 
And they don't get paid that well. 
And I got it in my head that all the Indians must be workers. 
I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai too. 
I was doing a show, and they said, "We'll send a driver to pick you up." 
I went down to the lobby, and saw this Indian guy. 
I go, "He must be my driver," since he's standing there in a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me. 
I say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?" 
He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel." 
He goes, "I thought you were my driver." 
I hope that in the coming years, more film and television programs come out of Hollywood, presenting us in a positive light. 
Who knows? Maybe one day, we'll even have our own James Bond. Right? 
"My name is Bond. 
Jamal Bond." 
Have a good day. Thank you. 
My name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR. 
I'm a proud Princeton dropout. 
Also proud to have relocated here to Boston, where I actually grew up. 
Easy wins, I should just name the counties that we've got around here. 
I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world. 
And it looks like this right now. 
It looks like the Web did back in 1997, right? 
It's not very good. It's cluttered. 
It's filled with lots of different things that, in short, aren't that fun. 
They're not very well-designed. 
But luckily, as my favorite action hero, Bob the Builder, says, "We can do better. We can build this better." 
And the tools, the resources that we use to build a game layer, are game dynamics themselves. 
Hopefully for good. 
Before we jump into that, there's a question of: Why is this important? 
And that's OK, right? A lot of people are very happy with Facebook. 
I like it quite a lot. 
They've created this thing called the Open Graph, and they own all of our connections. 
They own half a billion people. 
So when you want to build on the social layer, the framework has been decided; it is the Open Graph API. 
And if you're happy with that, fantastic. 
If you're not, too bad. There's nothing you can do. 
And that's a real thing. 
So, the social layer is all about these connections. 
The game layer is all about influence. 
That's really, really powerful. 
And it's going to be more important than the social layer, and affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly. 
And the resources we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have. 
Back at SCVNGR, we like to joke that with seven game dynamics, you can get anyone to do anything. 
It's called the appointment dynamic. 
This sort of "loss of free will" that occurs in games can be frightening. 
So the first one, the most famous appointment dynamic in the world, is something called, "Happy Hour." 
This game dynamic is so powerful, it doesn't just influence our behavior; it's influenced our entire culture. 
That's a really scary thought, that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully. 
It also exists in more conventional game forms. 
I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now. 
If you haven't, I recommend playing it. 
You won't do anything else for the rest of your day. 
Farmville has more active users than Twitter. 
They will return, like clockwork, at different times. 
But this could also be used for good. 
That's an appointment. 
It's something that people don't do very well. 
This isn't a game yet, but really should be. 
You should get points for doing it on time and lose points for not doing it on time. 
They should recognize they've built an appointment dynamic, and leverage the games. 
Then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways. 
We're going to jump onto the next one. 
Influence and status. 
This is one of the most famous game dynamics, used all over the place. 
It's used in your wallets, right now. 
We all want that credit card on the far left, because it's black. 
And this is used in games as well. 
"Modern Warfare," one of the most successful selling games of all time. 
And that's very powerful to me. 
Status is really good motivator. 
It's also used in more conventional settings, and can be used more consciously there. 
There are levels. There are C. There are B. There's A. 
There are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status? 
But let's use it consciously. 
Why have games you can lose? Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C? 
That sucks. Why not level-up? 
And it's very powerful. 
It can be used in interesting ways. 
This is used all over the place, including LinkedIn, where I am an unwhole individual. 
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn, and that bothers me. 
We will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen. 
This is used in conventional games as well. 
I mean, this is a Paladin level 10, and that's a Paladin level 20. 
I would. 
And so people work very hard to level-up. 
"World of Warcraft" is one of the most successful games of all time. 
And they have these systems where you can level-up. 
And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful. 
It can also be used in very compelling ways for good. 
And here, we have a game that people play. 
They go places, do challenges, earn points. 
These progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world. 
This is used in some famous consumer web stories like Digg, which I'm sure you've all heard of. 
Digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news, the most interesting stories. 
And they made this into a game, initially. 
They had a leader board where, if you recommended the best stories, you would get points. 
And that really motivated people to find the best stories. 
The game became more powerful than the goal. 
So we have to use this one carefully. 
And in 12 hours, they were able to find all these balloons, all across the country. 
Really powerful dynamic. 
This next decade is the decade of games. 
We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare. 
We can influence behavior. 
It's very powerful. It's very exciting. 
Let's all build it together, let's do it well and have fun playing. 
It feels like we're all suffering from information overload or data glut. 
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that, and that's using our eyes more. 
Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool. 
So, let's see. 
That is, they're meaningless without context: 500 billion for this pipeline, 20 billion for this war. 
It doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively. 
So I scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts. 
And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money. 
So purple is "fighting," and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering." 
And what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers. 
You can literally see them. 
Let me point out some that I really like. 
This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here -- 780 billion a year. 
And this little pixel in the corner -- three billion -- that's their climate change fund. 
Then of course, the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion back in 2003. 
And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to 3,000 billion. 
So now it's great because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well. 
So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt. 
How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that Africa owes to the West? 
Let's take a look. 
So there it is: 227 billion is what Africa owes. 
And the recent financial crisis, how much of this diagram might that figure take up? 
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that. 
Dooosh -- Which I think is the appropriate sound effect for that much money: 11,900 billion. 
And when you're lost in information, an information map is kind of useful. 
So I want to show you another landscape now. 
We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like. 
Let's take a look. 
This is Mountains Out of Molehills, a timeline of global media panic. 
Let me point them out. 
So this, swine flu -- pink. 
Bird flu. 
SARS -- brownish here. Remember that one? 
The millennium bug, terrible disaster. 
These little green peaks are asteroid collisions. 
Let me highlight it for you. 
See this line, this is a landscape for violent video games. 
As you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data, twin peaks every year. 
If we look closer, we see those peaks occur at the same month every year. 
Why? 
Well, November, Christmas video games come out, and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content. 
But April isn't a particularly massive month for video games. 
Why April? 
You have retrospectives, anniversaries, court cases, even copy-cat shootings, all pushing that fear into the agenda. 
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it? 
Why is there a gap there? 
You see where it starts? September 2001, when we had something very real to be scared about. 
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium. 
And, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit. 
But if you look at it directly, it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts. 
But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way, interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed. 
Let me show you this. 
Can you guess what this data set is? 
I'll take answers. 
You might want to get some chocolate in. 
Any other guesses? 
Yeah, retail therapy might help. 
Shall we see? 
Who would do that? 
So there's a titanic amount of data out there now, unprecedented. 
So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful. 
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful. 
And here's my visual C.V. 
I'm not quite sure I've succeeded. 
Pretty blocky, the colors aren't that great. 
But I wanted to convey something to you. 
And I've never been to design school. 
I've never studied art or anything. 
I just kind of learned through doing. 
And when I started designing, I discovered an odd thing about myself. 
And I don't feel like I'm unique. 
I feel that everyday, all of us now are being blasted by information design. 
There's something almost quite magical about visual information. 
It's effortless, it literally pours in. 
So here we go. This is your senses, pouring into your senses every second. 
Your sense of sight is the fastest. 
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network. 
Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key. 
And then you have hearing and smell, which has the throughput of a hard disk. 
And then you have poor old taste, which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator. 
And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent, that's the amount we're actually aware of. 
So a lot of your vision -- the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in. 
It's unconscious. 
The eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern. 
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful. 
It's the language of the eye. 
So, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts. 
And that whole thing -- it's two languages both working at the same time. 
So we can use this new kind of language, if you like, to alter our perspective or change our views. 
Let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer: Who has the biggest military budget? 
It's got to be America, right? 
Massive. 609 billion in 2008 -- 607, rather. 
So massive, in fact, that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself. 
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble. 
Now, you can see Africa's total debt there and the U.K. budget deficit for reference. 
But is it true that America has the biggest military budget? 
Because America is an incredibly rich country. 
So its military budget is bound to be enormous. 
Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP? 
Let's have a look. 
That changes the picture considerably. 
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering, and American drops into eighth. 
Now you can also do this with soldiers. 
Who has the most soldiers? It's got to be China. 
Of course, 2.1 million. 
But of course, China has an enormous population. 
So if we do the same, we see a radically different picture. 
China drops to 124th. 
It actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration. 
So, absolute figures, like the military budget, in a connected world, don't give you the whole picture. 
They're not as true as they could be. 
As Hans Rosling, the master, my master, said, "Let the dataset change your mindset." 
And if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior. 
Take a look at this one. 
I'm a bit of a health nut. 
There's always conflicting evidence. 
Should I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass? 
This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. 
This kind of diagram is called a balloon race. 
So the higher up the image, the more evidence there is for each supplement. 
And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits. 
Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work. 
We scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed, the biomedical database, and we compiled them and graded them all. 
But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression. 
It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space. 
So it spawns itself. 
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff that affects heart health." 
So let's filter that out. 
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that. 
Now this app is spawning itself from the data. 
The data is all stored in a Google Doc, and it's literally generating itself from that data. 
So the data is now alive; this is a living image, and I can update it in a second. 
New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet. 
Doosh! Again, the image recreates itself. 
So it's cool. 
It's kind of living. 
But it can go beyond data, and it can go beyond numbers. 
I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts. 
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. 
You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them. 
It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual. 
I mean, I find information just too interesting. 
It has a magnetic quality that draws me in. 
So, visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems. 
Even when the information is terrible, the visual can be quite beautiful. 
Which was emitting the most CO2? 
Was it the planes or the volcano, the grounded planes or the volcano? 
So we can have a look. 
So essentially, we had our first carbon-neutral volcano. 
The ice of Antarctica glows with a light so dazzling, it blinds the unprotected eye. 
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. 
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level, beneath its weight. 
Yet, the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. 
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. 
And here, scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change. 
This past January, I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide, about 600 miles from the South Pole. 
It is the best place on the planet, many say, to study the history of climate change. 
What is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures? 
It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising. 
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record. 
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. 
WAIS Divide itself though, is a circle of tents in the snow. 
It snows so heavily there, the installation was almost immediately buried. 
They have to dig themselves out every day. 
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. 
It's really a time machine. 
Periodically, they remove a cylinder of ice, like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill. 
They inspect it, they check it for cracks, for drill damage, for spalls, for chips. 
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion. 
This wall of undisturbed snow, back-lit by sunlight, shows the striations of winter and summer snow, layer upon layer. 
From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things. 
Most importantly, these cylinders and this snow trap air. 
And this is the object of their scrutiny. 
But don't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases? 
Why do we need to study this anymore? 
Don't we already know how they affect temperatures? 
Don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization? 
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse. 
This process requires extraordinary precautions. 
The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. 
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey, they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. 
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics. 
So, in the coldest place on Earth, they work inside a refrigerator. 
They work against the clock and against the thermometer. 
So far, they've packed up about 4,500 feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States. 
This past season, they manhandled them across the ice to waiting aircraft. 
Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter -- the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world. 
Here, the ice seems a living presence. 
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice. 
It is a voice of experience. 
It is a voice we should heed. 
Thank you. 
Cartoons are basically short stories. 
I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words. 
Not all of them have happy endings. 
So how did I get started cartooning? 
So you have to make a living cartooning. 
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks. 
This is some of my early work. 
Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away, so it was [unclear]. 
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean. 
It's just a big blue surface. 
And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time. 
It's a mystery. 
There's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean, mostly negative. 
This part's not going to be on the test." 
This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys. 
I saw forests and meadows. 
And best of all, I saw the animals. 
I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in. 
And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it, and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born. 
Up until that day, these were the animals that were most common in my life. 
These were the ones I'd like to draw -- all variations of four legs and fur. 
But when you got to the ocean, my imagination was no competition for nature. 
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie. 
Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them, the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive. 
It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale, animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean. 
Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago. 
So you have living dinosaurs and space aliens, animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions. 
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. 
Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water make it look like it's floating in outer space. 
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that? 
It would start a whole new space race. 
But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean, and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination as a society. 
We say to ourselves, "Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something." 
So, what I'd like to do now is try a little drawing. 
So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here. 
I love to draw the deep sea fish, because they are so ugly, but beautiful in their own way. 
Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here -- give him a headlight, maybe a brake light, turn signals. 
But it's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters, their shapes and sizes. 
So some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book. 
For instance, take these sea turtles. 
They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x-ray vision. 
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth. 
And they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean. 
I kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with. 
Or take this sea cucumber. 
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all. 
He's like an underwater Spiderman. 
He shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy. 
Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears, which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero. 
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk. 
It can change its body into a big, intimidating fish in a matter of seconds. 
I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated. 
And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here. 
Let's see. 
Try and inflate it. 
Or take this swordfish. 
Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose? 
Do you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says, "Somebody's getting stabbed today." 
Or this lionfish for instance. 
Imagine trying to make friends covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs. 
It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right? 
My characters are -- my lead character's a shark named Sherman. 
He's a great white shark. 
And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman. 
I didn't want to go with this ruthless predator image. 
He's kind of just out there making a living. 
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins. 
And then his sidekick is a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore. 
He uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans, looking for a mate. 
And he does manage to find them, but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines. 
He never seems to settle on any particular girl. 
And then I'll introduce you to one more character, this guy, Ernest, who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body. 
So with characters, you can make stories. 
Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens. 
So, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom. 
For instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range, which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic. 
I've taken them to the Sea of Japan, where they met giant jellyfish. 
I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California. 
This next one here, I did a story on the census of marine life. 
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters. 
So we start off the story with Ernest, who volunteers as a census taker. 
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish. 
I did another story on marine debris. 
And they said -- this one friend of mine said, "I've got one word for you: plastic." 
And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that. 
Plastic just is not going to do it." 
We sort of worked things out. 
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride, which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well. 
I couldn't fit them in. 
So what I did was I made an adventure strip. 
Basically, this bottle travels a long way. 
What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away; it just continues to wash downstream. 
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho, where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system. 
So that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along. 
So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway, but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one. 
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult. 
It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly about this issue. 
It's cruel, it's wasteful. 
There's nothing funny or entertaining about it, but I really wanted to take this issue on. 
I had to kill my main character, who is a shark. 
And then he dies. 
He gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard. 
Ostensibly, he's dead now. 
And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years. 
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one. 
Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup. 
I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue. 
Sherman's up in shark heaven. 
This is what I love about comic strips, you know. 
You can kind of do anything. 
It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman. 
Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet. 
And he clicks the "buy now" button. 
And voila, next-day air, they show up, and they surgically reattach them. 
I'd like to end with a little metaphor here. 
I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue, and this is what I came up with. 
Imagine you're in an enormous room, and it's as dark as a cave. 
And you can have anything in that room, anything you want, but you can't see anything. 
You've been given one tool, a hammer. 
So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something, and it feels like it's made of stone. 
And you take the piece out into the daylight. 
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster. 
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something." 
So you go back into the room, and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away. 
And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away. 
And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff. 
And you hear other people doing the same thing. 
So you get this sense of urgency, like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible. 
And then some yells, "Stop!" 
And they turn up the lights. 
And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre. 
And you've taken all this complexity and beauty, and you've turned it into a cheap commodity. 
And that's what we're doing with the ocean. 
And part of what Mission Blue is about is yelling, "Stop!" 
so that each of us -- explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef -- can turn up the lights in their own way. 
And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way. 
That's why I like what I do. 
Thanks for listening. 
It's wonderful to be back. 
I love this wonderful gathering. 
And you must be wondering, "What on earth? 
Have they put up the wrong slide?" 
No, no. 
Look at this magnificent beast, and ask the question: Who designed it? 
This is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design, and there's a dairy cow. 
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. 
And I was thinking, how do I introduce this? 
And you might say, "Well, God designed the cow." 
But, of course, God got a lot of help. 
This is the ancestor of cattle. 
This is the aurochs. 
And it was designed by natural selection, the process of natural selection, over many millions of years. 
And then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago. 
Now, why am I talking about cows? 
Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. 
Religions are natural phenomena -- they're just as natural as cows. 
They have evolved over millennia. 
They have a biological base, just like the aurochs. 
They have become domesticated, and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. 
This is TED, and I want to talk about design. 
And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. 
And that is the spell that I want to break. 
I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon. 
Today's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed. 
And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. 
And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today. 
And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly, with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country. 
And as long as you teach them that, you can teach them anything else you like. 
That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. 
But also let them know about other religions. 
Now, why do I say that? 
Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. 
Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. 
Misinformed consent is not worth it. 
It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really. 
Democracy depends on informed consent. 
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. 
Now, children below the age of consent are a special case. 
Parents -- I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children. 
They don't own them. 
You can't own your children. 
You have a responsibility to the world, to the state, to them, to take care of them right. 
The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. 
One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it "totalitarian." 
It strikes me as practically libertarian. 
Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic? 
I don't think so. 
All I'm saying is -- and facts, facts only; no values, just facts -- about all the world's religions. 
Another reviewer called it "hilarious." 
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. 
I don't think that's defensible. 
But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later. 
But now I'm going to move on. 
Back to the cow. 
That's the steward. 
Cows couldn't live without human stewards -- they're domesticated. 
They're a sort of ectosymbiont. 
They depend on us for their survival. 
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. 
I'm going to talk about sheep, too. 
There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. 
How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds! 
They could outsource all their problems: protection from predators, food-finding ... 
What a deal! 
"How clever of sheep!" you might say. 
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. 
They were clueless. 
Whose clever move was it? 
It was the clever move of natural selection itself. 
Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. 
Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy, and Orgel's Second Rule is: Evolution is cleverer than you are. 
Now, that is not Intelligent Design -- not from Francis Crick. 
Evolution is cleverer than you are. 
If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax. 
The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant. 
Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. 
But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design. 
When I was here four years ago, I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. 
So it was sort of a spooky story. 
And I think some people may have misunderstood. 
Lancet flukes aren't smart. 
I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there, somewhere between petunia and carrot. 
They're not really bright. They don't have to be. 
The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. 
The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head. 
It doesn't have to be. 
That's the way evolution works. 
Question: Was domestication good for sheep? 
It was great for their genetic fitness. 
And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. 
That was just 10,000 years ago. 
What is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us? 
98 percent. 
That is what we have done on this planet. 
We now wield the paintbrush." 
We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. 
Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. 
And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. 
The key to our domination of the planet is culture. 
And the key to culture is religion. 
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. 
They would be puzzled by many things. 
Anybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is. 
Here's a big crowd. 
Here's another crowd in Mecca. 
They'd want to know how it originated, what it was for and how it perpetuates itself. 
Actually, I'm going to pass over this. 
The ant isn't alone. 
True story. 
Does that ever happen to us? 
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully. 
The Arabic word "Islam" means "submission." 
It means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah." 
But I'm not just talking about Islam. 
I'm talking also about Christianity. 
This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago. 
The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. 
Same idea. Well, not quite. 
But in fact, Christians, too ... 
I'll give you a few quotes. 
"The heart of worship is surrender. 
Surrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense." 
Those words are by Rick Warren. 
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life." 
And I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read. 
You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man. 
Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal. 
He's absolutely right. 
I give him an A+ on this. 
Yes. 
Al Gore, eat your heart out. 
This is a fantastic achievement. 
And the means -- how does he do it? 
I don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man. 
Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page. 
Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood. 
I really appreciated that. 
For instance, he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. 
The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted. 
Just enough repetition. 
That's really important. 
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain. 
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain. 
And now we come to my problem. 
Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. 
But I wish it were better. 
I have some problems with the book. 
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. 
I wish he could do this with a revision, a Mark 2 version of his book. 
"The truth will set you free." 
That's what it says in the Bible, and it's something that I want to live by, too. 
My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true. 
Now some of this is a difference of opinion. 
And that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning. 
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. 
There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth." 
Now, I just do not believe that. 
We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. 
But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion. 
That's not what I'm really worried about. 
How about this: "God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it." 
I am not happy with that sentiment at all. 
Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. 
And here, I think, "Wait a minute." I read this again. 
I read it three or four times and I think, "Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design? 
Is he endorsing creationism here?" 
And you can't tell. 
So I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet." 
I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false. 
Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way. 
I think that's false. 
Now, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. 
Here's another one: "For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts. 
Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second." 
There might be some way of treating that as true. 
"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge, hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being -- an inbuilt need to connect with God." 
Whose truth are we going to listen to? 
And here's one that does concern me. 
And that's a problem. 
He's better at arguing than you are, having had thousands of years to practice." 
Now, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. 
It's an old move. 
It's a very clever adaptation of religions. 
It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism. 
"You don't like my interpretation? 
You've got a reasonable objection to it? 
Don't listen, don't listen! 
That's the Devil speaking." 
This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. 
I've got one more problem, then I'm through. 
And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it. 
We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. 
Here's one, not as beautiful as the others; it simply shows the religions of the world. 
It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. 
I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently, in front of a church: "Good without God becomes zero." 
Sort of cute. 
A very clever little meme. 
If you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God. 
I wish this meme would go extinct. 
Thanks very much for your attention. 
But before I talk about the political chemistry, I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil. 
The napalm is burning there quite nicely. 
And the thing is, is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer. 
We're four percent of the world's population; we use 25 percent of the world's oil production. 
So this is what happens as that burn gets going. 
It takes off. It's a big woosh. 
It'll just bake your retinas. 
So there it is; the retinas are baking. 
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil. 
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. 
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. 
You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic. 
Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt. 
They're very important in oil spills. 
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. 
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous. 
Oil doesn't sink, it floats. 
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill. 
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water. 
It spreads out to be really thin, so you have a hard time corralling it. 
It also makes it very viscous. 
It's incredibly hard to clean up. 
And every single oil is different when it hits water. 
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics, it's absolutely explosive. 
For the first time, American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves. 
They have a "eureka!" moment, when we suddenly understand oil in a different context. 
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks, "Wow! I'm going to go buy some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work." 
No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas. 
I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off. 
They set the prices, and I don't even know. 
I am helpless over this." 
You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one, are designed to look like ATMs. 
And that's actually very perverse. 
This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles. 
It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness. 
"Now," you think, "why would something so lame work on people so smart?" 
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas, we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance. 
I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. 
We don't want to be buying oil; we want to be doing something green. 
And we get kind of in on our own con. 
I mean -- and this is funny, it looks funny here. 
But in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked. 
We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars. 
We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet. 
Okay, so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. 
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers. 
Early journalists looked at these spills, and they said, "This is a filthy industry." 
But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. 
They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground. 
It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically. 
But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing, long before it became funny. 
And then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller. 
And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy. 
But in many ways, that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us. 
There were no lips. 
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them." 
And then there's this guy, okay. 
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. 
So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction. 
But it makes for good theater, and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. 
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing. 
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill. 
You have these pictures of birds. 
They really influence people. 
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969, it formed the environmental movement in its modern form. 
It started Earth Day. 
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. 
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. 
Here we are normally; we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless. 
We look at these pictures and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain. 
We connect the dots in the supply chain. 
And we have this kind of -- as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment. 
This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important. 
But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it. 
We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem. 
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms. 
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive about what happened. 
And so what we did was, actually, we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling. 
We stopped drilling in ANWR, but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. 
In fact, it's continued to increase. 
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices. 
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf. 
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. 
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since 1969. 
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S., they might be actually here in this room. 
They have degrees in political science, degrees in business -- they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing. 
And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us. 
One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad, with Exxon. 
So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it; the World Bank, Exxon paid for it. 
We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem. 
I was there in 2003. 
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out, and we realized it was okay. 
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields. 
But at the same time, Chad has become much more unstable, and we are not paying for that price at the pump. 
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th. 
We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open. 
This is 1988 -- we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year. 
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump. 
We pay for it on April 15th, and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement. 
It's become this intense industrialized zone. 
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment. 
And finally, American families also pay a price for oil. 
They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care. 
And the same thing happens at the 50th percentile, around 80,000. 
So, what I'm going to talk to you about now is: what do we have to do this time? 
What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused? 
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater. 
We need to stay away from the moratoriums. 
We need to focus really back again on the molecules. 
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil. 
We need to focus on reducing the oil. 
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy. 
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount. 
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel. 
We actually encourage people to drive more. 
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies. 
We need to have more mobility choices. 
We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil. 
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing, and you can find more about this policy. 
They're up at NewAmerica.net. 
Now supposedly, oil taxes are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone. 
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. 
This is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now. 
So you're not helpless at the pump. 
That's a lot. 
And also, the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system. 
With this whole sort of suite of policies, we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent by 2020. 
So, three million barrels a day. 
Thank you. 
I want to introduce you to my badass friends. 
Meet Thelma and Louise. 
But more importantly, for Africa -- it's resultant childhood stunting. 
Nutritional stunting manifests itself in a reduction of growth rate in human development. 
And according to UNICEF, stunting doesn't come easy. 
It doesn't come quickly. 
It happens over a long period of time during which a child endures painful and debilitating cycles of illness, depressed appetite, insufficient nutrition and inadequate care. 
And most kids simply can't endure such rigors. 
But those that do survive, they carry forward long-term cognitive problems as well as losses of stature. 
The numbers of stunted children under the age of five, in most regions of the world, has been declining. 
And I really hate to say this, but the only place where they haven't been declining is here, in Africa. 
Essential amino acids are called essential because we can't synthesize them in our bodies. 
We have to get them from our foods and the best sources are animal-derived: milk, meat and eggs. 
Most protein consumed on the African continent is crop-based. 
And although we have millions of smallholder farmers rearing animals, livestock production is not as easy as we think. 
The big livestock gaps between rich countries and poor countries are due to poor animal health. 
This is a global pathogens network. 
And it shows those pathogens that share hosts. 
In a nutshell, we share pathogens, and thus diseases, with the species we live closest to: our livestock. 
And we call these zoonotic diseases. 
Recent reports show that the deadly dozen zoonotic diseases kill 2.2 million people and sicken 2.4 billion people annually. 
And Jimmy says, "The greatest burden of zoonoses falls on one billion poor livestock keepers." 
We totally underestimate the importance of our smallholder farmers. 
They stand at the frontline of zoonotic epidemics. 
They pretty much underpin our existence. 
And they need to know so much, yet most lack knowledge on livestock disease prevention and treatment. 
So how do they learn? 
Sounds pretty gloomy, doesn't it? 
But we're at an interesting point in Africa. 
We're changing that narrative using innovative solutions, riding across scalable technologies. 
Knowledge doesn't have to be expensive. 
My company developed an agricultural platform called iCow. 
We teach farmers best livestock practices using SMS over simple, low-end phones. 
The first increases in productivity, of course, are improved animal health. 
We use SMS because it is retentive. 
Farmers store their messages, they write them down in books, and in effect, we're drip-feeding agricultural manuals into the fields. 
We recognize that we are all part of the global food network: producers and consumers, you and me, and every farmer. 
This beautiful animal is an African-Asian Sahiwal crossed with a Dutch Fleckvieh. 
She's milkier than her Sahiwal mom, and she's sturdier and more resistant to disease than her Fleckvieh father. 
Farmers contribute their production data -- milking records, breeding records and feeding records -- to the ADGG platform. 
Customized data, customized responses all aimed at increasing productivity based on the potential on the ground. 
We're at a very interesting place in agriculture in Africa. 
By the end of this year, we'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions. 
Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee food security. 
Thank you. 
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us. 
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing. 
So quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university? 
Who studied some physics in university? 
Pretty good. And at school? 
Okay, lots of you. 
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy, or possibly some slightly disturbing memories. 
So, physics and marketing. 
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law: "The force equals mass times acceleration." 
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign. 
The marketing is, the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it. 
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures. 
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle? 
Getting a little more technical now. 
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it. 
The act of observation changes it. 
It's the same in marketing. 
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior. 
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year. 
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category. 
So luckily, the science -- no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier. 
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it. 
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water. 
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water. 
Think about Toyota. 
It was, for a long time, revered as the most reliable of cars, and then they had the big recall incident. 
And Tiger Woods, for a long time, the perfect brand ambassador. 
Well, you know the story. 
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand. 
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics. 
This says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase. 
The same is true of marketing. 
If we go back 20 years, the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand. 
But where we are today, things have changed. 
But then you lose control of it. 
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer, it's impossible to control where it goes. 
But while this may be unsettling for marketers, it's actually a good thing. 
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people. 
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force, which is ultimately good for your brand. 
So, the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law. 
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed. 
You can't fight it, so embrace it and find a way to work with it. 
Thank you. 
Martin Luther King did not say, "I have a nightmare," when he inspired the civil rights movements. 
He said, "I have a dream." 
And I have a dream. 
I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road." 
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking, but everything is desolate, everything is dead. 
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road. 
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future. 
For too long, we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen. 
We have focused on the worst-case scenario. 
We have focused on the problems. 
And we have not thought enough about the solutions. 
We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention. 
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism. 
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism, that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer. 
A deer freezes very, very still, poised to run away. 
People are freezing and running away because we're using fear. 
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is. 
What would it be like to be improving the human lot? 
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better. 
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough. 
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough. 
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations. 
But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff. 
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time. 
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff. 
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce. 
And actually, social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world. 
This is from a global survey. 
It's asking people, what do they want. 
Okay, they think money is slightly important. 
We all need to love and be loved in life. 
It's not nearly as important as health. 
We want to be healthy and live a full life. 
These seem to be natural human aspirations. 
Why are statisticians not measuring these? 
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that? 
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet. 
We all have one planet. We all have to share it. 
It is the ultimate scarce resource, the one planet that we share. 
And economics is very interested in scarcity. 
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome, it thinks in terms of efficiency. 
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck. 
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use. 
It is an efficiency measure. 
And probably the easiest way to show you that, is to show you this graph. 
More is bad. 
Running vertically upwards, is a measure called "happy life years." 
It's about the well-being of nations. 
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy. 
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations. 
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average. 
Now, there's a huge array of nations around that global average. 
They are the U.S.A., other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually. 
In Hobbesian terms, life is short and brutish there. 
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years. 
Malaria, HIV/AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. 
But now for the good news! 
This is an aspirational graph. 
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth. 
They're Latin American. 
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to. 
Maybe some of you have. 
Costa Rica. 
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years. 
That is longer than in the USA. 
They are the happiest place. 
What's going on there? 
What's happening in Costa Rica? 
We can look at some of the data. 
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources. 
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021. 
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949. 
And they invested in social programs -- health and education. 
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world. 
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they. 
They have the social connectedness. 
It might be Latin American. 
And the challenge, really, is to pull the global average up here. 
That's what we need to do. 
And then we're starting to create a happy planet. 
That's one way of looking at it. 
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends. 
It's actually not very long away. 
It's half a human lifetime away. 
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050. 
This is not the very distant future. 
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like. 
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual. 
That is changing our business. 
And the point is, we need to carry on increasing well-being. 
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce. 
None of us, I think, want human progress to stop. 
I think we want it to carry on. 
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing. 
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in. 
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing. 
They want to hold on to what they've got. 
And if we're going to engage them, I think that's what we've got to do. 
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. 
Human beings are very motivated by the "now." 
What would that look like for society? 
And why do I hear that? 
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday, or American used yesterday? 
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions? 
That's how you create a collective goal. 
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it. 
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being. 
At a personal level, we need these nudges too. 
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders. 
What are these for happiness? 
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier? 
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life? 
And the first of these is to connect, is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life. 
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy? 
Keep building them. 
The second one is be active. 
Being active is great for our positive mood. 
The third one is take notice. 
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge? 
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being. 
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course. 
Older people who keep learning and are curious, they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down. 
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based. 
It's more curiosity. 
Keep learning. 
And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities, but give. 
Our generosity, our altruism, our compassion, are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain. 
We feel good if we give. 
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning. 
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people. 
They don't have any carbon content. 
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied. 
And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth. 
Now, Martin Luther King, on the eve of his death, gave an incredible speech. 
I have been to the mountain top, and I have seen the Promised Land." 
Human beings want to be happy. 
Pave them with the five ways. 
We live on a human-dominated planet, putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth. 
This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you, it's also part of the good news. 
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability. 
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years. 
We've had the same, roughly, abilities that developed civilizations as we know it. 
This is the environmental conditions on the planet. 
Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability. 
A thousand years into this period, we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns. 
We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today. 
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture, we domesticate animals and plants. 
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it. 
The only phase, as we know it that can support humanity. 
This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale. 
Now, as a scientist, what's the evidence for this? 
Well, the evidence is, unfortunately, ample. 
It's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change. 
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level. 
Do we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems. 
Biodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing, unsustainable tourism, climate change. 
No scientist could predict that in 2007, suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold. 
The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover. 
And the drama is, of course, that when the system does this, the logic may change. 
In my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation. 
So we have to ask ourselves: are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state? 
You know, you don't want to stand there. 
In fact, you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing, at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold. 
In fact, there's a fence quite upstream of this threshold, beyond which you are in a danger zone. 
Now we to ask ourselves: which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene? 
These include, of course, climate. 
It may surprise you that it's not only climate. 
You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land, you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable. 
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries. 
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space, the quantified boundaries, as suggested by this analysis. 
In the '50s, we start branching out. 
We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s, actually, right after Rio. 
Now the question then is: how gloomy is this? 
Is then sustainable development utopia? 
Well, there's no science to suggest. 
The drama is, of course, is that 200 countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction. 
This is a new paradigm. 
We're not doing that at any scale on governance. 
But is it happening anywhere? 
Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level? 
Well, yes, in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer. 
The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story. 
Global change, beautification rack culture, overfishing and unsustainable tourism, all together placing this system in the realization of crisis. 
But again, a crisis, new partnerships, actors locally, transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning. 
So crisis leading into opportunities. 
Now, what about the future? 
Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge, which is feeding a world of nine billion people. 
It has to basically do this on current land. 
We cannot expand anymore, because it erodes the planetary boundaries. 
And we need a transformation. 
But even on the hard policy area we have innovations. 
We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time. 
And what shall we do? 
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy, but you can subsidize electricity to poor people. 
You get people out of poverty. 
So there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here, and we can list many, many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet. 
What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate?" 
and then backtrack innovations within that. 
But of course, the drama is, it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option. 
So, there is scientific evidence. 
They sort of say the harsh news, that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization. 
Thank you. 
TD: But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all, I could share with you a little story about myself. 
All of the plans for me were already made. 
TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me, I was living in eastern Tibet with my family. 
And when I was seven years old, all of a sudden, a search party arrived at my home. 
And these days, people ask me a lot, how did that feel. 
How did that feel when they came and whisked you away, and your lifestyle completely changed? 
And what I mostly say is that, at that time, it was a pretty interesting idea to me. 
I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with. 
I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment. 
And immediately, a lot of different responsibilities, in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me. 
I was separated, largely, from my family, including my mother and father. 
So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn't going to come true. 
I feel, still, a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land. 
TD: And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father, albeit infrequently. 
I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone. 
TD: So those were just a few remarks about my personal background. 
That's wonderful, but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside. 
So we spoke and we heard some about design this week. 
I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way. 
So it's an interesting paradox at play there. 
We have that information, but what often happens to us is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it. 
We don't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts. 
His Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk. 
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth, and people would ask me, why. 
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow." 
And to you, everyone, thank you very much. 
Hello, everyone. 
Sawubona. 
In South Africa, where I come from, "sawubona" is the Zulu word for "hello." 
So beautiful, imagine being greeted like that. 
But what does it take in the way we see ourselves? 
Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories that help us to thrive in an increasingly complex and fraught world? 
This crucial question has been at the center of my life's work. 
Because how we deal with our inner world drives everything. 
Every aspect of how we love, how we live, how we parent and how we lead. 
The conventional view of emotions as good or bad, positive or negative, is rigid. 
And rigidity in the face of complexity is toxic. 
We need greater levels of emotional agility for true resilience and thriving. 
My journey with this calling began not in the hallowed halls of a university, but in the messy, tender business of life. 
I grew up in the white suburbs of apartheid South Africa, a country and community committed to not seeing. 
To denial. 
It's denial that makes 50 years of racist legislation possible while people convince themselves that they are doing nothing wrong. 
My father died on a Friday. 
He was 42 years old and I was 15. 
My mother whispered to me to go and say goodbye to my father before I went to school. 
His eyes were closed, but he knew I was there. 
In his presence, I had always felt seen. 
I told him I loved him, said goodbye and headed off for my day. 
At school, I drifted from science to mathematics to history to biology, as my father slipped from the world. 
From May to July to September to November, I went about with my usual smile. 
I didn't drop a single grade. 
When asked how I was doing, I would shrug and say, "OK." 
I was praised for being strong. 
I was the master of being OK. 
But back home, we struggled -- my father hadn't been able to keep his small business going during his illness. 
And my mother, alone, was grieving the love of her life trying to raise three children, and the creditors were knocking. 
We felt, as a family, financially and emotionally ravaged. 
And I began to spiral down, isolated, fast. 
I started to use food to numb my pain. 
Binging and purging. 
Refusing to accept the full weight of my grief. 
No one knew, and in a culture that values relentless positivity, I thought that no one wanted to know. 
But one person did not buy into my story of triumph over grief. 
My eighth-grade English teacher fixed me with burning blue eyes as she handed out blank notebooks. 
She said, "Write what you're feeling. 
Tell the truth. 
Write like nobody's reading." 
And just like that, I was invited to show up authentically to my grief and pain. 
It was a simple act but nothing short of a revolution for me. 
It was this revolution that started in this blank notebook 30 years ago that shaped my life's work. 
The secret, silent correspondence with myself. 
Life's beauty is inseparable from its fragility. 
We are young until we are not. 
We walk down the streets sexy until one day we realize that we are unseen. 
We are healthy until a diagnosis brings us to our knees. 
The only certainty is uncertainty, and yet we are not navigating this frailty successfully or sustainably. 
The World Health Organization tells us that depression is now the single leading cause of disability globally -- outstripping cancer, outstripping heart disease. 
On the one hand we might obsessively brood on our feelings. 
Getting stuck inside our heads. 
Hooked on being right. 
Or victimized by our news feed. 
On the other, we might bottle our emotions, pushing them aside and permitting only those emotions deemed legitimate. 
Or actively try to push aside these feelings. 
Normal, natural emotions are now seen as good or bad. 
And being positive has become a new form of moral correctness. 
People with cancer are automatically told to just stay positive. 
Women, to stop being so angry. 
And the list goes on. 
It's a tyranny. 
It's a tyranny of positivity. 
And it's cruel. 
Unkind. 
And ineffective. 
And we do it to ourselves, and we do it to others. 
It's unsustainable. 
For individuals, for families, for societies. 
And as we watch the ice caps melt, it is unsustainable for our planet. 
Research on emotional suppression shows that when emotions are pushed aside or ignored, they get stronger. 
Psychologists call this amplification. 
Like that delicious chocolate cake in the refrigerator -- the more you try to ignore it ... 
You might think you're in control of unwanted emotions when you ignore them, but in fact they control you. 
Internal pain always comes out. 
Always. 
And who pays the price? 
We do. 
Our children, our colleagues, our communities. 
Now, don't get me wrong. 
I'm not anti-happiness. 
I like being happy. 
I'm a pretty happy person. 
I've had hundreds of people tell me what they don't want to feel. 
They say things like, "I don't want to try because I don't want to feel disappointed." 
Or, "I just want this feeling to go away." 
"I understand," I say to them. 
"But you have dead people's goals." 
Tough emotions are part of our contract with life. 
Discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful life. 
So, how do we begin to dismantle rigidity and embrace emotional agility? 
And instead started to open my heart to what I did feel. 
Pain. 
And grief. 
And loss. 
And regret. 
But emotional agility is more that just an acceptance of emotions. 
We also know that accuracy matters. 
In my own research, I found that words are essential. 
We often use quick and easy labels to describe our feelings. 
"I'm stressed" is the most common one I hear. 
When we label our emotions accurately, we are more able to discern the precise cause of our feelings. 
And what scientists call the readiness potential in our brain is activated, allowing us to take concrete steps. 
But not just any steps -- the right steps for us. 
Because our emotions are data. 
Our emotions contain flashing lights to things that we care about. 
We tend not to feel strong emotion to stuff that doesn't mean anything in our worlds. 
When we are open to the difficult emotions, we are able to generate responses that are values-aligned. 
But there's an important caveat. 
Emotions are data, they are not directives. 
We can show up to and mine our emotions for their values without needing to listen to them. 
So, what does this look like in practice? 
When you feel a strong, tough emotion, don't race for the emotional exits. 
Learn its contours, show up to the journal of your hearts. 
What is the emotion telling you? 
And try not to say "I am," as in, "I'm angry" or "I'm sad." 
When you say "I am" it makes you sound as if you are the emotion. 
Whereas you are you, and the emotion is a data source. 
These are essential skills for us, our families, our communities. 
They're also critical to the workplace. 
In my research, when I looked at what helps people to bring the best of themselves to work, I found a powerful key contributor: individualized consideration. 
When people are allowed to feel their emotional truth, engagement, creativity and innovation flourish in the organization. 
Diversity isn't just people, it's also what's inside people. 
Including diversity of emotion. 
The most agile, resilient individuals, teams, organizations, families, communities are built on an openness to the normal human emotions. 
It's this that allows us to say, "What is my emotion telling me?" 
"Which action will bring me towards my values?" 
"Which will take me away from my values?" 
When I was little, I would wake up at night terrified by the idea of death. 
My father would comfort me with soft pats and kisses. 
But he would never lie. 
"We all die, Susie," he would say. 
"It's normal to be scared." 
He didn't try to invent a buffer between me and reality. 
It took me a while to understand the power of how he guided me through those nights. 
What he showed me is that courage is not an absence of fear; courage is fear walking. 
Neither of us knew that in 10 short years, he would be gone. 
And that time for each of us is all too precious and all too brief. 
"Are you agile?" 
Let the moment be an unreserved "yes." 
A "yes" born of a lifelong correspondence with your own heart. 
And in seeing yourself. 
Sawubona. 
And thank you. 
There's something really incredible happening. 
So there's over a billion people who have no access to energy whatsoever across the world, 620 million of them here in Africa. 
It costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid. 
If you are going to wait for it, it takes about nine years, on average, and that feels like a lifetime when you're trying to make that happen. 
That's kind of unbelievable, and it's also unacceptable. 
So let's do something about it. 
The lightbulb comes from this idea that you have an energy system that's made up of the ideas of Tesla and the ideas of Thomas Edison. 
So to get to the appliances, you need to have power stations. 
But the amazing thing, in a way, is that there's a revolution happening in the villages and towns all around us here in East Africa. 
And the revolution is an echo of the cell phone revolution. 
It's wireless, and that revolution is about solar and it's about distributed solar. 
Photons are wireless, they fall on every rooftop, and they generate enough power to be sufficient for every household need. 
So that's an incredible thing. 
There's also a problem with it. 
So what a shame. 
But here's what's happening, and here's the opportunity that I think we should all get excited about. 
So the opportunity has come to convert some of that solar power, wireless power, into energy at the household level. 
And three things have happened at the same time. 
First, the costs of solar productivity have come down. 
So putting a panel on your roof and generating power from it, that cost has absolutely collapsed over the last 30 years, and it's gone down by 95 percent. 
Second, the appliance network. 
They give you 10 times the amount of light, and they last 30 times as long. 
We can pay them off over a daily or a weekly schedule. 
So this is an incredible change in the economy that's happening, and it's really opened up something very, very innovative. 
So I'm going to introduce you to a lady I met with last week. 
It may not look like it, but Susan is a representative of a $27 billion market. 
So Susan is a proud owner of a small solar system. 
She has four or five lights and a radio. 
It's fantastic, and she talks about it. 
She talks about her kids doing homework at night because she has light. 
I'm not sure what the kids feel about that. 
She's not scared of her own house at night, because it has light in it, and I thought that was amazing. 
So Susan does something that many customers of these companies that I talked about do, and she forces us to innovate. 
She challenges companies, saying, "I've got the radio and the lights. 
You know what? I'd like a TV. 
I'd like to entertain, educate me and my kids. 
And then I would like to have some hair clippers for my kids, you know, to cut my kids' hair, and I'd love to have a fridge. 
And she's coined something that the energy world is really hungry to do. 
The idea that she's coined is the energy ladder. 
It starts, again, with a lightbulb. Right? 
But then let's go up from there. 
And then let's go up again. 
And you start to ask yourself, "So where is this headed?" 
Is this headed here, where we can have distributed systems with the right infrastructure to provide power for our hospitals and our schools? 
And really how far can this go? 
And this is the mindset shift that I think is really exciting. 
How far can we go? 
Could it get up to here? 
You know, this is the conceptual design for one of the world's biggest factories, designed to be fully solar-powered and fully off grid. 
Maybe we can get that. 
They're retail companies, so they're taking products out to people in the connecting markets. 
And they're appliance companies, so they're developing extraordinary products that are very efficient and very cheap. 
So an extraordinary thing is happening out there that's worth recognizing. 
And where does it take us? 
From a governmental perspective, from a social perspective, it takes us out to two really big goals. 
We aspire towards energy access for everybody, and we aspire towards a fully-functioning low-carbon economy. 
And it's the ability to have powerful tools. 
And he puts it better than anyone I've ever heard it. 
So just listen to this. 
That's it. 
And everybody has that choice, and everybody knows when they want to switch it on or off, whether they want to sell access or whether they want to store it. 
That freedom getting back into the hands of the consumer, that would be the most exciting thing. 
Amar Inamdar: Brilliant, right? That was Martin, and he has a really wonderful turn of phrase, and what a sense of vision that he captures. 
So picture that for a moment: every household a proud producer as well as consumer of energy ... 
the ability to generate power, to share power, to sell power, all coming from your own generating asset sitting on your own property. 
And that's the democracy of energy. 
Thank you very much. 
Help us understand, what are the key roadblocks right now? 
Like, what could make this go faster? 
AI: So the first one, I think, is really the intermittency of solar power. 
So storage is really one. 
CA: And those prices are coming down. 
AI: And those prices are coming down very quickly. 
Second, the appliance set. 
So it needs to get more efficient, and it needs to get more diverse. 
We need to do more of the things we in Africa want to do with the appliance set. 
CA: DC appliances. 
AI: DC appliances, and I think there's a real opportunity there, Chris. 
So create this new system here. 
CA: And some of the companies themselves, I mean, there's plenty of demand there. 
What's holding them back from supplying that demand? 
I mean, some of them talk about, they would like to sell 10x what they can currently sell. 
And that's holding a lot of these companies back. 
CA: Well, it's incredibly exciting to picture what could happen here. 
In my mind, this might be the biggest leapfrog of them all. 
And thank you for all you're doing and for sharing that vision so powerfully. 
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal. 
For real -- you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. 
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? 
Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. 
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. 
Imagine their congratulations, and their high image of you. 
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud? 
Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity? 
The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. 
Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. 
Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work. 
The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. 
And then because you've felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. 
So they hold us to it. 
So, let's look at the proof. 
1926: Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this "substitution." 
1933: Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind. 
It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests. 
Everyone wrote down their personal goal. 
Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't. 
So if this is true, what can we do? 
Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal. 
So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say? 
This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta. 
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile, and it happens to be 3,000 years old. 
It also happens to be a relative of parsley. 
The project is part art and part science. 
There's an environmental component. 
What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi, living on the remote island of Yakushima. 
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project. 
It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project. 
So it was the slow churn, if you will. 
So I started researching, and to my surprise, this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences. 
Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. 
It was very primal and more remote than anything I'd ever experienced before. 
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences. 
And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail, so I was literally left to my own devices. 
But luckily, it worked out obviously, but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected. 
It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet. 
And then, of course, there's the lichens. 
These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years. 
I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective. 
And what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon. 
And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings," sounds ominous, it is. 
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus, killing certain species of trees in the forest. 
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo, but I do know the fungus is down there. 
And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree. 
So this strategy has served it pretty well -- it's 2,400 years old. 
And then from underground to underwater. 
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around 2,000 years old. 
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one. 
This is at about 60 feet or 18 meters, depth. 
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral. 
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it, though luckily, they lost interest before killing it. 
Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way of the recent oil spill. 
Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet. 
This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah, that is literally 80,000 years old. 
What looks like a forest is actually only one tree. 
Imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system. 
So what you have is one giant, interconnected, genetically identical individual that's been living for 80,000 years. 
It also happens to be male and, in theory immortal. 
This is the spruce Gran Picea, which at 9,550 years is a mere babe in the woods. 
The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection. 
As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain, the vegetation zone is actually changing. 
So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them. 
This is the Fortingall Yew -- no, I'm just kidding -- this is the Fortingall Yew. 
And aside from coral, the answer is no. 
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses? 
However, it died in the lab as they were determining its age. 
So that being said, it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild. 
And back to the yew here. 
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard; it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall. 
And now down to another part of the world. 
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees. 
And we saw a number of them, and this is most likely the oldest. 
It's around 2,000, and it's called the Sagole Baobab. 
And you know, I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests. 
They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves, and they also contain records of natural and human events. 
And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this. 
You can see that this one has names carved into its trunk, but it also records some natural events. 
So the Baobabs, as they get older, tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out. 
And this brings me to another favorite of mine -- I think, because it is just so unusual. 
And what's more, it's actually a tree. 
It's a primitive conifer. 
You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center. 
And it actually never sheds those leaves, so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. 
This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things. 
This is something called an underground forest. 
That way, when a fire roars through, it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed. 
The tree can easily recover. 
These also tend to grow clonally, the oldest of which is 13,000 years old. 
Back in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age. 
This is the clonal Creosote bush, which is around 12,000 years old. 
If you've been in the American West, you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous, but that being said, you see that this has this unique, circular form. 
And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape. 
And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system, making it one genetically identical individual. 
It also has a friend nearby -- well, I think they're friends. 
This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away, and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years. 
And you see it has that similar circular form. 
And there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it. 
In fact, this land is designated for recreational all-terrain vehicle use. 
So, now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet. 
This is Siberian Actinobacteria, which is between 400,000 and 600,000 years old. 
And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost, was this bacteria. 
But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing. 
And what that means is that it's not dormant -- it's actually been living and growing for half a million years. 
It's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things, because if the permafrost melts, it won't survive. 
This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things, so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world. 
The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed, and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to. 
You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica. 
I'm trying to travel there to find 5,000 year-old moss, which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula. 
They've survived for millennia in desert, in the permafrost, at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean. 
Thank you. 
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there. 
On top of that, those are the places from where trouble comes. 
I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. 
After this, we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see. 
They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time. 
They downloaded it from Disney.com, or one of these websites, 14 days after putting the computer in their village. 
At that point, I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer. 
So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months. 
Make yourself understood to the computer." 
So the children said, "How do we do that." 
And I said, "I don't know, actually." 
In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley. 
After that, I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own. 
And he couldn't travel, so I went over there. 
He said two interesting things, "A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be." 
And I was doing that in the field, so every time I would watch it and think of him. 
And when you've got interest, then you have education. 
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa. 
This is a 15 year-old boy. 
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?" 
And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean." 
They would, you know, throw it back at you. 
They'd say, "This is very boring." 
If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away, then they will show off with each other about what they can do. 
This is what these children are doing. 
They are trying to multiply, I think. 
And all over India, at the end of about two years, children were beginning to Google their homework. 
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth. 
I mean, if there's stuff on Google, why would you need to stuff it into your head? 
At that time, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. 
So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi." 
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds-worth of University money sitting in Delhi." 
So in 2006, I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle. 
I wanted to test the limits of the system. 
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India. 
I called in 26 children. 
They all came in there, and I told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer. 
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything. 
It's all in English, and I'm going. 
I came back after two months, and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet. 
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?" 
They said, "Yes, we did." 
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing." 
They said, "We look at it every day." 
So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?" 
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. 
Well, one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. 
And then that's her over there. 
Remember, they don't study English. 
I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?" 
and she says, "The neuron? The neuron," and then she looked and did this. 
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice. 
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent, which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances. 
But 30 percent is not a pass. 
So I found that they had a friend, a local accountant, a young girl, and they played football with her. 
I asked that girl, "Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass?" 
And she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject." 
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother." 
She said, "What's that?" 
I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. 
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic. 
The scores went up to 50, which is what the posh schools of New Delhi, with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. 
So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious. 
So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places, I came to the most remote place that I could think of. 
In Gateshead, I took 32 children and I started to fine-tune the method. 
I made them into groups of four. 
I said, "You make your own groups of four. 
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers." 
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall. 
"You can exchange groups. 
You can walk across to another group, if you don't like your group, etc. 
And I explained to them that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method. 
I gave them six GCSE questions. 
The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes. 
The worst, in 45. 
They used everything that they knew -- news groups, Google, Wikipedia, Ask Jeeves, etc. 
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?" 
I said, "Well, let's try it. 
I'll come back after two months. 
We'll give them a paper test -- no computers, no talking to each other, etc." 
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent. 
When I did the experiment, when I did the test, after two months, the score was 76 percent. 
There was photographic recall inside the children, I suspect because they're discussing with each other. 
A single child in front of a single computer will not do that. 
I have further results, which are almost unbelievable, of scores which go up with time. 
Because their teachers say that after the session is over, the children continue to Google further. 
Here in Britain, I put out a call for British grandmothers, after my Kuppam experiment. 
Well, you know, they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers. 
200 of them volunteered immediately. 
The granny cloud sits over there. 
I can beam them to whichever school I want to. 
You say it. 
You can't catch me. 
Children: You can't catch me. 
Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man. 
Children: I'm the gingerbread man. 
Teacher: Well done. Very good ... 
You know, stuff which I don't know anything about. 
Two children watch a TEDTalk. 
They wanted to be footballers before. 
After watching eight TEDTalks, he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. 
This is what I'm building now -- they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments. 
The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens, big broadband connections, but in groups. 
If they want, they can call the granny cloud. 
This is a SOLE in Newcastle. 
The mediator is from Pune, India. 
So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop. 
I went to Turin in May. 
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students. 
I speak only English, they speak only Italian, so we had no way to communicate. 
I started writing English questions on the blackboard. 
The children looked at it and said, "What?" 
I said, "Well, do it." 
They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian, went back into Italian Google. 
Fifteen minutes later -- next question: where is Calcutta? 
This one, they took only 10 minutes. 
I tried a really hard one then. 
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do? 
There was silence for a while, then they said, "You've spelled it wrong. 
It's Pitagora." 
And then, in 20 minutes, the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens. 
This sent shivers up my spine. 
These are 10 year-olds. 
Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then? 
I think we've just stumbled across a self-organizing system. 
A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside. 
Which is why you react the way you do, because it looks impossible. 
I think I can make a guess now -- education is self-organizing system, where learning is an emergent phenomenon. 
It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally, but I'm going to try. 
But in the meanwhile, there is a method available. 
We could change everything. 
Thanks. 
The moment I say "school," so many memories come back to me. 
It's like after every exam, when I walk out, the teacher would say, "Hey, come. 
How did you do?" 
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass." 
So it went on like that, and I didn't know where else to find myself. 
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting. 
And then school also started supporting me. 
"Oh, he's bad at studies, but let him send to the drawing competitions." 
So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school. 
And one of those competitions, I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio. 
And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home. 
So I just switched on in the train, loudly. 
If you travel in Indian trains, you can see people listening to radio and, you know, even from their mobiles. 
You know, like just adjacent to me. 
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?" 
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition." 
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts. 
I think you should study in a school of art. 
You just quit school and come there." 
It is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned. 
It can be ruins, or it can be music, or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is. 
But it is just a kind of trace of that time. 
And that fascinated me, to explore that territory. 
So I was working on the line, but instead of working about traces, I started capturing traces. 
So here are some of the works I would like to show you. 
It's just a trace of being in this body. 
It's almost like a 3D photograph. 
So it's almost like fossils for the future. 
And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces. 
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture thumbprint, footprint, or whatever traces we leave as humans." 
This is the trace of fire, this is the trace of sun. 
This is called "Dawn to Dawn." 
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper then put a coconut rope, and just burnt it. 
So it took about 24 hours to get this line. 
So wherever the fire is eating the paper, that's what becomes the work -- detail. 
So do we really understand what it is, or are we trying to get what we think it is? 
So like let's say even a simple act. 
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore? 
Can you just raise the hand? 
If you just ask an opinion of how, everyone can interpret it. 
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says, she'll simply say, "To get to the other side." 
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know. 
The answer can be so different if Potter said it. 
He would say, "For the greater good." 
It just all depends on one's perception. 
And context, what is really context? 
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper. 
Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist. 
The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist. 
It's just created by the mind. 
If you look at this piece of paper, this is the breadth and this is called length. 
This is how we've been taught in school. 
It's just that being a human, the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning. 
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark." 
It's just captured through from the lamp. 
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness. 
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that. 
This is called "Limit Out." 
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see? 
This is an exact negative. 
It's about six inches deep in the wall, but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall. 
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery. 
Again, "Inward Out." 
It's a full-figure cast from myself. 
It's about eight inches deep. 
Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art? 
I couldn't find it. 
It's called Odonil. 
This is the work I made out of that material. 
Will you help me to make this sculpture?" 
They never wrote back to me. 
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help." 
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company." 
They said, "Of course. 
This is the fee for the project report, and we will give you all the details," and they gave. 
Please come for the show." 
And they did. 
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi. 
In India, nobody really talks about works of art; they always talk about the appreciation of art. 
You buy this for 3,000 rupees, it'll become 30,000 in two months. 
This is the craft that was going on, but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate. 
And this was collected by Anupam -- which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything, because it will evaporate. 
So this is after a few weeks, this is after a few months. 
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions. 
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait," it may not be the portrait after a few months. 
And if they say it's solid, it will not be solid, it will evaporate. 
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum. 
So they inhaled it, but they are not aware of it. 
And I was like, "What do you mean?" 
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self. 
Don't you think it remained something about death," they said. 
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it. 
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor?" 
I said, "No, mom. It can't be. 
So, I did this work for her. 
It's called "Emerging Angel." 
This is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other. 
So, the same sculpture after a few days. 
This is after 15/20 days. 
Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood, the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one. 
This gave me a greater faith. 
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [the] invisible. 
So what you see now is called "Shadow Foreshadow." 
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist. 
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time. 
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it. 
The same thing in the darkroom. 
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light, and we realize the existence of light. 
So we don't see dark, we don't see light, we don't see gravity, we don't see electricity. 
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this, you know? 
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points. 
The skin of this is also representing this. 
And skin at the other end also represents the floor. 
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow. 
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow. 
Then the second one -- the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence. 
So that produced a shadow. 
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that. 
Then, again, that becomes an object. 
Again, throwing light, then the third one. 
So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow. 
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow. 
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished." 
You can see the detail. 
This is called "Gravity." 
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall. 
It's a false wall, which contains like 110 cubic feet. 
So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in. 
So where it's happening, we can see, but what is happening will remain invisible only. 
This is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery. 
This is called "Kaayam." 
Detail. 
We don't feel, "I am touching the air," but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it. 
So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses. 
So my request was like, is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign? 
And to really get to the point, we should move beyond, you know, go to the other side of the wall, like illogic, like are invisible. 
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint. 
Thank you. 
My story is a little bit about war. 
It's about disillusionment. 
It's about death. 
And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage. 
I don't believe in straightforward narratives. 
I'm colorblind. 
I was born unable to see most colors. 
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy. 
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside. 
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot. 
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot, and sure enough, I failed. 
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights, and I can't distinguish color. 
As a child, I read the newspaper thoroughly. 
in Angola or Afghanistan. 
These things really interested me. 
And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat. 
And he turned to me, and he said, "Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat." 
In 1989, I entered the British Foreign Service. 
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat, and 20 of us succeeded. 
And as those numbers suggest, I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world. 
Being a diplomat, then and now, is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it. 
I traveled to the Gaza Strip. 
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry. 
I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary. 
I met Yasser Arafat. 
I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N. 
Later, I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. 
And that was exciting -- that was fun. 
It was really interesting. 
And it's a great cadre of people, incredibly close-knit community of people. 
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out, was when I was posted to New York. 
And my responsibility was the Middle East, which was my specialty. 
I was the chief British negotiator on the subject, and I was steeped in the issue. 
And anyway, my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time. 
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy. 
We went through several wars during my time in New York. 
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times kind of experience. 
I lived the high-life. 
Although I worked very long hours, I lived in a penthouse in Union Square. 
I was a single British diplomat in New York City; you can imagine what that might have meant. 
I decided to take a sabbatical, in fact, at the New School, Bruce. 
I was exhausted, and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. 
And I decided to take some time out from work. 
The Foreign Office was very generous. 
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them, and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work. 
It was nice. 
And eventually, I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo, which was then under U.N. administration. 
But they were random things. 
And I testified to that inquiry in secret. 
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war, which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still. 
The third reason, I won't go into. 
But anyway, I gave that testimony, and that presented me with a crisis. 
What was I going to do? 
And so I was in crisis. 
And this wasn't a pretty thing. 
And it was like that for me. I love that movie. 
I felt just something's broken. 
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff. 
And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling. 
And I started to fall. 
And today, that fall hasn't stopped; I'm still falling. 
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it. 
A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me. 
A lot of my friends were still in it. 
My pension was in it. 
And I gave it up. 
And what was I going to do? 
And that year, in Kosovo, this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw. 
In March 2004, there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo. 
18 people were killed. 
It was anarchy. 
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it. 
And I went through it. I went through those mobs. 
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed. 
And that riot taught me something, which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story. 
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system, this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo, and the Kosovars weren't part of it. 
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that. 
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration. 
It wasn't the only reason, and life is not simple, one reason narratives. 
It was a complicated thing, and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was. 
But that was one of the reasons. 
And that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise, it gave my wife the inspiration. 
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars? 
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?" 
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service. 
They were not allowed diplomats. 
And so that was the idea. 
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat, the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot. 
And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo. 
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?" 
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said, "Yes, Carne. Come." 
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government. 
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo. 
And Kosovo became independent. 
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island. 
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations, which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen. 
At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York. 
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?" 
And watching ?What If! 
And Independent Diplomat, today, tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!. 
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office. 
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. 
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition, are having a difficult time, diplomatically. 
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. 
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today. 
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world, which is that the world is fragmenting. 
States mean less than they used to, and the power of the state is declining. 
That means the power of others things is rising. 
Those other things are called non-state actors. 
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world. 
Us. 
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it? 
We have no choice but to embrace that reality. 
I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia. 
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough, but that connection is there. 
We are all intimately connected. 
And this isn't just Tom Friedman, it's actually provable in case after case after case. 
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things, you have to look to yourself to do things. 
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way. 
The U.N. was established in 1945. 
Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict. 
That is the state of the world today. 
Something's got to be done about this. 
So I started off in a traditional mode. 
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council. 
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected. 
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think. 
It'll be great. You can have an exchange. 
Super-logical, you would think. 
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it. 
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right. 
Come back to us in maybe six months." 
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything. 
So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought, what can we do about it. 
So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves. 
So there's actually a conversation, which has never before happened. 
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran. 
That's my story. Thanks. 
I'm a voracious reader, a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer. 
I have read the Twilight tetralogy. 
And one who lives for my home theater, a home theater where I devour DVDs, video on demand and a lot of television. 
We now know, in fact, that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time. 
Five years ago, Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV, the majority on TV. 
Gen Yers spent even more -- 23.8 hours, the majority online. 
Moreover, we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption. 
These are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain. 
But as particular as they feel to us, we know we're not alone. 
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves, "Are we next?" 
Whatever we do together is pure invention. 
The maps they gave us are out of date by years." 
Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion, internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models. 
And at heart, both reformations, I think, were asking the questions: who's entitled to practice? 
How are they entitled to practice? 
And indeed, do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine? 
And now who in this room doesn't know a 14 year-old hard at work on her second, third, or fourth movie? 
Again, in the '30s, Warner Brothers, RKO did that for you. 
Now, go to YouTube, Facebook; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom. 
This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market, a time when anyone is a potential author. 
This group, others have called the pro-ams, amateur artists doing work at a professional level. 
You see them on YouTube, in dance competitions, film festivals and more. 
They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary, while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions. 
Ultimately, we now live in a world defined not by consumption, but by participation. 
They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity -- not opulence, of dignity. 
But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is, by far, too shortsighted. 
You know, we've said for a long time, we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town. 
God knows, if we ever needed that capacity in human history, we need it now. 
You know, we're bound together, not, I think by technology, entertainment and design, but by common cause. 
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come. 
And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon. 
We can't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way. 
So I'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean. 
We'll look at sea level rise. 
We'll look at ocean warming. 
What frightens you?"
