Mounting regional disparities, as well as the widening urban-rural divide, impede household consumption growth, increasing the economy’s dependence on exports and foreign investment. 
For years, as optimists see it, China has been the world’s cheap assembly shop for shoes, clothing, and microwave ovens. 
Now, it is laying the groundwork to become a global power in more sophisticated, technology-intensive industries. 
Billions of dollars are flowing into auto, steel, chemical, and high-tech electronics plants, setting the stage for China to be a major exporter of high-end products. 
While this argument suggests that the global trading system must make more room for a rising China (and India), it overlooks the need to address the enormous structural problems in China’s domestic sectors if export-led growth is to become sustainable. 
For these sectors, rapid investment-driven growth in the past decade has produced a mountain of excess capacity, reflected in stagnant prices and the banking sector’s soaring volume of bad loans, as price wars squeeze profitability and stimulate real-estate speculation. 
Postponing structural reforms eventually constrains any economy’s performance, as we saw in Japan in the 1980’s and 1990’s. 
China has similar problems, with the investment-growth nexus threatening macroeconomic stability – witness the overheating that occurred in 2003 and 2004. 
Indeed, China faces tremendous challenges in maintaining macroeconomic stability under conditions of export-led growth, with huge repercussions for the rest of the world. 
Given China’s size and its rising share in the global market, macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials. 
But the political reality is that China’s government favors rapid growth in the short run over the structural reforms needed to sustain long-term economic performance. 
Fiscal consolidation and the abrupt closure and restructuring of inefficient banks and state enterprises would, after all, constitute a powerful brake on short-term growth, threatening social peace and political stability. 
This may explain the growing efforts of Chinese businesses in recent years to go global themselves. 
Globalization is increasingly viewed as an alternative to domestic structural complexity. 
This strategy will exact a heavy price, just as it did in Japan twenty years ago. 
The main lesson of Japan’s approach is that launching an aggressive buying spree overseas merely upsets established international balances of interests – thus generating greater tensions with the rest of the world – while hiding the seriousness of structural problems at home. 
China has much to gain by avoiding such a strategy. 
Focusing squarely on structural reforms would allay some of the fears that China’s rise has inspired in the rest of the world, while winning praise from the international business community. 
Rather than scaring global corporations and their home states, China would retain strong political support abroad – and the financing that it needs for its continued development. 
In economic terms, China has no choice: it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two. 
Above all, truly secure and sustainable economic development requires that it build a large consumer base at home. 
Of course, the global imbalances associated with China’s economic rise can take longer to adjust than they otherwise would, simply because the US welcomes it as being in America’s own interest. 
But China’s long-term interest, and that of the world, requires that it get serious about domestic structural reform. 
The Soft Underbelly of Europe's "Hard Core" 
France and Germany used to see themselves as the European Union's "hard core," surrounded by concentric circles of less committed partners. 
Only the other four founding members of what was the European Community--Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg--were admitted into the innermost circle of Europe's true believers. 
No doubt, the post-WWII reconciliation between France and Germany--who once perceived and fought each other as "hereditary enemies"--has been the motor of European integration for half a century. 
Today, however, that Franco-German couple looks more like Europe's soft underbelly. 
The motor has turned into a brake. 
The traumatic experience of western disunity over Iraq in the UN Security Council--with the governments of Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder leading the resistance to the US/UK led invasion of Iraq--demonstrated that Franco-German bilateralism has destructive side effects. 
Their perceived claim to speak for Europe antagonized much of the Union. 
A European "hard core" is not an end in itself. 
Its raison d'être is to overcome national selfishness and to set a good example. 
If guided by the spirit of multilateralism, the Franco-German pair pulls Europe together. 
But this is precisely what France and Germany now refrain from doing in many fields of European integration. 
In October last year, Chirac and Schröder struck a deal on the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), ensuring that France will remain the biggest beneficiary of the farm budget after the EU takes in 10 new members in 2004. 
The CAP consumes about half of the Union's budget--an unimpressive symbol for a community that aims to become a player in world politics. 
Now, the agreement underpinning Europe's single currency, the euro, has come under Franco-German attack. 
Once again, the two countries have forged a "coalition of the unwilling"--this time against the sanctions mechanism of the European Stability and Growth Pact, which limits the size of euro members' budget deficits to 3% of GDP. 
The European Central Bank has indicated that the Pact's collapse could force up Euroland interest rates. 
In other words, countries complying with the Pact would now pay the bill for the lack of fiscal discipline in France and Germany. 
Germany's behavior is particularly galling, as it had been the strongest advocate of the Stability Pact. 
Under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, it gave up its beloved Deutsche Mark for the sake of deepening European integration, but also to sooth French fears that Germany was poised to establish monetary hegemony over the continent. 
France, in turn, had to swallow the Stability and Growth Pact to convince a reluctant German public that the euro would be as stable as the Deutsche Mark. 
Abiding by European rules should go without saying, even if that means adopting unpopular austerity measures at home. 
It is understandable that good Europeans like the Dutch and the Finns find it unacceptable that heavyweights like France and Germany now claim to be more equal than smaller countries. 
If the EU becomes used to that idea--beyond fair institutional arrangements that take into account demographic differences--the process of European unification will lose its legitimacy. 
What is at stake for Germany is not simply its reputation as a source of economic dynamism and an anchor of monetary stability within the EU. 
It may also be destroying the main pillar of its influence in international politics more broadly--that is, its ability to act as an "honest broker," to use Bismarck's famous phrase. 
The postwar architecture of German foreign policy has been made up of several bridges--to the United States, to France, to Britain, to smaller EU member states, to Central and Eastern Europe, and to Russia. 
The German way of diplomacy consisted of avoiding hard choices between Paris and Washington, Moscow and Warsaw, the EU and NATO, big neighbors and small ones. 
If a choice had to be made, Germany gave America priority over France. 
Gaullism, or the vision of a French-led European counterweight to the US, has never been an option for Germany. 
Neither, to be sure, has the Euro-skeptic British version of Atlanticism. 
For all German Chancellors from Konrad Adenauer to Helmut Kohl, France was the favorite European partner, but they refused to accept French offers to create a "Franco-German union" that would destroy the mediating character of German foreign policy. 
Tragically, the bridges to the US as well as to Central and Eastern Europe have been damaged by German diplomacy during the Iraq crisis, and the bridge to the smaller EU member states is now in the process of being damaged by the Teutonic colossus's noncompliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. 
As for the euro, the Germans have to accept that if they want to remain good Europeans, they have to get their own fiscal house in order. 
For whatever they do or refrain from doing in terms of domestic reforms affects their partners. 
As for the future of Europe's "hard core," such an idea only makes sense from a German perspective if it does not limit Germany's role as a moderator. 
The best solution for Europe would be an inner circle consisting of France, Germany, and Britain, at least. 
Together, these three countries represent the complete diversity of foreign policy traditions that one can find in the future 25-member EU. 
Trying to pool these traditions may look like trying to square a circle. 
But the alternative is a European Disunion that no one will take seriously as a player in world politics. 
That is an outcome that no true European believer in France and Germany should be prepared to countenance. 
The Software of Life 
Being alive, we tend to think that life is easy to grasp. 
In the accepted classification of sciences, mathematics is thought to be the queen, and the most difficult to grasp, followed by physics, chemistry, and, finally, biology. 
But this scientific hierarchy is false and misleading: we now know that biology contains more mathematics than we ever imagined. 
When molecules entered the scientific understanding of life with the discovery of DNA, biology climbed one step up the scale, to chemistry. 
Then, with recognition of the abstract schemas dictating how genes are expressed, biology climbed even closer to mathematics. 
Today’s buzzword in the study of life is “systems” biology. 
For a long time, those who studied the nature of life and heredity were divided into two camps: epigeneticists , who emphasized environmental influences on living organisms, and preformists , who stressed the similarities between parents and progeny. 
The epigeneticist view was clearly wrong, because something stable had to be transmitted across generations. 
But the preformist view that the entity transmitted across generations was the whole organism was contradicted by the impossibility of segmenting objects infinitely. 
What had to be transmitted was not the final organism, but the recipe to make it. 
Consider the old metaphysical puzzle: is a wooden boat whose planks are gradually replaced as they decay the same boat after all the planks have been changed? 
“Systems” biology is biology that recognizes that what remains the same is the design of the boat – that which determines the relationships between the planks. 
This thought paved the way for the concept of a “genetic program,” akin to a computer program – a metaphor that became almost self-evident when the structure of DNA was discovered, because DNA could be visualized as a linear string of symbols, which is exactly what computers read as a program. 
Like a computer program, DNA does not preserve the final state of what it codes for; rather, it embeds in a symbolic but concrete way (it is a real “text”) the relationships between all the objects and agents that it specifies and controls. 
A remarkable observation supports this analogy: viruses behave like individual pieces of programs, using the cell as the machine needed to make them multiply and subsequently propagate (often by destroying the machine). 
When computer programming became widespread, pieces of software were found to behave the same way, and were thus called “viruses.” 
And when it became possible to manipulate DNA in vitro, the metaphor of a “genetic program” appeared even more precise: scientists could construct experiments that corresponded to the reprogramming of cells merely by working on symbols in silicon. 
The metaphor comes from the famous mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, who, along with John von Neumann and other theoreticians, uncovered the link between the mathematics of whole numbers and logic. 
Turing proposed that all computations and logical operations could be performed by a simple machine, which he called the Universal Turing Machine, reading and modifying a linear sequence of symbols. 
This required only the physical separation of the symbols (visualized as a tape) handled by the machine and the machine itself. 
Moreover, the tape carried the data that allowed the machine to proceed. 
So the data could be split into two types: a program that embedded the “meaning” of the logical sequence recognized by the machine, and the pure data that provided the context for the program to run. 
Genetic engineering rests on the manipulation of DNA molecules (whether real or artificially constructed) in order to reprogram foreign cells. 
As a result, many bacteria today produce human proteins. 
But this represents only a small part of the genetic program. 
Transfer of genes between organisms is widespread. 
Nuclear cloning, illustrated by the sheep Dolly, has made the Universal Turing Machine a highly revealing, if not all explaining, model of the cell. 
If we take this metaphor at face value, there is a surprising consequence. 
It has been shown that, the outcome of some computer programs is at once entirely deterministic, innovative, and unpredictable. 
The computer metaphor thus implies that living organisms are material systems that, facing an unforeseeable future, arrive at improbable solutions so that some of their progeny can survive in unpredictable conditions. 
Life is inherently creative. 
However, the metaphor is limited by a simple fact: computers do not make computers. 
The challenge for the new biology is to understand how they would. 
The Solid but Regrettable Argument for Israel's Security Fence 
The International Court of Justice has completed its hearings on the legality of the barrier Israel is building in the occupied West Bank. 
This is an isolated question among many larger issues that await a negotiated peace agreement. 
Who has the right to what land? 
Do Palestinian refugees and their descendants have a right to go back to what is now Israel? 
Do Jews have a right to settle in the West Bank? 
Basic issues of justice -- such as the right of each side to live with dignity and security -- are, of course, important in any peace agreement. 
But most of them are interrelated, and it is unlikely that the ICJ can resolve them when they are truncated into technical arguments about where a defensive wall can or cannot go. 
Even so, now that the issue has been put before the Court, it must be discussed. 
Although the world expects a negative decision, Israel can in fact muster a sound legal case. 
If the fence followed the 1967 boundary there would be few objections. 
But, because it runs partly through the West Bank and protects not only people living in Israel, but also the settlers in the occupied territories, Israel stands accused of an illegal "land grab." 
The argument against the fence on the West Bank assumes that the settlers are there illegally and therefore are not entitled to the protection of a defensive barrier. 
As the Jordanians put it in their written submission, "no right of self‑defense. . . can be invoked in order to defend that which is itself unlawful." 
There is something clearly wrong with that argument. 
As a political matter, I oppose the settlements. 
Most, if not all, of them will have to come down in the ultimate compromise that will emerge someday. 
But the argument about legality is more complicated. 
To be sure, Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that an occupying government "shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies." 
But as the parallel language of "deport or transfer" suggests, the more plausible reading is that the letter of Article 49 applies only to forcible transfers, not to settlements that are voluntary. 
At least until recently, the international community assumed this to be the likely reading of Article 49 because, in drafting the crimes subject to prosecution in the International Criminal Court, the concept of transfer was expanded to include the Occupying Power's "direct and indirect transfer" of its population into occupied territories. 
This language, in force since July 2002, arguably applies to official Israeli policies aimed at promoting "indirect transfer" by providing financial incentives to voluntary settlers. 
Suppose that in this limited sense the settlements are unlawful. 
Does that mean that the settlers are sitting ducks who can be attacked with impunity and have no right to defend themselves? 
To say yes is to subscribe to a curious concept of collective responsibility. 
Even if some Israeli officials are guilty of a crime in encouraging settlements, does that mean that the settlers must be viewed as complicit? 
True, some made an ideological choice to colonize "Judea and Samaria," as they call it, but others are ordinary people seeking better housing and a better life for their families. 
Their motives are too diverse to be reduced to any single stereotype. 
Indeed, some settlements are more than 25 years old and many settlers are a second or third generation of people living in the region. 
Are they, as well as children brought there by their parents, collectively guilty just because some government officials might have violated the Rome Statute since July 2002? 
Further, even if the conduct of Israeli officials is judged to be illegal, and even if some settlers are willing tools of Israeli policy, civilian settlers cannot lose their right of self‑defense -- certainly not against terrorists who are violating international law by targeting innocent people both inside of Israel and in the occupied territories. 
The only way in which civilians could ever lose the right of self‑defense would be if they, as individuals, were engaged in actions threatening imminent harm to others. 
Whatever one thinks of the settlers, they, in their daily routine, are not engaged in a pattern of threatening to kill or assault anyone. 
So if the settlers have a right to self‑defense, is the fence an acceptable means of realizing that right? 
Although it imposes hardships on others, the fence is a plausible means of protection against suicide bombers. 
It is neither disproportionate nor excessive. 
The best argument that the Palestinians could make against the fence is to make it unnecessary by suppressing suicide bombings. 
Someday, Israel's adversaries will abandon their policy of homicidal self‑destruction. 
When they do, there will be a very good legal and moral case for the fence to come down. 
The legal case for the fence is solid but regrettable. The fence is not only a physical reminder of the divide between the area's peoples, but also a cause of suffering for innocent Palestinians who are cut off from their fields, their jobs, and their families. 
The fence assumes that they, as a people, are the source of the deadly threats to the settlers. 
Thus reigns the collectivist mentality that drives the unending feud between Jews and Palestinians. 
Not all Jews are guilty for the actions of a clique that might have violated international law. 
Nor should all Palestinians suffer as though they acted as a single entity, posing a collective terrorist threat. 
Only negotiations, not legal bickering, can put an end to this iniquity. 
The Sources of Chinese Conduct 
BEIJING – Six decades ago, the American diplomat George Kennan wrote an article, “The Sources of SovietConduct,” that galvanized American and world opinion, which soon hardened into the rigid postures of the Cold War. 
Today, given China’s decisive influence on the global economy, and its increasing ability to project military power, understanding the sources of Chinese conduct has become a central issue in international relations. 
Indeed, better understanding of China’s foreign policy motivations may help prevent relations between China and the United States from hardening into rigid and antagonistic postures. 
Since 2008, discussions among Chinese scholars and strategists on the nature of their country’s foreign policy have focused on two issues: its ideological foundations, and China’s international appeal and standing – its “soft power.” 
Mainstream thinking, known as the Chinese School, insists, with the government, on “Marxism with Chinese characteristics” as the bedrock principle of China’s foreign policy. 
But a minority school argues that China should rely instead on the country’s traditional political thought, emphasizing the universal value of traditional Chinese philosophy. 
While People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, consistently attacks that position, the Party itself has been rehabilitating Confucius, the central figure in Chinese traditional thought, going so far as to erect a statue of him in Tiananmen Square. 
The Chinese School insists on adhering to Deng Xiaoping’s doctrine of maintaining a low profile in international diplomacy, while the traditionalist group advocates taking on greater international responsibility. 
The mainstream school defines China as a developing country, pointing to China’s per capita GDP, which ranks only 104th in the world. 
The traditionalists argue that China should assume responsibility for world affairs consistent with its status as the world’s second-largest economy, behind only the US. 
Today, the impact of the Chinese School seems to be limited mostly to official statements, while the traditionalists are gradually gaining policy influence. 
For example, the Chinese government reiterated its core diplomatic principle of non-intervention in other countries’ affairs during the Libya crisis, yet China accepted the imposition of United Nations’ sanctions on Muammar Qaddafi’s government. 
Moreover, China dispatched a warship and four military aircraft to the Mediterranean to help evacuate 35,860 Chinese nationals and 2,100 others from Libya. 
That measure, the first projection of Chinese naval power so far from home, is consistent with Confucianism, which regards morality as the top priority of policymaking, rather than Marxism, according to which economic interests alone drive foreign policy. 
Early Confucian thinkers were writing in a world of small countries competing ruthlessly for territorial advantage. 
For them, the key to international power was political power, and the central attribute of political power was a morally informed leadership. 
Rulers, they believed, should act in accord with moral norms whenever possible. 
And the sphere of concern for any humane ruler should be the whole world, not just the people of one state. 
Thus, thinkers such as Mencius, Confucius’s leading intellectual heir, argued that humane authorities should punish immoral rulers in other states who tyrannize their people. 
Rulers who rely mostly on military or economic might divorced from morality, he argued, cannot achieve long-term success on the international stage. 
Although China is building Confucius Institutes across the globe, China’s traditional political philosophy does not often play decisive role in policymaking. 
China’s policy toward Libya, which differs significantly from previous policy, may or may not have been shaped by it; nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of it becoming the mainstream of thinking in Chinese foreign-policy circles in the near future. 
Indeed, Henry Kissinger once told me that he believes that Chinese traditional thought has a greater chance than any foreign ideology (say, Marxism or liberalism) of becoming the dominant intellectual force behind Chinese foreign policymaking. 
Domestic politics is always an important factor influencing a country’s foreign policy. 
At the recently concluded 11th People’s National Congress, the word heard most often in policy discussions was “happiness,” which had suddenly replaced “economic growth” as the official mantra. 
This change may augur future adjustments in China’s foreign policy as well, for “happiness” is a word used more frequently in Chinese traditional political thought than in Marxist political philosophy. 
According to early Confucian thinkers, a key task for rulers is to strive to improve a peoples’ happiness, which is itself grounded in a moral way of life. 
Because poverty was an obstacle to moral behavior, they believed that the state should be vitally concerned with eliminating it. 
The idea that the state should pursue economic growth without consideration for moral concerns was anathema to Confucius and his followers. 
In February 2010, at “Spring Festival” – one of China’s biggest holidays, marked by family reunions – Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said that the government should help people live with dignity and happiness. 
At a press conference this month, he said that economic reform cannot succeed without political reform, and that corruption currently poses the gravest danger to China. 
Such statements sounded new to Chinese ears, because they accentuated politics rather than trumpeting the Party’s usual emphasis on economic determinism. 
Today, it is impossible to tell what impact and how much influence Chinese traditional political thought – the traditional concern with moral duty, happiness, and honor – will have on China’s foreign policy. 
But it is certain that the influence of traditional ideas in Chinese public life is growing. 
Indeed, no force seems able to reverse this trend in the coming years. 
US Interest Rates Will Continue to Rise 
CAMBRIDGE – Six months ago, I wrote that long-term interest rates in the United States would rise, causing bond prices to fall by so much that an investor who owned ten-year Treasury bonds would lose more from the decline in the value of the bond than he would gain from the difference between the bonds’ interest rate and the interest rates on short-term money funds or bank deposits. 
That warning has already proved to be correct. 
The interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds has risen almost a full percentage point since February, to 2.72%, implying a loss of nearly 10% in the price of the bond. 
But what of the future? 
The recent rise in long-term interest rates is just the beginning of an increase that will punish investors who are seeking extra yield by betting on long-term bonds. 
Given the current expected inflation rate of 2%, the real rate on ten-year bonds is still less than 1%. 
Past experience implies that the real rate will rise to at least 2%, taking the total nominal interest rate to more than 4%, even if expected inflation remains at just 2%. 
The interest rate on long-term bonds has been kept abnormally low in the past few years by the Federal Reserve’s “unconventional monetary policy” of buying massive amounts of Treasury bonds and other long-term assets – so-called quantitative easing (QE) – and promising to keep short-term rates low for a considerable period. 
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s announcement in May that the Fed would soon start reducing its asset purchases and end QE in 2014 caused long-term interest rates to jump immediately. 
Although Bernanke’s announcement has focused markets on exactly when this “tapering” will begin and how rapidly it will proceed, these decisions will not affect the increased level of rates a year or two from now. 
The promise to keep the overnight interest rate low for an extended period was intended to persuade investors that they could achieve higher returns only by buying long-term securities, which would drive up these securities’ prices and drive down their yields. 
But the current version of this promise – not to raise the overnight interest rate until the unemployment rate drops below 6.5% – no longer implies that short-term rates will remain low for an “extended” period. 
With the unemployment rate currently at 7.4% – having fallen nearly a full percentage point in the last 12 months – markets can anticipate that the 6.5% threshold could be reached in 2014. 
And the prospect of rising short-term rates means that investors no longer need to hold long-term bonds to achieve a higher return over the next several years. 
Although it is difficult to anticipate how high long-term interest rates will eventually rise, the large budget deficit and the rising level of the national debt suggest that the real rate will be higher than 2%. 
A higher rate of expected inflation would also cause the total nominal rate to be greater than 5%. 
Today’s investors may not recall how much interest rates rose in recent decades. 
The interest rate on ten-year Treasuries increased from about 4% in the mid-1960’s to 8% in the mid-1970’s and 10% in the mid-1980’s. 
It was only at the end of the 1970’s that the Fed, under its new chairman, Paul Volcker, tightened monetary policy and caused inflation to fall. 
But, even after disinflation in the mid-1980’s, long-term interest rates remained relatively high. 
In 1985, the interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds was 10%, even though inflation had declined to less than 4%. 
The greatest risk to bond holders is that inflation will rise again, pushing up the interest rate on long-term bonds. 
History shows that rising inflation is eventually followed by higher nominal interest rates. 
It may therefore be tempting to invest in inflation-indexed bonds, which adjust both principal and interest payments to offset the effects of changes in price growth. 
But the protection against inflation does not prevent a loss of value if real interest rates rise, depressing the value of the bonds. 
The relatively low interest rates on both short-term and long-term bonds are now causing both individual investors and institutional fund managers to assume duration risk and credit-quality risk in the hope of achieving higher returns. 
That was the same risk strategy that preceded the financial crisis in 2008. 
Investors need to recognize that reaching for yield could end very badly yet again. 
The Specter of Global Stagflation 
New York – Will rising global inflation lead to a sharp global economic slowdown? 
Even worse, will it revive stagflation, that deadly combination of rising inflation and negative growth? 
Inflation is already rising in many advanced economies and emerging markets, and there are signs of likely economic contraction in many advanced economies (the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Japan). 
In emerging markets, inflation has – so far – been associated with growth, even economic overheating. 
But economic contraction in the US and other advanced economies may lead to a growth recoupling – rather than decoupling – in emerging markets, as the US contraction slows growth and rising inflation forces monetary authorities to tighten monetary and credit policies. 
They may then face “stagflation lite” – rising inflation tied to sharply slowing growth. 
Stagflation requires a negative supply-side shock that increases prices while simultaneously reducing output. 
Stagflationary shocks led to global recession three times in the last 35 years: in 1973-1975, when oil prices spiked following the Yom Kippur War and OPEC embargo; in 1979-1980, following the Iranian Revolution; and in 1990-91, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
Even the 2001 recession – mostly triggered by the bursting high-tech bubble – was accompanied by a doubling of oil prices, following the start of the second Palestinian intifada against Israel. 
Today, a stagflationary shock may result from an Israeli attack against Iran’s nuclear facilities. 
This geopolitical risk mounted in recent weeks as Israel has grown alarmed about Iran’s intentions. 
Such an attack would trigger sharp increases in oil prices – to well above $200 a barrel. 
The consequences of such a spike would be a major global recession, such as those of 1973, 1979, and 1990. 
Indeed, the most recent rise in oil prices is partly due to the increase in this fear premium. 
But short of such a negative supply-side shock, is global stagflation possible? 
Between 2004-2006 global growth was robust while inflation was low, owing to a positive global supply shock – the increase in productivity and productive capacity of China, India and emerging markets. 
This positive supply-side shock was followed – starting in 2006 – by a positive global demand shock: fast growth in “Chindia” and other emerging markets started to put pressure on the prices of a variety of commodities. 
Strong global growth in 2007 marked the beginning of a rise in global inflation, a phenomenon that, with some caveats (the sharp slowdown in the US and some advanced economies), continued into 2008. 
Barring a true negative supply-side shock, global stagflation is thus unlikely. 
Recent rises in oil, energy and other commodity prices reflect a variety of factors: 
Most of these factors are akin to positive global aggregate demand shocks, which should lead to economic overheating and a rise in global inflation. 
Exchange rate policies are key. 
Large current-account surpluses and/or rising terms of trade imply that the equilibrium real exchange rate (the relative price of foreign to domestic goods) has appreciated in countries like China and Russia. 
Thus, over time the actual real exchange rate needs to converge – via real appreciation – with the stronger equilibrium rate. 
If the nominal exchange rate is not permitted to appreciate, real appreciation can occur only through an increase in domestic inflation. 
So the most important way to control inflation – while regaining the monetary and credit policy autonomy needed to control inflation – is to allow currencies in these economies to appreciate significantly. 
Unfortunately, the need for currency appreciation and monetary tightening in overheated emerging markets comes at a time when the housing bust, credit crunch, and high oil prices are leading to a sharp slowdown in advanced economies – and outright recession in some of them. 
The world has come full circle. 
Following a benign period of a positive global supply shock, a positive global demand shock has led to global overheating and rising inflationary pressures. 
Now the worries are about a stagflationary supply shock – say, a war with Iran – coupled with a deflationary demand shock as housing bubbles go bust. 
Deflationary pressure could take hold in economies that are contracting, while inflationary pressures increase in economies that are still growing fast. 
Thus, central banks in many advanced and emerging economies are facing a nightmare scenario, in which they simultaneously must tighten monetary policy (to fight inflation) and ease it (to reduce the downside risks to growth). 
The Spires of Renewal 
PRAGUE - A dominant feature of Prague is the Gothic tower of the Cathedral of St. Vitus, St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert. 
That tower is now wrapped in scaffolding because – for the first time ever and, so to speak, at the eleventh hour – it is being renovated. 
Temporarily, the scaffold conceals the tower’s beauty. 
That concealment, however, is designed to preserve this beauty forever. 
Perhaps this scaffolding serves as an analogy for all postcommunist countries. 
If some of our best features are not quite visible for the time being, it is because our societies are covered by scaffolding as they undergo reconstruction, striving anew – this time in complete freedom – to rediscover and restore our true identities. 
Perhaps this analogy should also be applied even more generally, in the hope that, behind some of the unsightly features of today's world, seeds of an endeavor to save, preserve and creatively develop the values offered to us by the history of nature and the human race can be found. 
An unprecedented feature of our global civilization is that it is basically atheistic, notwithstanding the billions of people who profess, whether actively or passively, to believe in a religion. 
Indeed, the underlying values of our global civilization rarely, if ever, relate to eternity, to the infinite and absolute. 
Everywhere there is a decline in concern for that which will come after us, and for the common interest. 
Humanity depletes non-renewable natural resources and interferes with the planet’s climate. 
Humanity becomes estranged from itself by gradually liquidating appreciable human communities and human proportions. 
Humanity tolerates a cult of material gain as the highest value to which all must yield and before which even the democratic will must sometimes fall to its knees. 
Creating wealth, indeed, has ceased to correspond with creating real and meaningful values. 
This denaturing of the spirit means that our civilization is wrought with paradoxes. 
It is opened to possibilities that, until recently, were mere fairy-tales. 
On the other hand, it holds only a limited ability to avert developments that infuse these possibilities with danger, or result in outright abuse. 
Our civilization, for example, is pressured toward uniformity, but the fact that we are drawn ever closer to one another gives rise to an urge to emphasize our otherness, which can grow into callous ethnic or religious fanaticism. 
New sophisticated types of criminal activities, organized crime and terrorism, are emerging. 
Corruption flourishes. 
The gap between rich and poor grows deeper, and while people die of starvation in some parts of the world, other places see waste as a type of social obligation. 
Various government and non-governmental organizations attempt, of course, to resolve these problems. 
Yet I am afraid that the measures undertaken will not lead to any reversal unless something changes in the root thinking from which contemporary human behavior grows. 
For example, we often hear about the need to restructure the economies of poor countries, about wealthier nations being duty-bound to help in this. 
But it is even more important that we begin to think about another restructuring, a restructuring of the system of values that forms the basis of today’s civilization. 
This is of greatest urgency for those who are better off in material terms. 
The course of today's global civilization, indeed, has been determined by the wealthiest and most advanced nations. 
For this reason, they cannot be relieved of the necessity to engage in a critical reflection. 
We know that it is possible to devise ingenious regulatory instruments to protect the Earth’s climate, non-renewable resources, and biological diversity; to find ways to ensure that resources are used accountably at the places of their origin and that cultural identities and a human dimensions for development is maintained. 
Many people and institutions are actively working toward this end. 
But the crucial task now being neglected involves strengthening a system of universally shared moral standards that will make it impossible, on a truly global scale, for rules to be circumvented time and again. 
Only universal moral standards can generate natural respect for the rules we develop. 
Actions which jeopardize humanity’s future should not only be punishable but regarded as disgraceful. 
This will not happen unless we all find, within ourselves, the courage to forge an order of values that, despite all the world’s diversity, can be jointly embraced and jointly respected. 
This will not happen unless we relate these values to something that lies beyond the horizon of our immediate personal or group interest. 
How can this be achieved without a new and powerful advance in human spirituality? 
What can be done to encourage such an advance? 
Whatever our convictions, we are all threatened by our shortsightedness. 
None of us can escape our common destiny. 
Given this, we have only one possibility: to search inside ourselves as well as around us, for a sense of responsibility for the world; for mutual understanding and solidarity; for humility before the miracle of Being; for the ability to restrain ourselves in the general interest and to perform good deeds even if they remain unseen and unrecognized. 
Allow me to return to the Cathedral of Saint Vitus, St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert. 
Why, in bygone ages, did people construct so costly an edifice, one with little use by today's standards? 
One explanation is that there were periods in history when material gain was not the highest value; when humanity knew that there were mysteries never to be understood, and before which people could only stand in humble amazement and perhaps project that amazement into structures whose spires point upwards. 
Upwards to be seen far and wide, highlighting to everyone that which is worth looking up to. 
Upwards, across the borders of ages. 
Upwards, to that which is beyond our sight – that which, by its silent existence, precludes -- for all of us -- any right to treat the world as an endless source of short-term profit and which calls for solidarity with all who dwell under its mysterious vault. 
To begin to address some of the world’s deepest problems, we too must lift our eyes upwards as we bow our heads in humility. 
The Spirit of September 12 
WASHINGTON, DC – The terrorist attacks on the United States ten years ago provoked a powerful reaction: the dispatch of American troops, first to Afghanistan and then to Iraq, and the creation of a sprawling new federal agency, the Department of Homeland Security, to coordinate and supervise measures and programs aimed at protecting the US from further assaults. 
This expensive, intensive effort – known as the “global war on terror” – can be counted as a success, a diversion, and an example. 
The most important fact about the last decade is that, since 9/11, there has been no successful foreign terrorist attack in the US. 
For that, US government efforts deserve credit. 
No doubt a good deal of the money spent to make the US safe has been wasted. 
And the group that launched the initial attacks, Al Qaeda, never posed the kind of massive threat that America’s great Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union, once did. 
Still, it was clear in the wake of September 11 that a small number of people, motivated by a radical form of Islam, was determined to inflict as much harm on America and Americans as they could. 
Had they managed even a few more attacks similar to the ones on New York and Washington, they could have done serious damage. 
At worst, the US might have become a more closed, suspicious country, retreating from the openness that has been its hallmark. 
Fortunately, they failed, surely in part because the American government, in cooperation with other governments, worked hard to thwart them, killing and capturing some and discouraging others. 
In terms both of money and bureaucratic procedures – carefully scrutinizing all airline passengers, for example – Americans may have overpaid for a decade of avoiding terrorist attacks. 
But overpaying was far preferable to suffering more attacks. 
The highest cost of the war on terror has come not from what the US did over the last decade, but from what it failed to do. 
As Thomas L. Friedman and I write in our new book That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, America’s future depends on meeting four major challenges: globalization, the revolution in information technology, America’s rapidly growing deficits and debt, and its pattern of energy usage. 
Failure to deal effectively with these challenges will lower America’s rate of economic growth, thereby blocking generational upward mobility and undercutting the basis of US global influence. 
Over the last ten years, the US has not successfully addressed these four challenges. 
There are several reasons for this, but prominent among them is America’s decade-long focus on the threat of terrorism. 
While necessary in some form to protect the country, the war on terror as it played out has served to divert America’s attention and resources from the problems that it must solve in order to ensure its future prosperity and power. 
The most pressing of these problems is the condition of the education system, which does not adequately prepare young Americans for the jobs available in an economy transformed by globalization and information technology. 
Moreover, while over-investing in airport security and in nation-building in the Hindu Kush and Mesopotamia, the US underinvested in the roads, bridges, laboratories, and scientists that it needs for economic growth. 
To meet its major challenges, America will have to cut major government programs on which many people rely – the two programs that affect older Americans, Social Security and Medicare, in particular – and increase revenue by raising some taxes. 
At the same time, America will need to invest in domestic infrastructure and research and development, which are key to innovation and economic growth. 
The formula of cutting, taxing, and investing is not a popular one in America’s current political climate, and can be implemented only through the emergence of a broadly shared sense of sacrifice and purpose. 
The terrorist attacks ten years ago created just such a political climate. 
They produced the kind of resolve that will be required in the years ahead to address the equally important tasks that the US now faces. 
In the decade to come, the US must remain vigilant in order to prevent the kind of attacks that took place on September 11. 
The Spring of the Zombies 
New York – As spring comes to America, optimists are seeing “green sprouts” of recovery from the financial crisis and recession. 
The world is far different from what it was last spring, when the Bush administration was once again claiming to see “light at the end of the tunnel.” 
The metaphors and the administrations have changed, but not, it seems, the optimism. 
The good news is that we may be at the end of a free fall. 
The rate of economic decline has slowed. 
The bottom may be near – perhaps by the end of the year. 
But that does not mean that the global economy is set for a robust recovery any time soon. 
Hitting bottom is no reason to abandon the strong measures that have been taken to revive the global economy. 
This downturn is complex: an economic crisis combined with a financial crisis. 
Before its onset, America’s debt-ridden consumers were the engine of global growth. 
That model has broken down, and will not be replaced soon. 
For, even if America’s banks were healthy, household wealth has been devastated, and Americans were borrowing and consuming on the assumption that house prices would rise forever. 
The collapse of credit made matters worse; and firms, facing high borrowing costs and declining markets, responded quickly, cutting back inventories. 
Orders dropped abruptly – well out of proportion to the decline in GDP – and those countries that depended on investment goods and durables (expenditures that could be postponed) were particularly hard hit. 
We are likely to see a recovery in some of these areas from the bottoms reached at the end of 2008 and the beginning of this year. 
But examine the fundamentals: in America, real estate prices continue to fall, millions of homes are underwater, with the value of mortgages exceeding the market price, and unemployment is increasing, with hundreds of thousands reaching the end of their 39 weeks of unemployment insurance. 
States are being forced to lay off workers as tax revenues plummet. 
The banking system has just been tested to see if it is adequately capitalized – a “stress” test that involved no stress – and some couldn’t pass muster. 
But, rather than welcoming the opportunity to recapitalize, perhaps with government help, the banks seem to prefer a Japanese-style response: we will muddle through. 
Repeating the Savings ampamp; Loan debacle of the 1980’s. the banks are using bad accounting (they were allowed, for example, to keep impaired assets on their books without writing them down, on the fiction that they might be held to maturity and somehow turn healthy). 
Worse still, they are being allowed to borrow cheaply from the United States Federal Reserve, on the basis of poor collateral, and simultaneously to take risky positions. 
Some of the banks did report earnings in the first quarter of this year, mostly based on accounting legerdemain and trading profits (read: speculation). 
But thiswon’t get the economy going again quickly. 
And, if the bets don’t pay off, the cost to the American taxpayer will be even larger. 
The American government, too, is betting on muddling through: the Fed’s measures and government guarantees mean that banks have access to low-cost funds, and lending rates are high. 
If nothing nasty happens – losses on mortgages, commercial real estate, business loans, and credit cards – the banks might just be able to make it through without another crisis. 
In a few years time, the banks will be recapitalized, and the economy will return to normal. 
This is the rosy scenario. 
But experiences around the world suggest that this is a risky outlook. 
Even were banks healthy, the deleveraging process and the associated loss of wealth means that, more likely than not, the economy will be weak. 
And a weak economy means, more likely than not, more bank losses. 
The problems are not limited to the US. 
Other countries (like Spain) have their own real estate crises. 
Eastern Europe has its problems, which are likely to impact Western Europe’s highly leveraged banks. 
In a globalized world, problems in one part of the system quickly reverberate elsewhere. 
In earlier crises, as in East Asia a decade ago, recovery was quick, because the affected countries could export their way to renewed prosperity. 
But this is a synchronous global downturn. 
America and Europe can’t export their way out of their doldrums. 
Fixing the financial system is necessary, but not sufficient, for recovery. 
America’s strategy for fixing its financial system is costly and unfair, for it is rewarding the people who caused the economic mess. 
But there is an alternative that essentially means playing by the rules of a normal market economy: a debt-for-equity swap. 
With such a swap, confidence could be restored to the banking system, and lending could be reignited with little or no cost to the taxpayer. 
It’s neither particularly complicated nor novel. 
Bondholders obviously don’t like it – they would rather get a gift from the government. 
But there are far better uses of the public’s money, including another round of stimulus. 
Every downturn comes to an end. 
The question is how long and deep this downturn will be. 
In spite of some spring sprouts, we should prepare for another dark winter: it’s time for Plan B in bank restructuring and another dose of Keynesian medicine. 
The State of the World 
NEW YORK – We all recognize today’s perils. 
A global financial crisis. 
A global energy crisis. 
A global food crisis. 
Trade talks have collapsed, yet again. 
There are new outbreaks of war and violence. 
Climate change ever more clearly threatens our planet. 
We say that global problems demand global solutions. 
And yet, do we act? 
In truth, today, we also face a crisis of a different sort – the challenge of global leadership. 
New centers of power and leadership are emerging – in Asia, Latin America and across the newly developed world. 
In this new world, the challenges are increasingly those of collaboration, not confrontation. 
Nations can no longer protect their interests, or advance the well-being of their people, without the partnership of the rest. 
Yet I see a danger of nations looking inward rather than toward a shared future. 
I see a danger of retreating from the progress we have made, particularly in the realm of economic development and fairness in sharing the fruits of global growth. 
Yes, global growth has raised billions of people out of poverty. Yet if you are among the world’s poor, you have never felt poverty so sharply. 
Yes, international law and justice have never been so widely embraced. Yet those living in nations where human rights are abused have never been so vulnerable. 
Yes, most of us live in peace and security. Yet violence is deepening in many nations: Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, and Sudan. 
Their problems are part of the development emergency we face. 
Over the past year, the price of fuel, food, and commodities rose alarmingly. 
Wealthy countries worry about recession, while the poor can no longer afford to eat. 
The Millennium Development Goals are part of the solution. 
But progress here has been uneven. 
Pledges have not been honored. 
Yet we have achieved enough to know that the goals are within reach. 
The United Nations is the champion of the most vulnerable. 
When disaster strikes, we act. We did so this year in Haiti and other Caribbean nations hit by hurricanes. 
We did so after Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, where the challenge now is to push for political progress, including credible steps on human rights and democracy. 
We have helped people affected by severe flooding in Southeast Asia, and by drought in the Horn of Africa, where 14 million need emergency help. 
Since taking office, I have called for more strenuous action in Somalia. 
Must we wait – and see more children die in the sand? 
The global food crisis will not go away by itself. 
It may now have faded from the headlines. 
Last year at this time, rice cost $330 a ton. 
Today it is $730. 
People who used to buy rice by the bag now do so by the handful. 
Those who ate two meals a day now get by on one. 
The UN has focused on getting seeds and fertilizers into the hands of small farmers. 
We seek a new “green revolution” in Africa. 
But we lack new resources. 
The international community has not matched words with deeds. 
In Burundi and Sierra Leone, Liberia and Timor Leste, our resources are under strain because UN peacekeepers are helping nations turn the corner to peace. 
Yet the UN’s preventive diplomacy is often critical. 
We see the fruits in Nepal, Kenya and, we hope, Zimbabwe. 
Likewise, there is a real chance to reunify Cyprus. 
In Georgia, the UN can help ease the tensions resulting from the recent conflict. 
In Cote d’Ivoire, we will help organize elections before year’s end – a major stride toward recovery and democracy. 
But it is dangerous to think that the UN can address today’s complex problems without the full backing of its member states. 
In Darfur, for example, we face a continuing challenge in meeting deployment deadlines. 
We lack critical assets and personnel. 
If not matched by resources, mandates are empty. 
And now all of our work – financing for development, social spending in rich nations and poor, the Millennium Development Goals, peacekeeping – is endangered by the global financial crisis. 
We need to restore order to international financial markets. 
We must think about a new global economic order that more fully reflects the changing realities of our time. 
Those realities call for continuous UN action on countless fronts: combating malaria and AIDS, reducing maternal and child mortality, fighting global terrorism, and ensuring nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
On the Korean Peninsula, all the agreements of the six-party talks must be implemented, and Iran must comply with Security Council resolutions and cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
The area of human rights, above all, demands our vigilance. 
Justice must be treated as a pillar of peace, security, and development. 
We must advance the “responsibility to protect.” 
Despite the real political difficulties, we cannot let crimes against humanity go unpunished. 
Climate change remains the defining issue of our era. 
We must regain our momentum. 
Our first test comes in three months in Poznan, Poland. 
By then, we need a shared vision of a new global climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012. 
The foundation of all the UN’s work is accountability. 
We need to change the UN’s culture. 
We must become faster, more flexible, and more effective – more modern. 
We must replace our current system of contracts and conditions of service, which are dysfunctional and demoralizing. 
But the UN’s Member States must be accountable as well. 
Resolutions mandating peace operations cannot continue to be passed without the necessary troops, money, and materiel. 
We cannot send brave UN staff – 25 of whom died this year – around the world without assuring their security. 
We cannot reform this organization without the required resources. 
Today’s uncertainties will pass, but only if we act wisely and responsibly. 
By doing so, we will set the stage for a new era of stability and global prosperity, more widely and equitably shared. 
The Stealth Threat to World Trade 
Threats to world trade come in many guises. 
The usual suspects include protectionist barriers and militant anti-globalization protests of the type that derailed the “Millennium Round” of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Seattle last year. 
Although these protests grab headlines, a new and perhaps even more insidious threat to world trade has quietly taken shape over recent years: so called “open sectoralism,” or the practice of negotiating access to foreign markets on a selective, industry-by-industry basis. 
What this practice entails is that countries negotiate lower tariffs on some types of products but not on others. 
Contrary to appearances, open sectoralism is not a first step to more comprehensive trade agreements. 
Indeed, it may prevent wider agreements from being negotiated. 
For even when successfully negotiated, sectoral agreements jeopardize economic efficiency and performance by protecting the least competitive industries because each country tries to open trade in areas where it is competitive. 
No country likes to open its manufacturing dinosaurs to foreign competition. 
The economic implications of such a stance, however, are perverse. 
Imagine an America or Europe still stuck in the 1950s, with economies dependent on coal and steel, and textiles, and with no competition from cheaper producers in Asia and elsewhere, and the danger becomes obvious. 
A second danger arises from the fact that, by liberalizing trade for only a few economically successful industries, open sectoralism weakens, rather than strengthens, the broad political support needed for the comprehensive global trade agreements that benefit most businesses, consumers, and countries. 
America is the keenest supporter of open sectoralism, beginning several years ago with the “zero-for-zero” tariff negotiations during the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 
Those talks led ultimately to the dismantling of tariff barriers in ten key sectors. 
Pushed by business, the US negotiated sectoral agreements in telecoms, information technology, and financial services. 
The first major deal, the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), took effect in 1997 and covers 90% of trade in IT products worth more than $600 billion annually. 
The ITA was subsequently backed by the European Union after Hugo Paemen, the EU ambassador to the US, saw the ITA as proof that sectoral agreements help circumvent mounting political resistance to new trade rounds. 
With the support of the two most powerful actors in world trade, the ITA model has been pursued ever since in other sectors. 
A Global Agreement on Basic Telecommunications went into effect in 1998; a Financial Services Agreement to liberalize trade in banking, insurance, and securities was implemented in April 1999. 
Such agreements, which often dismantle not only tariffs but other regulatory barriers, may appear unassailable. 
But looks deceive. 
Because the powerful sectoral interests that supported liberalization during the Uruguay Round – information technology, financial services, telecommunications – now have their own deals, the energy they once brought to the cause of broader trade liberalization has diminished sharply. 
Indeed, the Japanese believe that the halfhearted backing of US business groups for a new round of WTO talks reflects the success of the earlier sectoral agreements. 
So Japan now opposes negotiating a second ITA, which it fears will further weaken political support for broad trade liberalization. 
Fears for the future of comprehensive, multi-sector trade negotiations are well founded. 
Continuing effort by US officials, for example, to focus narrowly on trade in services and agriculture impedes wider agreements by limiting the tradeoffs that can be made among sectors. 
Moreover, a sector-by-sector approach invariably ignores a host of issues within the WTO, such as dispute settlement, anti-dumping, and the like. 
The recent experience of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum highlights the limitations of open sectoralism and should prompt a thorough re-appraisal. 
Following the launch of the ITA, America pressed APEC’s members for accelerated liberalization on a sectoral basis as a means to revive a stalled regional trade agenda. 
But efforts to reach an agreement to liberalize trade in 15 sectors soon faltered: the cost of selective liberalization in uncompetitive, but politically sensitive, sectors was simply too high for some governments to bear. 
The most important lesson of APEC’s failure is a recognition of the enormous difficulty found in constructing a broad enough, and yet politically acceptable, package when trade negotiations are limited to particular beneficiaries. 
Because some industries no longer care about wide trade agreements because they have already benefited through a sectoral deal, the groups that normally see themselves as gaining from greater trade openness are too weak to offset the political influence of protectionist forces mobilized against liberalization. 
Policymakers who are now attracted to open sectoralism because of its delusive promise of frictionless politics should take that lesson to heart. 
If the full benefits of trade liberalization are to be gained quickly, there is no alternative to resuming comprehensive negotiations – and the tradeoffs between industries that this strategy entails – by reviving the WTO’s Millennium Round. 
It is this agenda, rather than the hollow hope of open sectoralism, that should be the main priority of trade negotiators in the future. 
The Stem-Cell Race Continues 
Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike. 
The stakes and potential rewards for a few research topics are exceptionally high, which is why the recent finding that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk fabricated the results of his work on stem cells has reverberated so widely. 
The episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research that is playing out in the field of stem cells. 
Possibly one of the biggest prizes in medical history is up for grabs, and anyone – truly anyone – could seize it. 
The last big scientific race of this type was the effort to map the human genome, which promises to alter future lives radically. 
That study was initiated by the United States, which used insights developed in the wake of the atomic bombing of Japan to understand the extent of long-term genetic damage. 
The current research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as grand, because it will lead to an equally radical medical revolution. 
A stem cell is special because it is able to reproduce a form that is different from itself. 
Whereas a skin cell or a liver cell, for instance, can reproduce only more skin or liver, stem cells, which are the most robust at the beginning of human development, are “master” cells. 
As a fertilized egg turns into an embryo, and then a fetus, those initial stem cells somehow show their daughter cells how to become skin, liver, eye, or bone. 
We need to know how this transformation is activated. 
Such knowledge would lead to huge, patentable advances. 
Most attention is focused on genetic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and to muscular dystrophy. 
In these cases, stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue. 
This would also benefit patients with brain and spinal injuries, or those who have suffered strokes and paralysis. 
There would be gains in parallel fields, too, such as gene therapy. 
A stem cell changes its identity through a process of “triggering” – a signal literally “turns on” the liver cell gene inside the stem version. 
When scientists figure out how to flip these switches, it might be possible to introduce stem cells into the body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue, whatever it is. 
Not surprisingly, given its huge potential, teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research. 
The race has become all the more dramatic since the leading researcher, the US, dropped out, owing to the influence of religion on politics (although the state of California has decided not to miss out, and recently approved a $3 billion subsidy for embryonic stem cell research). 
Because the promise is so great, and the science does not require massive infrastructure, many smaller countries have rushed to take advantage of the absence of the US. 
Any competent medical research center can enter the race, whether in Mexico, Ethiopia, Indonesia or Yemen. 
Whoever wins will have added the equivalent of a Saudi oil field to their economy. 
But, although anyone can win, science at this level is never a “eureka” event, with some single breakthrough suddenly ending the race. 
Discoveries occur incrementally, and, because it is science, each step is announced and tested. 
Research establishments gain momentum this way, with the leaders sweeping up talent, resources, and prestige in a rough-and-tumble intellectual ecology. 
Embedded in the larger race are many smaller ones, which jostle for early, impressive results. 
In May 2005, Hwang’s research center in Seoul reported the first major achievement. 
They claimed that they had developed a technique whereby new, perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones. 
This was big news, for it implied that sufficient numbers of stem cells could be made without controversy, thus allowing anyone to be able to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W. Bush described as “taking a life to save a life.” 
More importantly, the Koreans did a common thing these days: they claimed patent rights over the process. 
It almost looked for a moment as though South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters. 
We now know that the Seoul researchers made up the whole thing. 
An investigation by a Seoul National University investigative panel has concluded that the “cloned” stem cells were really created by test-tube fertilizations. 
The fraud has bewildered the science community, particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false. 
Why, then, did they place their reputations and careers in jeopardy? 
Medical research has always faced many challenges, even when the scientific quest was simply one of discovery. 
Now, the challenges are complicated by politics, market forces, and national interests. 
With stem cell research, huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead, wherever their laboratory is located. 
As the competition heats up, we should expect amazing developments – and no doubt more public relations gimmicks. 
The Stimulus Ostriches 
BERKELEY – Of all the strange things that have happened this winter, perhaps the strangest has been the emergence of large-scale Republican Party opposition to the Obama administration's effort to keep American unemployment from jumping to 10% or higher. 
There is no doubt that had John McCain won the presidential election last November, a very similar deficit-spending stimulus package to the Obama plan – perhaps with more tax cuts and fewer spending increases – would have moved through Congress with unanimous Republican support. 
As N. Gregory Mankiw said of a stimulus package back in 2003, when he was President George W. Bush's chief economic advisor, this is not rocket science. Deficit spending in a recession, he said, “help[s] maintain the aggregate demand for goods and services. 
There is nothing novel about this. 
It is very conventional short-run stabilization policy: you can find it in all of the leading textbooks...” 
I can understand (though I disagree with) opponents of the stimulus plan who believe that the situation is not that dire; that the government spending will be slow and wasteful (whereas properly targeted tax cuts would provide a more effective stimulus); and thus that it would have been better to defeat Obama’s stimulus bill and try again in a couple of months. 
I can also understand (though I disagree with) opponents who believe that the short-run stimulus effect of the plan will be small, while America’s weak fiscal position implies a large long-run drag on the economy from the costs of servicing the resulting debt. 
What I do not understand is opposition based on the claim that the stimulus package simply will not work: the government will spend its money, households will receive their tax rebates, and nothing will happen afterwards to boost employment and production. 
In fact, there is a surprisingly large current of thought that maintains that stimulus packages simply do not work, ever. 
This opposition is not coming only from politicians who are calculating that opposition to whatever is proposed may yield electoral benefits; indeed, it does not even reflect any coherent right-wing or indeed left-wing political position. 
Root-and-branch stimulus opponents whose work has crossed my desk recently include efficient-markets fundamentalists like the University of Chicago’s Eugene Fama, Marxists like CUNY’s David Harvey, classical economists like Harvard’s Robert Barro, gold bugs like the Council on Foreign Relation's Benn Steil, and a host of others. 
I simply do not understand their arguments that government spending cannot boost the economy. 
As far as I can tell, they are simply burying their heads in the sand. 
At the start of 1996, the US unemployment rate was 5.6%. 
Then America’s businesses and investors discovered the Internet. 
Over the next four years, annual US spending on information technology equipment and software roared upward, from $281 billion to $446 billion, the US unemployment rate dropped from 5.6% to 4%, and the economy grew at a 4.3% real annual rate as the high-tech spending boom pulled extra workers out of unemployment and into jobs. 
Back at the start of 2004, America’s banks discovered that they could borrow money cheaply from Asia and lend it out in higher-yielding domestic mortgages while using sophisticated financial engineering to wall off and strictly control their risks – or so they thought. 
Over the next two years, annual US spending on residential construction roared upward, from $624 billion to $798 billion, the US unemployment rate dropped from 5.7% to 4.6%, and the economy grew at a 3.1% real annual rate. 
In both of these cases, large groups of people in America decided to increase their spending. 
You can argue that neither group should have boosted its spending to such a degree – that both were subject to “irrational exuberance” – and that someone should have taken away the punchbowl earlier. But you cannot argue that these groups did not increase their spending, and that their increased spending did not pull large numbers of Americans – roughly two million in each case – into productive and valued employment. 
The government’s money is as good as anybody else’s. 
If businesses’ enthusiasm for spending on high-tech gadgetry and new homeowners’ enthusiasm for spending on three-bedroom houses can boost employment and production, then what argument can Harvey, Fama, Barro, Steil, and company make that government spending will not? 
I simply do not see it. 
The Storm Before the Calm 
OXFORD – Central banks can stop worrying about inflation. 
Price deflation is far more likely in the near term. 
But temporary deflation need not be the terror that central bankers fear, at least if the banking system is recapitalized and if interest rates in the industrial countries fall sharply. 
As recently as September and October, the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank both saw the risk of inflation as being roughly equal to the risk to growth. 
Both were reluctant to lower interest rates markedly. 
Indeed, financial markets may have taken the Fed’s view on US inflation as representative of other central banks’ outlook on inflation, reinforced by the surprising ECB decision of October 2 to keep interest rates on hold. 
In October the US was on the cusp of the most significant turning point for inflation in the last 20 years. 
Of course, forecasting inflation is notoriously difficult. 
There have been large structural shifts in the world economy (e.g., trade and financial globalization) as well as in individual economies (such as the decline in trade union power). 
Monetary policy itself has shifted to a far greater focus on inflation. 
Moreover, energy and food price shocks can be both large and largely unpredictable, while the speed of price changes tends to increase with big shocks. 
Most forecasting models used by central banks therefore put a large weight on recent inflation. 
This approach tracks inflation quite well, except at turning points , because the models miss key underlying or long-term influences. 
The turning point that the US and world economy are facing is straightforward. 
Global output is probably falling faster than at any rate since World War II, except perhaps for 1974-1975. Under these circumstances, large excess capacity develops and commodity prices fall. 
Indeed, it seems unlikely that governments in China and similar emerging markets can compensate swiftly enough to boost domestic consumption. 
And, with growing over-capacity, investment in goods production may fall even further, with serious implications for GDP. 
Hence demand for commodities, which has been driven by emerging-market growth, has fallen sharply, and help decrease global inflation. 
Eventually, lower commodity prices and lower inflation will act like a huge tax cut for households, allowing interest rates to fall further and thus stabilize economic activity. 
Paradoxically, the faster oil prices now fall, the shorter the subsequent period of deflation will be, as further damage to the economies of industrial countries is avoided. 
Since oil and food prices have fallen sharply, and probably have further to fall, while unemployment is soaring, our models suggest that consumer price inflation, particularly in the US, must fall at record rates over the next 6-12 months. 
It is entirely possible that US inflation, measured over 12 months, will become negative by mid-2009.. 
While some observers still fret about inflation risk, others are concerned that the usual monetary transmission mechanism is not working, and that the US could face a Japanese-style “lost decade,” while others worry about a 1930’s-style slump in the industrial countries. 
So the policy debate now under way is about whether monetary policy can stem deflation and what happens if and when the “zero lower bound” on interest rates is reached. 
The zero lower bound arises because nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero. 
But if nominal interest rates stay positive, while inflation is negative, then real interest rates may become too high for an economy in recession, causing recession to become more severe and prolonged. 
Deflation fears were mistakenly raised in 2001-2003, when the strong response of the US housing market and consumer spending to lower interest rates should have made the debate redundant. 
Influenced by a misreading of the Japanese experience, this led to excessive protection against the “tail risk” of deflation. 
Ironically, that policy response helped to fuel the credit and housing bubble, whose collapse has triggered the current recession, which may actually bring about deflation. 
There are important differences between the structure of the Japanese and the US economies, including the enormously high level of liquid assets held by Japanese households, which tends to lead to lower consumption when interest rates fall. 
These differences, and the lessons that have been learned from Japan’s “lost decade” about the need to refinance the banking system, suggest that a “lost decade” for the US is most unlikely. 
The policy implications outside the US and Japan, where rates are close to zero, are that central banks can safely cut policy rates and continue aggressive liquidity support operations with little risk of inflation.,.. 
In any case, with so little confidence in the financial system, and credit constrained by concerns about falling housing prices, the usual transmission channels from the policy rate have been blocked. 
Thus, the emerging emphasis on recapitalizing the banking system and more recently, on unorthodox policies, including the purchase of private sector credit securities is correct. 
As some confidence returns in an eventually recapitalized banking system, and long bond yields decline with the fall in inflation, mortgage and other borrowing rates will fall and monetary transmission mechanisms will revive, supporting economic activity and stabilizing real house prices, albeit at a substantially lower level. 
Finally, there are two major differences between the 1930’s and the present. 
The industrial world is now far more dependent on (mostly foreign) oil than it was then. 
The extreme rise in real oil prices was a major cause of the current recession, and its reversal will be a major factor in recovery. 
The other crucial difference is that we know enough not to repeat the errors – particularly trade protectionism – of the 1930’s. 
The Storm in Sub-Saharan Africa 
WASHINGTON, DC – As the world struggles with the most serious financial turmoil of the post-war era, attention has focused on the advanced and emerging-market economies most immediately affected. 
But the impact on poor countries is far more severe. 
Weak global growth is shrinking export markets, and many commodity prices are plunging. 
The combination of tighter credit conditions in the advanced economies and dimmer economic prospects in low-income countries is hitting investment flows. 
And workers’ remittances, which now eclipse aid as the biggest financial flows to low-income countries, are also falling. 
Sub-Saharan Africa depends heavily on commodity exports, so it is especially vulnerable to the global downturn. 
Many African countries have used the past decade to put in place sound and sustainable economic policies that have delivered robust growth and low inflation. 
Together with debt relief, these policies have resulted in low levels of public debt, relatively sound financial systems, and – most important – rising living standards. 
These gains are now at risk. 
The high food and fuel prices that prevailed until recently have taken a heavy toll on the finances of many African economies. 
Now they face a second blow from the global recession. 
The priority for Africa and the international community must be to ensure that the continent weathers the global financial storm, preserves the significant achievements of the past decade, and continues to make decisive progress in combating poverty. 
This is not the time to take a break from efforts to achieve the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. 
How to help Africa meet this challenge – including by learning from the lessons of past success – will be the goal of a major conference sponsored by the IMF and President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania, to be held in Dar-es-Salaam this March. 
This discussion of Africa’s prospects will involve not only official policy makers, but also representatives of the private sector and civil society, which, as we all recognize, have a key role to play. 
Clearly, the responsibility to implement sound economic policies rests with African countries themselves. 
But the international community must stand ready to help. 
My view is that strong policies on the African side, with strong support from the international community, offer the best prospects for sustained growth and poverty reduction in Africa. 
Here are three priorities that should guide us: 
· First, while there may be scope for fiscal stimulus in some countries, in many countries it is limited; hence, the region as a whole must protect its hard-won low level of public debt. 
When the storm has passed, low levels of public debt and sustainable public finances will be crucial to preserving spending that helps the poor and to bringing back the international investors who are indispensable for Africa’s future growth; 
· Second, falling international prices create an opportunity to bring inflation back down from uncomfortably high levels caused by the global food and fuel price crisis early last year. 
This does not mean imposing rigid inflation targets. 
But a predictable monetary policy aimed at delivering medium-term price stability – with a flexible exchange rate where appropriate – benefits both the private sector and, most importantly, the poor. 
· Third, the international community is obliged to deliver on its commitment to increase aid. 
This is not the time to renege on those commitments. 
It is equally important to restart global trade talks and bring the Doha Round to a successful conclusion – not least in order to protect Africa from the risk of rising protectionism. 
The IMF stands ready to do its part. 
We are working closely with our 53 African members on crafting the appropriate policy response. 
We have increased our financing to the countries most heavily affected by food and fuel shocks. 
And we stand ready to provide additional support – including under a new financing mechanism for countries hit by exogenous shocks – to help those whom the global financial crisis has affected most severely. 
We are also stepping up our technical assistance to strengthen economic policy making in Africa, and opening two new regional technical assistance centers. 
At the conference in Tanzania, we look forward to feedback and ideas about how the Fund can do even more – and differently. 
As Africa and its partners navigate the financial storm together, we must ensure that the most vulnerable are not forgotten. 
We must also ensure that solutions for strengthening financial stability and avoiding future turmoil – the focus of April’s G-20 summit – are discussed with all countries concerned. 
All eyes are focused right now on the immediate crisis. 
But we must not lose sight of the longer-term challenges that will remain after the storm abates. 
The Tanzania conference will allow us to assess what we have learned from past successes, as well as what needs to change in the future. 
Our shared objective is clear: to ensure that Africa not only weathers the immediate storm, but emerges from it stronger. 
The Straits of America 
NEW YORK – Macroeconomic indicators for the United States have been better than expected for the last few months. Job creation has picked up. 
Indicators for manufacturing and services have improved moderately. Even the housing industry has shown some signs of life. 
But, despite the favorable data, US economic growth will remain weak and below trend throughout 2012. 
Why is all the recent economic good news not to be believed? 
First, US consumers remain income-challenged, wealth-challenged, and debt-constrained. 
Disposable income has been growing modestly – despite real-wage stagnation – mostly as a result of tax cuts and transfer payments. This is not sustainable: eventually, transfer payments will have to be reduced and taxes raised to reduce the fiscal deficit. 
Recent consumption data are already weakening relative to a couple of months ago, marked by holiday retail sales that were merely passable. 
At the same time, US job growth is still too mediocre to make a dent in the overall unemployment rate and on labor income. 
The US needs to create at least 150,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis just to stabilize the unemployment rate. 
More than 40% of the unemployed are now long-term unemployed, which reduces their chances of ever regaining a decent job. 
Indeed, firms are still trying to find ways to slash labor costs. 
Rising income inequality will also constrain consumption growth, as income shares shift from those with a higher marginal propensity to spend (workers and the less wealthy) to those with a higher marginal propensity to save (corporate firms and wealthy households). 
Moreover, the recent bounce in investment spending (and housing) will end, with bleak prospects for 2012, as tax benefits expire, firms wait out so-called “tail risks” (low-probability, high-impact events), and insufficient final demand holds down capacity-utilization rates. 
And most capital spending will continue to be devoted to labor-saving technologies, again implying limited job creation. 
At the same time, even after six years of a housing recession, the sector is comatose. 
With demand for new homes having fallen by 80% relative to the peak, the downward price adjustment is likely to continue in 2012 as the supply of new and existing homes continues to exceed demand. 
Up to 40% of households with a mortgage – 20 million – could end up with negative equity in their homes. 
Thus, the vicious cycle of foreclosures and lower prices is likely to continue – and, with so many households severely credit-constrained, consumer confidence, while improving, will remain weak. 
Given anemic growth in domestic demand, America’s only chance to move closer to its potential growth rate would be to reduce its large trade deficit. 
But net exports will be a drag on growth in 2012, for several reasons: 
· The dollar would have to weaken further, which is unlikely, because many other central banks have followed the Federal Reserve in additional “quantitative easing,” with the euro likely to remain under downward pressure and China and other emerging-market countries still aggressively intervening to prevent their currencies from rising too fast. 
· Slower growth in many advanced economies, China, and other emerging markets will mean lower demand for US exports. 
· Oil prices are likely to remain elevated, given geopolitical risks in the Middle East, keeping the US energy-import bill high. 
It is unlikely that US policy will come to the rescue. 
On the contrary, there will be a significant fiscal drag in 2012, and political gridlock in the run-up to the presidential election in November will prevent the authorities from addressing long-term fiscal issues. 
Given the bearish outlook for US economic growth, the Fed can be expected to engage in another round of quantitative easing. 
But the Fed also faces political constraints, and will do too little, and move too late, to help the economy significantly. 
Moreover, a vocal minority on the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is against further easing. 
In any case, monetary policy can address only liquidity problems – and banks are flush with excess reserves. 
Most importantly, the US – and many other advanced economies – remains in the early stages of a deleveraging cycle. 
A recession caused by too much debt and leverage (first in the private sector, and then on public balance sheets) will require a long period of spending less and saving more. 
This year will be no different, as public-sector deleveraging has barely started. 
Finally, there are those tail risks that make investors, corporations, and consumers hyper-cautious: the eurozone, where debt restructurings – or worse, breakup – are risks of systemic consequence; the outcome of the US presidential election; geo-political risks such as the Arab Spring, military confrontation with Iran, instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan, North Korea’s succession, and the leadership transition in China; and the consequences of a global economic slowdown. 
Given all of these large and small risks, businesses, consumers, and investors have a strong incentive to wait and do little. 
The problem, of course, is that when enough people wait and don’t act, they heighten the very risks that they are trying to avoid. 
The Strange Death of Multiculturalism 
An ideology which holds that people from different cultures must live in separate communities within a country, should not take an interest in each other and must not criticise each other is both wrong and unworkable. 
Of course, multiculturalism’s more thoughtful advocates never imagined that a cultural community could or should substitute for a political community. 
They believed that so long as everyone abided by the law, it was not necessary for citizens to have a single hierarchy of values. 
The ideal of multiculturalism at home was echoed with an ideology of cultural relativism abroad, especially in the 1970’s and 1980’s. 
This evolved stealthily into a form of moral racism which held that white Europeans deserved liberal democracy but that people of different cultures had to wait for it. 
African dictators might do dreadful things but somehow they did not meet with condemnation from many European intellectuals, for criticism implied cultural arrogance. 
The Netherlands, where I was born, has perhaps been divided by the debate over multiculturalism more than any other country. 
The murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh two and a half years ago by an Islamist assassin has incited a wrenching debate about the country’s entrenched culture of tolerance and easy access for asylum-seekers. 
Long before the arrival of Muslim guest workers in the 1960’s and 1970’s Dutch society was in a sense ‘multicultural’ in that it was already organised into Protestant, Catholic, liberal and socialist “pillars,” each with its own schools, hospitals, TV stations, papers and political parties. 
When guest workers from Morocco and Turkey became de facto immigrants, some began to champion the creation of an additional Muslim pillar. 
But at the moment that multiculturalism’s advocates were making this suggestion, Dutch society was undergoing a dramatic transition. 
With secularization taking hold, the traditional pillars began to break down. 
Moreover, fierce attacks on Muslims started to come from people who, raised in deeply religious families, had turned into radical leftists in the 1960’s and 1970’s. 
From defining themselves as anti-colonialists and anti-racists – champions of multiculturalism amp#45;amp#45; they have become fervent defenders of so-called Enlightenment values against Muslim orthodoxy. 
These people feared the comeback of religion; that the Protestant or Catholic oppressiveness they knew first-hand might be replaced by equally oppressive Muslim codes of conduct. 
But their turn away from multiculturalism is not what prevented the emergence of a “Islamic” pillar in Dutch society. 
The main problem with this idea was that people from Turkey, Morocco, and the Arab countries, some deeply religious and some quite secular, and all with perceptible animosities towards each other, would never have agreed on what should constitute such a pillar. 
In any case, it is now too late to create such a pillar. 
With the earlier pillars having collapsed, the emergence of a new one would bring about a situation where an increasingly integrated majority would be negotiating with a minority, thus perpetuating its isolation in the process. 
Whether Europeans like it or not, Muslims are part of Europe. 
Many will not abandon their religion, so Europeans must learn to live with them and with Islam. 
Of course, this will be easier if Muslims come to believe that the system also works to their benefit. 
Liberal democracy and Islam are reconcilable. 
Indonesia’s current political transition from dictatorship to democracy, although no unqualified success, shows that this is achievable. 
Even if all of Europe’s Muslims were Islamists – which is a far cry from reality – they could not threaten the Continent’s sovereignty and, by the same token, its laws and Enlightenment values. 
Of course, there are groups to which Islamism appeals. 
The children of immigrants, born in Europe, sense they are not fully accepted in the country where they grew up, but neither do they feel a special bond with their parent’s native country. 
Islamism, besides offering them an answer to the question why they do not feel happy with the way they live, gives them a sense of their self-worth and a great cause to die for. 
In the end, the only thing that can truly damage European values is Europe’s response to its non-Muslim majority. 
Fear of Islam and of immigrants could lead to the adoption of non-liberal laws. 
By defending Enlightenment values in a dogmatic way Europeans will be the ones who undermine them. 
Our laws prohibiting incitement to violence and insulting people for reasons of their religion are sufficient. 
Further constraints on freedom of speech – such as anti-blasphemy laws or, indeed, those laws that make Holocaust denial punishable – go too far. 
But this doesn’t mean that we should not weigh our words with care. 
We should distinguish carefully between different kinds of Islam, and not confuse violent revolutionary movements with mere religious orthodoxy. 
Insulting Muslims simply on the basis of their faith is foolish and counterproductive, as is the increasingly popular notion that we must make sweeping pronouncements as to the superiority of “our culture.” 
For such dogmatism undermines scepticism, the questioning of all views, including one’s own, which was and is the fundamental feature of the Enlightenment. 
The trouble today is that Enlightenment values are sometimes used in a very dogmatic way against Muslims. 
They have become in fact a form of nationalism – “our values” have been set against “their values.” 
The reason for defending Enlightenment values is that they are based on good ideas, and not because they are “our culture.” 
To confuse culture and politics in this way is to fall into the same trap as the multiculturalists. 
And it has serious consequences. 
If we antagonize Europe’s Muslims enough we will push more people into joining the Islamist revolution. 
We must do everything to encourage Europe’s Muslim to become assimilated in European societies. 
It is our only hope. 
The Strange Rebirth of American Leadership 
FLORENCE – At the recent annual meetings of the American Economic Association, there was widespread pessimism about the future of the United States. “The age of American predominance is over,” declared one economist. 
“The US should brace for social unrest amid blame over who was responsible for squandering global primacy,” said another. 
We have heard this story many times before, not only in the US, but in other places as well. George Dangerfield’s controversial history, The Strange Death of Liberal England, describes his country’s sudden decline at the peak of its power at the turn of the last century. 
The world everyone knew simply and inexplicably seemed to disappear. 
Many Americans – think of the Tea Party’s adherents, for example – fear that something similar is happening to their own country. 
Or that it has already happened. 
Dangerfield based his diagnosis on a cross-section of institutions, politics, and personalities, set against the bitter class warfare of the time. 
Americans, however, have generally been averse to class warfare. 
True, the US has been home to a rigid, albeit comparably fluid, class structure ever since its founding. 
But Americans just don’t like to talk about it, even when they are whining about the follies of the “elite.” 
Nearly all Americans, apart from the richest and poorest, define themselves as “middle class.” 
Such remains America’s democratic ethos. 
Still, it is right to ask if the American way of life will survive the twenty-first century, and, if it does, whether it will survive in America or migrate elsewhere as the US economy and political system collapse under the accumulated weight of decades of myopic national leadership and squandered opportunities. 
Indeed, Chinese President Hu Jintao’s recent trip to Washington was seen by many – particularly many Chinese – as the passing of the torch. 
Pessimists have been saying this for a long time. 
Optimists, touting GDP and other indicators, will continue to insist that Americans have never had it so good. 
If there is any continuity worth underscoring, it is the regular cohabitation of boosterism with declinism: America’s glass is always simultaneously half full and half empty. 
It is no coincidence that during the Reagan/Bush years – the last time so assertive a foreign policy coincided with such large deficits – a book like Joseph Nye’s Bound to Lead (1990) could follow in the footsteps of Paul Kennedy’s The Rise and Fall of Great Powers (1988). 
The former made a strong case for the necessity of American global hegemony; the latter warned of “imperial overstretch.” 
Both authors based their arguments on an assessment of the underlying context – that is, the structure – of world power. 
America was overstretched because its global liabilities were increasingly out of balance with its national assets, and it was bound to lead because the world as we know it is arranged favorably for it to do so. 
Similar arguments have been raised again recently. 
Writers Parag Khanna and Fareed Zakaria have regurgitated those made by Kennedy, Nye, and forebears like Hedley Bull in asserting that the US must lead the world away from a “new medievalism” amid the “rise of the rest” and the relative stagnation of the “West.” 
But are such writers making a valid point? 
If we look at moments of so-called structural convergence – the 1880’s, 1920’s, 1950’s and 1960’s, and 1990’s, in particular – we see the sources of American prosperity and power emerged in a global context, only to recede again. 
Perhaps rise and fall is more of a cyclical than a linear phenomenon. 
Or maybe it’s neither. 
The missing variable in most of these arguments, even Nye’s, is leadership. 
Leaders are never bound to rise or fall by circumstances alone. 
Most historians place leadership in the foreground of human history, with structural variables having conditional, not causal, value. 
Beneath even the richest soil, Dangerfield wrote, may lie the most perilous residue of discord and destruction. 
Why have Americans been so good at leading? 
Are Americans specially blessed, or just lucky? 
Now that the US has at last begun to move, gradually and thoughtfully, away from the passions that characterized the country’s response to the 2001 terrorist attacks, it is worth asking if Bill Clinton was right to say that America’s virtues and assets always prevail against its vices and defects. 
The writers mentioned above are less interested in the essence of power than in its exercise. 
They would rather have the US become more sophisticated in the ways of the world. 
Khanna, for example – presumably drawing upon the recent writing of Edward Luttwak – urges Americans to learn from the Byzantine Empire in crafting complex and obscure alliances among large and small states and non-state entities, so that diplomacy comes to resemble something like the global derivatives market. 
Americans don’t do this particularly well, however Byzantine their country’s own politics and policy-making may seem. 
Which takes us back to structure. 
The US political system was never designed to rule the world. Its checks and balances were meant to frustrate any such mission at the hands of an all-powerful executive, and it is doubtful that Americans would support such activism in perpetuity. 
The secrets of American success are transparent yet difficult to quantify. 
Americans’ pragmatism, opportunism, fair-mindedness, inventiveness, adaptability, optimism, and, above all, their inherent competitiveness offset their tendencies toward violence, impatience, self-righteousness, and unpredictability, their fondness for novelty and celebrity for their own sake, and their self-assertion en masse – getting there, as they like to say, “fastest with the mostest.” 
Those who understand Americans’ deep-rooted passion for “making it” know why class or any other civil warfare has not succeeded in destroying America from within. 
The American character prefers displacement to destruction, the win-win to the zero-sum. 
That is still true, both at home and abroad. 
The Streets of 2012 
NEW YORK – What does the New Year hold for the global wave of protest that erupted in 2011? 
Did the surge of anger that began in Tunisia crest in lower Manhattan, or is 2012 likely to see an escalation of the politics of dissent? 
The answers are alarming but quite predictable: we are likely to see much greater centralization of top-down suppression – and a rash of laws around the developed and developing world that restrict human rights. 
But we are also likely to see significant grassroots reaction. 
What we are witnessing in the drama of increasingly globalized protest and repression is the subplot that many cheerleaders for neoliberal globalization never addressed: the power of globalized capital to wreak havoc with the authority of democratically elected governments. 
From the perspective of global corporate interests, closed societies like China are more business-friendly than troublesome democracies, where trade unions, high standards of human-rights protection, and a vigorous press increase costs. 
All over the world, the pushback against protest looks similar, suggesting that state and corporate actors are learning “best practices” for repressing dissent while maintaining democratic facades. 
In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron routinely impugns human-rights laws; the Metropolitan Police have sought authority to use baton rounds – foot-long projectiles that have caused roughly a dozen deaths, including that of children, in Northern Ireland – on peaceful protesters; and a police report on the threat of terrorism, distributed to “trusted partners” among London businesses,included updates about Occupy protests and referred to “suspected activists.” 
The UK has stringent internal-security legislation, but it never had a law like the United States Patriot Act. 
After anti-austerity protests in early 2011, followed by riots in major cities in August, the Metropolitan Police claimed powers to monitor private social-media accounts and smartphones. 
And, under the guise of protecting this summer’s Olympics against terrorism, the British military is establishing a massive base in London from which SAS (special forces) teams will operate – a radical departure from Britain’s traditional civil policing. 
In Israel, Ha’aretz reports that Occupy-type protests have been met with police violence, including a beating of a 15-year-old girl, and threats of random arrest. 
Israel, like Britain, has seen a push, seemingly out of nowhere, to enact new laws crippling newsgathering and criminalizing dissent: a new law makes it potentially a crime to donate to left-wing organizations, human-rights laws have been weakened, and even investigative reporting has become more dangerous, owing to stricter libel penalties. 
Ha’aretz calls the push “the new feudalism.” 
Finally, in America, the National Defense Authorization Act, enacted by Congress in December, allows the president to suspend due process for US citizens, detain them indefinitely, and render them for torture. 
One should not be surprised to see similar legislation adopted in democracies worldwide. 
Not only are laws criminalizing previously legal dissent, organizing, and reporting being replicated in advanced democracies; so are violent tactics against protesters, backed by the increasing push in countries with long traditions of civil policing to militarize law enforcement. 
Indeed, increasingly sophisticated weapons systems and protective equipment are being disseminated to civilian police officers. 
In the US, the federal government has spent an estimated $34 billion since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to arm state and local police forces with battlefield-grade hardware. 
Investigative reporting has also revealed cross-pollination of anti-protest training: local police from cities like Austin, Texas, have been sent to Israel for training in crowd control and other tactics. 
The globalization of mercenaries to crack down on dissent is also proceeding apace. 
Mercenaries are important in a time of global grassroots protest, because it is easier to turn a foreigner’s guns or batons against strangers than it is to turn the military or police against fellow citizens. 
Erik Prince, the head of the most infamous outfit, Academi (formerly Xe Services, formerly Blackwater), has relocated to the UAE, while Pakistani mercenaries have been recruited in large numbers to Bahrain, where protesters have been met with increasingly violent repression. 
But this apparently coordinated pushback against global protest movements is not yet triumphant – not even in China, as the people of Wukan have shown. 
While the outcome of the villagers’ protest against the local government’s confiscation of their land remains uncertain, the standoff reveals new power at the grassroots level: social media allows sharper, coordinated gatherings and the rapid dissemination of news unfiltered by official media. 
The Internet is also disseminating templates of what real democracy looks like – instantly and worldwide. 
Not surprisingly, people use this technology in ways that indicate that they have little interest in being cordoned off into conflicting and competing ethnicities, nationalities, or religious identities. 
Overwhelmingly, they want simple democracy and economic self-determination. 
That agenda is in direct conflict with the interests of global capital and governments that have grown accustomed to operating without citizen oversight. 
It is a conflict that can be expected to heighten dramatically in 2012, as protesters’ agendas – from Occupy Wall Street to Occupy Moscow – gain further coherence. 
Much is at stake. 
Depending on the outcome, the world will come to look either more like China – open for business, but closed for dissent – or more like Denmark. 
China’s Dream Team 
NEW HAVEN – China’s recent leadership transition was widely depicted as a triumph for conservative hard-liners and a setback for the cause of reform – a characterization that has deepened the gloominess that pervades Western perceptions of China. 
In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. 
Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang – the top two officials in China’s new governing council (the Standing Committee of the Politburo) – are both well educated, well traveled, and sophisticated thinkers who bring a wealth of experience to the many challenges that China faces. 
As so-called Fifth Generation leaders, they continue the steady progress in competence that has marked each of China’s leadership transitions since the emergence of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970’s. 
While it is entirely premature to judge the style and direction that China’s new leaders will take, three early hints are worth noting. 
First, Xi’s assumption of power is more complete than was the case in earlier transitions. 
By immediately taking the reins of both the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Central Military Commission, he has a greater opportunity to put his personal stamp on policy than his predecessors had at the start of their administrations. 
Yes, China governs by a consensus of the Standing Committee. But Xi is well positioned to drive the thinking of a now-leaner decision-making body (downsized from nine members to seven). 
Moreover, he has long favored a market-friendly, scientific approach to economic development, which will be vital to China’s future. 
Second, Li Keqiang – the presumptive incoming premier – could be the big surprise in the new leadership team. 
Unlike the current premier, Wen Jiabao, who was third in the chain of command for the past ten years, Li has been elevated to number two, which suggests a greater potential for power-sharing between the CCP and the government at the top of China’s new team. 
With a Ph.D. in economics, Li, who, as Executive Vice Premier, headed the all-important “Central Committee Finance and Economy Leading Small Group,” is especially well equipped to deal with the long-awaited structural transformation of China’s economy. 
Indeed, having overseen China 2030 – an extraordinary joint report recently produced by the World Bank and China’s own high-level think tank, the Development Research Center – he has a deep understanding of the roadmap that China must embrace. 
His promotion could be a major step up from Wen, who emphasized rhetoric and strategy more than implementation. 
Third, and contrary to prevailing wisdom in the West, Wang Qishan, one of China’s savviest and most experienced senior officials, has not been relegated to obscurity in his new position overseeing “discipline” on the Standing Committee. 
Yes, Wang has invaluable experience in the financial sector, and it would have been logical for him to assume similar responsibilities on the new leadership team. 
But, as one of the top seven in the CCP hierarchy, he will still be able to weigh in on all important economic and financial matters, while assuming responsibility for tackling one of China’s toughest problems – corruption. 
Having known Wang for more than 15 years, my sense is that he is very well suited to this vital task. 
The other members of the new Standing Committee bring a broad array of experience and skills. 
That is especially true of Yu Zhengsheng and the two Zhangs, Dejiang and Gaoli, who come from senior roles in three of China’s most powerful and dynamic urban centers – Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin. 
Their deep knowledge of the key role played by urbanization in driving economic development will be critical to broadening the structural transformation that China now faces. 
The West is not only overlooking the new Chinese leaders’ enhanced skill set, but is also misjudging the current state of the country’s economy, which, while far from perfect, is not crisis-torn and in desperate need of a quick fix. 
In fact, China is emerging in reasonably good shape from yet another global slump. 
This gives its new leaders leeway between now and the National People’s Congress in March 2013 to focus on the development of implementation tactics for their strategic agenda. 
None of this is to minimize China’s enormous challenges. 
But strategy is not the problem; the pro-consumption 12th Five-Year Plan lays that out with great clarity. 
The new leadership must now shift the focus to commitment and implementation of that strategy – namely, through enactment of a new set of bold reforms, especially those related to the services sector, the social safety net, and state-owned enterprises. 
Xi’s emphasis on the “top-level design” of reforms lends itself particularly well to this agenda, as does Li’s intimate familiarity with the detailed blueprint provided by China 2030. 
Western observers, focusing on recent public statements by Xi and Li, highlight a dearth of comments in favor of economic or political reforms. 
But the same could have been said of the early utterances of Deng, modern China’s greatest reformer. 
As Ezra Vogel notes in Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China, Deng’s first public statement after his political rehabilitation in 1976 was, “Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought constitute the guiding ideology of the party.” 
Those were not exactly enlightened words – especially in view of what was shortly to come. 
Yet Deng seized the moment at a critical juncture that is strikingly reminiscent of the one now faced by Xi and Li. 
As is the case in any country’s leadership transition, no one knows for certain whether China’s incoming administration is up to the multiplicity of challenges that they face. 
Since the days of Deng, China has had an uncanny ability to rise to the occasion and meet its challenges head on. 
The new generation of leaders has the right skills and experience for the task. 
Western biases notwithstanding, we will know soon enough if they can translate strategy into action. 
The Stressed-Out Brain 
NEW YORK – Stress contributes to the onset of cardiovascular disease and depression, among other illnesses. 
And it is not only major stressful life events that exact a toll on our bodies; the many conflicts and demands of daily life elevate and sometimes disrupt the workings of our response systems for stress, causing wear and tear on the body and brain. 
This burden of chronic stress, called “allostatic overload,” reflects not only the impact of life experiences but also our genetic constitution. 
Moreover, individual habits such as diet, exercise, the quality and quantity of sleep, and substance abuse also play a major role, as do early life experiences that set life-long patterns of behavior and physiological reactivity. 
There are three categories of stress: 
· Positive stress, for which a person feels rewarded by surmounting a challenge. 
· Tolerable stress, which results from serious life events – for example, divorce, death of a loved one, loss of a job – but where the affected person has good support systems. 
· Toxic stress, which involves the same types of serious events, as well as the accumulation of daily struggles, but without good support systems. 
The difference between tolerable and toxic stress depends on the perceived degree of control that a person experiences. 
Moreover, low self-esteem exacerbates a feeling of helplessness and lack of control. 
Social support by friends and family is vital to ameliorating the effects of tolerable stress and keeping it from becoming toxic. 
These are all functions of the brain – the key organ in our response to stress. 
The brain interprets what is threatening and, therefore, stressful; regulates behavioral and physiological stress responses – the latter through the autonomic, immune, and neuroendocrine systems; and is a target of stress, undergoing structural and functional remodeling of its circuits that affects its performance. 
This remodeling includes limited replacement of neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region important for spatial memory and memory of events in our daily lives. 
The recognition of the brain’s vulnerability and plasticity under stress began with investigations of the hippocampus, and it now includes the amygdala, a brain region involved in fear, anxiety, and mood, and the prefrontal cortex, which is important in decision making, memory, and top-down control of impulsive behavior, as well as regulation of the autonomic nervous system and stress hormone axis. 
Repeated stress causes neurons in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex to shrink and lose connections with other nerve cells, while it also causes neurons in the amygdala to grow and form new connections. 
Because the remodeling of neurons by stress is reversible, researchers now believe that chronic anxiety disorders and depression represent a lack of resilience, or spontaneous recovery, in susceptible individuals. 
Such a lack of recovery then requires medication, behavioral interventions, or both. 
Hormones associated with stress protect the body and brain in the short run and promote adaptation, but the chronic activity of these same hormones brings about changes in the body that cause allostatic overload, along with its potential follow-on diseases. 
For example, the immune system is enhanced by acute stress but suppressed by chronic stress. 
By the same token, the brain shows enhanced activity during acute stress, with improvement in certain types of memory, but undergoes structural changes that increase anxiety and decrease mental flexibility and memory capacity as a result of chronic stress. 
Developmental influences involving the quality of parenting and acquisition of attachment have a powerful influence on subsequent stress vulnerability during the rest of our lives – for example, abuse and neglect in childhood increase our vulnerability to physical and mental disorders, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and antisocial behavior. 
Among the most potent causes of stress in adult life are those arising from competitive interactions between animals of the same species, leading to the formation of dominance hierarchies. 
Psychosocial stress of this type not only alters cognitive function in lower-ranking animals, but it can also promote disease (for example, atherosclerosis) among those vying for the dominant position. 
Social ordering in human society is associated with gradients of disease, with an increasing frequency of mortality and morbidity as one descends the scale of socioeconomic status, which reflects both income and education. 
Although the causes of these gradients of health are very complex, they are likely to reflect, with increasing frequency at the lower end of the scale, the cumulative burden of coping with limited resources and stressors as well as differences in lifestyle, and the resulting allostatic overload that this burden places on the physiological systems involved in adaptation and coping. 
The brain’s response to stress does not necessarily constitute “damage” per se and is amenable to reversal as well as prevention by treatments that include drugs, exercise, diet, and social support. 
And, because the social environment has powerful effects through the brain on the rest of the body, public and private-sector policies can have a positive impact on health, providing a top-down benefit to brain and body function. 
This may occur through policies that improve education, provide better housing, improve commuting, regulate working conditions, increase availability of health foods, and provide tax relief for those in the lower and middle classes. 
Such policies might well prevent disease, thereby saving money, reducing human suffering, and promoting healthier and more meaningful lives. 
The Stressful Life of Laboratory Animals 
Research on animals is performed to gain more knowledge about diseases and how to cure them, and to evaluate drugs for toxicity before testing them on humans. 
In fact, animal studies have played a vital role in almost every major medical advance. 
Although researchers are committed to finding new ways to reduce and replace animal testing, current technology cannot yet replace many types of animal research. 
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics estimates that between 50 and 100 million animals, from flies to monkeys, are euthanized for research each year worldwide, with roughly 90% of the vertebrate animals used for research being rodents. 
Gaining useful knowledge from animal research requires robust experimental findings: different scientists should be able to reproduce them in different locations. 
This requires a thorough understanding of each animal species and its biology. 
Evidence is gradually accumulating that the majority of mammalian research animals, particularly rodents, are mentally stressed by their living conditions. 
Stress is generally defined as the state that results when the brain instructs the body to make changes in order to adapt to a new or excessive demand and the individual perceives that the demand will exceed the personal resources which he or she has available. 
The response is fuelled by stress hormones that flow through the body, altering every organ and biochemical function, with wide-ranging effects on metabolism, growth, and reproduction. 
Although the environments of laboratory animals are usually well controlled in terms of lighting, temperature, and humidity, there are many uncontrolled sources of noise in animal facilities, most of which derive from human activities. 
These include high-pressure hoses, cage cleaners, and air-conditioners/heaters; squeaking doors, carts, and movable chairs; and jangling keys. 
Rodents, in particular, are sensitive to these noises, and studies show that this sensitivity does not diminish with time, as is commonly assumed. 
These noises can alter rodents’ behavior and even adversely affect their health. 
Yet, surprisingly, many scientists are unaware that loud noises in their animal facilities can affect research outcomes and compromise their data. 
Apart from noise problems, research animals are often housed in small cages with no source of enrichment, such as wheels, shelves, or tubes. 
Such devices enable animals to exert some control over their environment, such as escaping an attack from a cage-mate by moving to another level in the cage or hiding. 
Often, researchers are unwilling to include such items in their animals’ cages because other researchers do not. 
However, rigorous standardization of the environment, particularly if it leads to barren surroundings, increases the risk of obtaining results that, being specific to a narrow set of conditions, cannot be compared with other researchers’ results. 
If animals are under stress, they can have permanently raised concentrations of stress hormones, reduced concentrations of sex hormones, and compromised immune systems. 
These uncontrolled variables make the animals unsuitable subjects for scientific studies. 
To ensure good science, research animals should be healthy and exhibit normal behavior, apart from the specific effects under investigation. 
Researchers often dismiss questions concerning environmental influences on their experimental data by claiming that such effects “cancel out,” because their control animals are housed under the same conditions. 
But the conclusions drawn from such experiments are specific to the stressed animals and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to healthy animals. 
The increasing use of genetically modified mice since their advent 20 years ago amplifies this problem. 
Genetically modified mice either lack a specific gene or gene-pair (knock-out mice) or carry a piece of foreign DNA integrated into their own chromosomes (transgenic mice), and are used to deduce the functions of particular genes. 
Studies are beginning to show that an animal’s environmental conditions can completely change the results of genetic studies. 
A more humane and effective way to ensure the validity and usefulness of animal experimentation would be to provide conditions that minimize stress-related activities such as excessive grooming and fighting. 
In addition, the environment should allow the animals to perform the behaviors normal for their species. 
Normal and aberrant behaviors for each species could be agreed upon institutionally and a list made available to all investigators. 
Designing an environment to suit animals’ psychological and physiological needs would be far preferable to the minimalism, otherwise known as “standardization,” that is currently employed. 
The exact conditions used to achieve these goals would probably vary between laboratories. But the end result would be similar. 
Both the welfare of research animals and the quality of the science would be markedly improved, leading to data that could be meaningfully applied to our quest for medical knowledge. 
The Strong Force is Almost With Us 
HAMBURG – Roughly 60 years ago, the discovery of nuclear power promised the ultimate solution to the world’s energy problems. 
Today, this promise remains unfulfilled. 
Development of nuclear technology has stagnated, with nuclear power plants still using technology developed a half-century ago.amp#160; 
Nuclear energy is produced in the decay processes of heavy elements, like Uranium or Thorium. 
The nuclei of their atoms usually decay into two smaller nuclei and a couple of neutrons, releasing many million times more energy than any chemical process ever could. 
Heavy elements contain so much energy because they stored a fraction of the energy released in the supernova explosion that created our Earth and the solar system around five billion years ago.amp#160; 
Today’s power plants use as a fuel a special kind of Uranium, U-235, which is burned in a chain process whereby the neutrons from one nuclear decay induce the next decay. 
Neither Uranium-238, which is roughly 100 times more abundant than U-235, nor Thorium, which is even more accessible, is used to produce energy on a large scale. 
Indeed, in principle, every heavy element, even lead, is a potential source of nuclear energy. 
Everybody who has studied nuclear decay processes has been struck by the myriad possible ways in which energy can be produced. 
Progress in gaining access to this resource has, however, been very slow. 
From the scientific point of view, the main problem is a lack of knowledge. 
Despite many hundreds of well-functioning nuclear power plants, our understanding of nuclear forces is only empirical, and empirical knowledge is always imperfect. 
For example, in producing nuclear energy, the decay reactions repeat many times, with the imperfections of every repetition resulting in a loss of predictive power of computations. 
This hampers the optimization process, and is one of the main reasons why several large projects investigating energy production using more abundant Uranium-238 or Thorium (fast breeder reactors) were closed in Europe and the United States before they achieved the expected level of performance. 
Another problem is the nuclear waste that emerges when energy is produced in the decay process. 
The waste can be substantially, or even completely, reduced if we could use an alternative form of nuclear decay that is triggered by externally accelerated particles. 
Here, too, however, we need more precise knowledge of the properties of nuclear processes. 
The force binding atomic nuclei is a special case of the “strong force,” one of the four fundamental forces in nature, and is extremely difficult to investigate, because it acts very quickly and violently. 
Around 50 years ago, it was proposed to study the strong forces by firing protons at each other at very high energies. 
The acceleration of particles at high energy slows down all physical processes, because, according to Einstein’s theory of relativity, time runs more slowly for fast-moving objects. 
Since protons are the simplest nuclei, it was hoped that, at high energy, the forces acting during the scattering of protons could be observed and analyzed like in a slow-motion film, providing a precise understanding of the strong force. 
Several large accelerator research centers were built, and the scattering of particles at high energies revealed a fascinating structure of matter. 
New particles, called gluons, were found to mediate the strong force. 
Their discovery should provide a clue to precise knowledge of the strong force. 
At short distances, gluons create an attractive force that is pretty weak and well understood. 
But, at larger distances, comparable to the proton radius, the force becomes really strong, and a very large number of gluons is involved, forming complicated structures that are not well known today. 
Therefore, for some time, it was not expected that the properties of the strong force could be directly derived from the properties of gluons. 
In the last few years, however, experiments at the HERA accelerator in Hamburg, Germany, have observed the strong interaction effects in slow motion, which could open a way to a precise understanding of the strong force. 
At the HERA accelerator, the scattering of electrons on protons was studied at the highest energies ever for this type of experiment. 
The HERA machine operated from 1992 until 2007. 
One of its most important discoveries was that several distinct phenomena observed at high energies and short distances could be clearly attributed to the emission of gluons and the emergence of gluonic structures. 
By observing how these structures change while increasing the distance, it should be possible to follow – and thus to understand –the action of the strong force. 
The appearance of such clear gluonic structures was unexpected; the experiments at HERA were not designed to study them. 
But the precision experiments required to measure the strong force can be designed and built with known technology. 
So two large groups of physicists – one concentrated around the Brookhaven and Jefferson National Laboratories in the United States, and the other around CERN in Geneva – are proposing to restart the investigation of electron-proton interactions. 
The study of these interactions should provide a precise understanding of the strong force. 
And, as the history of physics has shown, a better understanding of natural forces will open new, completely unexpected possibilities. 
For example, our understanding of electromagnetic force, developed mostly in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, gave rise to today’s breathtaking developments in telecommunications, computers, chemistry, and material sciences. 
A preciseunderstanding of the strong force could be just as important, opening new ways to use nuclear-energy resources while solving the problems of safety and nuclear waste. 
What’s Stopping Europe? 
PITTSBURGH – On a recent visit to Greece, French President François Hollande declared that Europe’s decline was over, and urged French companies to invest in Greece. 
Bad advice. 
French production costs are high, but Greek costs are higher. 
Despite the considerable decline in Greek (and Italian and Spanish) real GDP since 2007, adjustment is far from complete. 
In fact, one would be hard pressed to find broad agreement with Hollande’s assessment anywhere in Europe. 
Before the recent Italian election, financial markets showed signs of optimism, encouraged by the European Central Bank’s policy of guaranteeing eurozone members’ sovereign debt, expanding its balance sheet, and lowering interest rates. 
Bondholders gain when interest rates fall. 
But unemployment continues to rise in the heavily indebted southern countries, and output continues to lag behind Germany and other northern European countries. 
The main reason for the lag is not simply low demand or large debts. 
There is a vast difference between unit labor costs – real wages adjusted for productivity – in Germany and in the heavily indebted southern countries. 
When the crisis began, production costs in Greece were about 30% higher than in Germany, so Greece exported very little and imported very much. 
Production costs in other heavily indebted countries were 20-25% higher than in Germany. 
Growth will not resume until production costs in the indebted countries decline, which requires either a substantial permanent increase in productivity, a reduction in real wages, or both. 
While some adjustment has occurred, much of the change is not permanent. 
Austerity reduced the number of employed workers, particularly those with low skill and productivity levels. But gains in measured productivity growth from this source are not permanent changes, so a large part of the reported reductions in unit labor costs are temporary. 
Indeed, major cost differences remain. 
In Greece, the private sector has been forced to adjust, but the government failed to keep its promise to reduce public employment. 
That will prolong excessive government spending, and deficit targets will not be met on a sustained basis. 
Large reductions in public-sector wages brought down the primary deficit, but employment maintenance lowers productivity, raises costs, and delays adjustment. 
In Italy, former Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government undertook some reforms, but it continued to support unions and corporate monopolies. 
And Italy’s parliament rejected many of Monti’s proposed reductions in government spending. 
Labor and many product markets remain closed, despite the urgent need to increase competition, lower production costs, and raise productivity. 
After five years of slow growth and rising unemployment, voters in other indebted countries, like Italians (and French voters before them), are likely to reject additional spending reductions, tax increases, and further painful deregulation. 
Europe must find more effective policies that reduce production costs toward German levels. 
The economic historian Harold James has shown in a recent book that in the 40 years of negotiations leading to the adoption of the common currency, all of the problems that now beset the eurozone were discussed repeatedly. 
Everyone understood that a monetary union would require enforceable fiscal and banking rules. 
But such rules were never adopted. 
Before the euro, countries adjusted misaligned production costs by devaluing or revaluing their exchange rates. 
Fiscal austerity is a poor substitute. 
It works slowly, if at all, because elected governments are often reluctant to implement their promises – and may not feel bound by those of previous administrations (especially if they owe their victory to voters who are rebelling against years of belt-tightening with no evidence of renewed growth). 
Likewise, politicians are reluctant to adopt deregulation that eliminates state-sponsored special privileges. 
For several years, I have proposed a policy that combines growth and fiscal rectitude. 
Let all the heavily indebted southern European countries jointly agree to join a weak euro, which would float against the stronger northern euro. 
When the weak euro reduces the heavily indebted countries’ production costs by 20-25%, they can rejoin the “hard” euro if they accept fiscal reforms that are subject to approval by the European Commission (and thus by the hard-euro creditor countries). After all, a fixed exchange rate or common currency requires limits on fiscal independence. 
The Italian election sent a message. 
After five years of decline in living standards, voters oppose more austerity and further retrenchment without growth. 
Restoring a sound euro requires policies that revive growth, rein in government spending, and reform heavily regulated labor and product markets. 
The Structure of Institutional Reforms 
FRANKFURT – Despite abundant talk in Europe nowadays, there is no crisis of the euro. 
Some countries, instead, are dealing with a sovereign-debt crisis and the consequences of inadequate economic reform. 
The challenges are characteristic not only for the euro area. 
Most advanced economies around the globe are facing similar problems. 
All countries need to draw firm conclusions from the current crisis. 
In the euro area, instead of continuing to deny that monetary union limits national fiscal sovereignty, they must come to terms with economic reality and follow stricter budgetary rules. 
When the global financial crisis erupted, the euro shielded countries that in comparable circumstances would have been plunged into a deep currency crisis. 
This shield may, perhaps, have worked too well because the more weakly performing countries faced no discipline from financial markets. 
Indeed, despite massive imbalances and huge disparities in the level of private and public debt across the euro area, interest-rate spreads on government bonds disappeared in the run-up to the crisis. 
Market participants – including ratings agencies – either flagrantly misapprehended risk or never took the Maastricht Treaty’s no-bailout clause seriously. 
Meanwhile, the institutional mechanisms implemented for coordination of economic and fiscal policies remained idle. 
On the fiscal side, the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were even weakened, and the decisions on adjustment measures and possible sanctions became dependent on short-sighted political considerations. 
As long as Europe’s potential sinners continue to judge its de facto sinners, peer pressure will not work. 
Indeed, deficit-reduction programs were all too often founded on overly optimistic growth assumptions, and in times of robust economic growth, debt reduction was neglected. 
Reliable statistics were not available in all countries, and for years there was no political will to protect public budgets from the impact of rapidly aging populations on pension and health-care costs. 
All of these failures became fully manifest in 2005, when European governments watered down the Stability and Growth Pact’s rules to a degree that effectively made them optional. 
The European Central Bank was critical of that decision, whose dramatic consequences have exceeded our greatest fears. 
The financial crisis hit fragile public budgets with full force. 
The effect of automatic stabilizers in the economic downturn, state support for banks, and the fiscal stimulus packages adopted by governments all undermine fiscal sustainability. 
Financial markets’ sudden reappraisal of sovereign risk has now put euro-area governments under considerable pressure to reduce their deficits. 
But there is a risk that fiscal consolidation will wane as soon as a degree of deficit reduction has calmed the markets. 
To minimize that risk, euro-area countries must fundamentally re-work and strengthen the institutional architecture for coordinating long overdue structural reforms and for safeguarding public finances. 
These efforts will require far-reaching reforms. 
What is required is de-politicized fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance, stricter and more binding budgetary rules, smoother recourse to sanctions for breaching them, and close co-ordination of economic policies. 
De-politicization of surveillance is best achieved by creating an independent body, whether formal or informal, while stricter and more binding rules must include a stronger link between deficit and debt criteria. 
Indeed, reducing the current high debt levels in the euro area will require substantial consolidation. 
First, governments should bring fiscal deficits down to below 3% of GDP, in line with what has been agreed by the European Council. 
Second, to set high debt ratios on a diminishing path, governments will have to aim at reducing deficits further in line with their medium-term budgetary objectives. 
Sanctions, to be credible, must come into play long before a country falls into economic difficulties; therefore, they should not be purely financial in character, but should include other measures as well. 
Such sanctions should begin to be imposed when governments fail to meet minimum requirements for attaining medium-term objectives. 
They should then become incrementally more severe the longer and the more seriously the rules are breached. 
Where structural policy is concerned, we need a better architecture for overseeing and safeguarding individual countries’ competitiveness, and for eliminating imbalances. 
This calls for competitiveness to be monitored, and made subject to surveillance. 
Countries should be assigned to a risk group in line with their economic vulnerability. 
The higher the risk, the more binding the recommendations for the reduction of imbalances, the stricter the surveillance of how well appropriate measures are implemented, and the harsher the possible sanctions for continued rule violations. 
Some have proposed establishing a new institution for crisis management, which would most likely require a treaty change. 
But, if the reforms in the realm of fiscal policy and coordination of economic policy are successful, such an institution would never need to act, and would thus be redundant. 
Structural reforms and fiscal consolidation are, incidentally, tasks not only for countries with a current-account deficit. 
Of course, the pressure on these countries to act is particularly high, but there is no country in the euro area whose budgetary situation can be described as enduringly sound. 
Surplus countries, too, must adopt measures to strengthen the domestic economy by creating incentives for investment and employment. 
These adjustment measures are painful but necessary. 
Without structural reforms to strengthen employment and growth, even the most earnest efforts to foster recovery will come to nothing both economically and politically. 
The Struggle for Mastery in Iran 
TEHERAN: The trial of thirteen Iranian Jews on espionage charges is but the latest sign of a conservative backlash against Iran's reform movement, headed by President Mohammed Khatami. 
Conservatives want not only to silence the reformers, but to provoke confrontation. 
Closure of pro-reform newspapers, and the arrests of reform-minded journalists seem deliberate attempts to goad the reformers, who won a majority of seats in last February's first round of parliamentary elections. 
For if the reformers are incited into demonstrating and street chaos ensues, the security forces will have a handy excuse for a crackdown. 
In the state of emergency likely to follow, installation of a new parliament might be delayed. 
Recognizing this, reform leaders urge restraint on their supporters. 
They are confident about eventual triumph, because the majority of youth and women support reform. 
Two thirds of Iran's 65 million people are under 25 years old. 
But young people in Iran, as everywhere, are not known for patience. 
Here lies the threat of unrest. 
Tension is rife because, although the economy is a shambles, no one is doing anything about it. 
Those campaigning for reform are mostly interested in the social and political changes called for by President Khatami under the rubric of 'civil society' and the 'rule of law.' 
The President himself seems not very interested in economics. 
He should be. 
Unemployment is high, especially among young Iranians. 
Of the 1.9 million youngsters in higher education who are expected to enter the labour force over the next five years, 15.2% have no hope of employment. 
The total workforce will reach 17.7 million by the end of the current five-year plan, with 2.8 million or 15.8% unemployed. 
More than 50% of university graduates cannot find jobs, and now look abroad for work. 
Those who cannot go abroad form the base of the large number of educated young unemployed - a classic ingredient in causing public disorder. 
Growth is the only viable solution to all this, but it is nowhere to be seen amidst state controls and rampant corruption. 
This year's real GDP is expected to grow a mere 1.5%. 
Even for those in work, incomes are low - especially, in relative terms, for professionals. 
All Iranian factions blame today's economic crisis on the ruinous 1980-88 war with Iraq as well as on continued US sanctions. 
But the real cause is the inertia of state control. 
The Iranian economy is 80% state-owned (as provided in the revolutionary constitution - article 44) and prices of basic goods are controlled. 
Massive subsidies are needed to finance the raw material inputs of state companies, and these consume the bulk of the government's oil revenues (10% of GDP). 
Subsidies combined with a bloated civil service (there are over 2 million state employees) generate chronic budget deficits, estimated at 5% of GDP in 1998-99. 
Worse, the deficit is financed by printing money, fanning inflation, which reached 24% in 1998-99 and is rising. 
Inflation and unemployment will remain high until the government acquires the will and authority to carry through on structural reforms in the teeth of opposition from both the conservative/revolutionary establishment and the vested economic interests spawned by the revolution. 
Labour market liberalization is the most necessary reform. 
Existing labour laws (introduced after 1979) make it costly for employers to hire workers, who benefit from compulsory bonuses and generous severance payments. 
Another key target should be the bonyads (charitable foundations). 
Exempt from taxation, Bonyads and their regime-appointed directors are very wealthy, with vast powers over major industries. 
Another source of fiscal and economic distortion comes from the semi-official merchants, or bazaaris, whose businesses account for 10% of GDP, and who enjoy, together with various bureaucrats, special privileges such as access to hard currencies at special rates. 
Such distortions need to be replaced by investment, both from repatriated flight capital and foreign sources. 
Both should come, lured by the country's rich natural resources. 
But investment is impossible without privatization, to which the regime has an ideological allergy. 
Rapprochement with the outside world would help. 
Here, America is the key. 
But the hints of d‚tente with America that emerged since Khatami's inauguration could be undermined by domestic perceptions either of US intransigence (e.g. over sanctions) or that well-intended US engagement is interference in Iran's internal affairs. 
Seemingly balked on political reform, President Khatami should focus on economic renewal which, when it comes, might revive his political agenda too. 
The Struggle for Mastery of the Pacific 
TOKYO – On May 1, the Shanghai Expo began, illuminated by a huge fireworks display. 
The festivities will continue until the end of October. 
In 1970, Japan celebrated its own tremendous postwar economic growth with the Osaka Expo, as well as by launching the Bullet Train. 
The world watches and wonders whether China will follow Japan’s path and emerge as a fully modern yet peacefully inclined country. 
There are reasons to doubt that it will. 
China’s willingness to demonstrate its new might is not confined to land; on the contrary, China’s maritime ambitions have no end in sight. 
Indeed, when Admiral Timothy J. Keating, the commander of the United States Navy’s Pacific fleet, visited China in 2007, a high-ranking Chinese naval officer proposed that the two countries demarcate a “zone of control” at Hawaii, defining the limits of US naval influence and the beginning of China’s maritime sphere. 
The Chinese navy, it is now believed, is trying to achieve that very aim. 
China’s ambition is marked by muscle flexing. 
On April 8, a helicopter from a Chinese naval vessel operating in international waters south of Okinawa came within 90 meters of a Japanese Self-Defense Force escort ship – so close that a gun-wielding Chinese soldier was clearly visible. 
Japan protested, describing the incident as an “extremely dangerous act.” 
As if demonstrating its intention to ignore the protest, on April 21 Chinese Navy vessels sailed northward, between Okinawa and the Miyako islands, and conducted a large-scale exercise. 
Once again, a Chinese military helicopter circled a Japanese escort ship. 
Although reconnaissance flights by Russia’s Air Force frequently occur in Japan’s northern skies, both countries understand the need for caution in their actions. 
The Japanese and Chinese militaries, however, do not have sufficient ties to create confidence that caution will prevail. 
To prevent an accident from inciting a volatile incident, it is imperative that the two sides develop a deeper bilateral military dialogue. 
Nothing of the sort is happening. 
Moreover, Japan’s government has encouraged Chinese regional ambitions by embracing an anti-American attitude similar to the administration of South Korea’s former president, Roh Moo-hyun. 
By promising in last summer’s election campaign to expel America’s bases on Okinawa, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama put himself in a bind. 
It now appears that he wants to backtrack on his promise, but massive protests are inhibiting him from doing so. 
Sensing a widening gulf between Japan and the US, the Chinese Navy is demonstrating its growing might in the seas around Japan – and asserting its aspiration to replace the US as the Pacific’s dominant naval power. 
There is a precedent for this: when the US closed Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, the Chinese military immediately stepped up its activity around the Spratly Islands, which are recognized as Filipino territory but which China is claiming vehemently. 
China’s struggle for mastery in the Pacific is now raising fears in Japan. 
South of Okinawa is Yonaguni Island, with a population of just 1,800 and visible from Taiwan on a clear day. 
Within Japan, there is growing controversy over the Hatoyama government’s push for a law that would allow particular foreign residents on the island to vote in local elections. 
The inhabitants of Yonaguni strongly oppose the law, not because they are exclusionary, but because they believe that they are protecting a sensitive border. 
Because a mere 137 votes can get a town council member elected, a large number of foreigners with a particular interest in moving onto the island could nominate a winning candidate. 
The worry is that such a council could legislate in ways “friendly” to neighboring states, which might compromise Japan’s national security dramatically. 
Even Hatoyama’s defense minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, who had been prone to naïve remarks on the issue, appears to have come to his senses. 
He is now calling for the construction of a Self-Defense Force base on Yonaguni. 
But the situation on the island demonstrates anew that China is prepared to take advantage of every misstep that the gaffe-prone Hatoyama government makes. 
And it is not just the waters near Japan that should concern Hatoyama, for the Chinese Navy is not only eyeing the Pacific, but also steering toward South Asia, the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, and Africa. 
Indeed, the growing contest between India and China is not only military in nature, but also concerns the acquisition of natural resources. 
By controlling the sea lanes, China hopes to gain leverage over India’s capacity for economic growth. 
Chinese military expansion has seen double-digit annual growth for 22 years. 
Although Chinese officials say that the 2010 military budget has been restrained, and will grow by only 7.5%, China’s military expenditures already exceeds those of Japan by 15%. 
In fact, China probably limited the increase this year after recognizing that the international community is becoming alarmed by the steep upward trajectory of its military build-up. 
But there remain doubts about the true level of China’s military spending, owing to a pronounced lack of transparency in the budget process. 
It remains unclear, for example, whether the research and development costs for an aircraft carrier are included. 
History has repeatedly demonstrated that such ambiguity, particular if practiced by a rising power, can spark an arms race. 
The secretive naval build-up of Kaiser Wilhelm II’s Germany, for example, helped incite World War I. US President John F. Kennedy’s belief that a “missile gap” existed in the Soviet Union’s favor inspired the production of multiple-warhead nuclear missiles, accelerating the nuclear arms race at the height of the Cold War. 
China claims that it is entitled to play a role in setting the rules that govern the international system. 
China should, of course, play such a part. 
But until China acts with greater sincerity and transparency in eliminating the international community’s concerns, it runs the risk that its neighbors will not only suspect its efforts in the international arena, but take active countermeasures to defend their security. 
The Struggle for Syria 
CAIRO – As the violence in Syria mounts, the international community’s paralysis has become increasingly jarring. 
But the role of external regional forces is almost as important in fueling the domestic bloodshed as what is happening internally. 
If Syria could break free of the negative influences of regional politics, genuine change without continued violence might become possible. 
Syria needs to manage its diverse ethnic and religious composition, and to decide its own position on the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
But that is more difficult when neighboring countries are exploiting the country's heterogeneous makeup to pursue their own hegemonic agendas. 
Syria, after all, sits at the center of mighty and antagonistic geopolitical forces. 
To the east looms Iran, with its anti-American, anti-Western rhetoric and vast regional ambitions. 
To the south sits Saudi Arabia, with its long friendship with the United States and its inherent hostility toward Iran's Islamic Republic. 
And to the north is Turkey, a pro-European, largely secular and democratic country that seeks to wield influence across the Arab world. 
The region in and around Syria is also populated by extremist Islamist groups that are attempting to expand their spheres of influence - and that are quick to capitalize on instability in any country. 
Syria is particularly vulnerable in this regard, as extremists incite violence against minority religious groups by using, for example, television stations in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. 
The current regime in Syria, in its ruthless quest to remain in power, refuses to acknowledge peaceful protesters' demands for freedom and dignity. 
If it did - and if it met those demands - Islamists would not be able to hijack the demonstrations. 
Peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved, and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country's “complexity” does nothing for its people. 
In fact, the obsession with Syria's sectarian rivalries provides destabilizing external forces with the oxygen that their inflammatory rhetoric requires. 
The incitement against Syrian religious minorities promulgated by extremist TV stations, and by people like the Chief Justice of Saudi Arabia's Supreme Judicial Council, coupled with equally damaging behavior by Iran, if left unchecked, could result in an even worse bloodbath, with Syria's people drawn into a war of all against all. 
The international community allowed change in Tunisia and Egypt to proceed at those countries' own pace. 
In Syria, a Libyan-style military intervention is not warranted, but diplomatic intervention is needed to allow the country's people to determine its future. 
The international community's goal must be to persuade neighboring countries to halt their brazen, unwarranted attacks on parts of Syrian society. 
In particular, the US, which has significant influence in Saudi Arabia, must act to stop attacks by that country's extremists on Syria's religious minorities - attacks motivated merely by a desire to provoke sectarian conflict. 
Likewise, efforts to weaken Iran's disruptive influence in the region must be maintained, while Turkey's regional ambitions must be kept in mind. 
Optimism about the Syrian people's future must be tempered by realism about the challenges facing Syria's opposition movement and the international community alike. 
Dramatic, rapid change could result in prolonged failure. 
Fortunately, Syrians have no predilection for violence. 
For them, peaceful, gradual change is the best option. 
And that requires a national dialogue, overseen by the international community, aimed at bolstering internal unity – and thus at protecting the country from regional interference. 
The situation in Syria is usually – and rightly – described as an intricate, multi-dimensional playing field with a wide variety of political actors and competing interests. 
But there has been an inadequate focus on the Syrian people’s simple desire for genuine reform, greater personal freedom, and more economic opportunity. 
Syrians have experienced uninterrupted dictatorship for 40 years, and, with it, extreme economic hardship, including high unemployment, rising food prices, and endemic corruption. 
They are also now suffering from water shortages and a budget deficit that has been exacerbated by declining oil revenues. 
But Syrians are a remarkably resilient, resourceful people, as well as being young and well educated 
With international assistance in developing Syria’s democratic institutions and political infrastructure, we can build a robust civil society that can assert its own identity and sovereignty, independent of undue outside influence. 
A new Syria, based on democratic principles, would not only benefit Syrians, but would be a force for stability throughout the region. 
The Sugar Season 
The holiday season that is now upon us is a time for festivity, and usually of overeating. 
But the rampant consumption of sugar that marks this time of year is nothing to celebrate. 
In fact, this seasonal upsurge in sugar consumption is just part of a huge transition in world health that is now underway. 
Many countries, especially developing countries, are facing the consequences of huge changes in lifestyle: modifications in diet, lower levels of physical activity, and increased tobacco use. 
These changes are determined, to a large extent, by the globalization and expansion of food markets, and by ever-greater levels of urbanization. 
Both of these factors incite sedentary behavior at home and at work, as well as profound alterations in dietary habits. 
So it should be no surprise that noncommunicable diseases (NCD's), including cardiovascular diseases (CVD's), obesity, diabetes and cancer, now kill roughly 33 million people around the world each year, and cause almost 60% of total deaths. 
Indeed, they account for almost half the global burden of disease. 
By 2020, that contribution is expected to rise to 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden of disease. 
Moreover, more than 60% these deaths occur in the developing world, and here NCD's increasingly appear in younger age groups, which can have huge implications for how productive a country's workers are. 
Recent data from China reflect the extent of the problem. 
In China's rural areas, with more than 800 million people, NDC's account for more than 80% of deaths. 
Many countries are now afflicted by a double burden of diseases. 
Countries that still struggle with malnutrition and illnesses like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, now must contend with an explosion of CVD's, diabetes, and obesity, as well as soaring rates of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. 
Indeed, five of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide are related to diet and physical activity: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low intake of fruit and vegetables, high body mass index, and insufficient exercise. 
Clearly, effective strategies to tackle the NCD burden require a critical examination of what people are eating and their levels of physical activity. 
The World Health Organization, together with a group of international experts, has developed a global strategy on diet, physical activity, and health over a period of 18 months through an extensive series of consultations in more than 80 countries, and with the input of United Nations bodies, civic groups, and food producers. 
One of the strategy's key conclusions is that reducing the burden of NCD's requires a multi-sectoral approach. 
Like a toolbox, the strategy provides WHO members with a comprehensive range of policy options from which to choose. 
Governments can act. 
Transport ministries should provide safe roads so that children can bike to school. 
Finance ministers could tax unhealthy food and subsidize healthy food. 
Education ministers should demand healthy school meals. 
Many countries are already developing their own national strategies. 
Most of what WHO is recommending has been endorsed by public health officials for many years. 
But we face a global problem, with many international stakeholders, and this requires an urgent and worldwide response. 
Of course, there is considerable debate about what precisely makes for a healthy diet. 
This debate is both welcome and to be expected; improving diet and finding ways to increase physical activity is a complex issue. 
Moreover. there will always be groups with their own interests, using arguments that we do not have sufficient evidence to act. 
But there has been no challenge to the strategy's recommendations from the global scientific or public health community. 
The strongest critique has come from sugar associations, who claim that the upper limit of 10% on caloric intake from sugar is not based upon scientific evidence. 
However, more than twenty national and international reports from around the world by scientific bodies governing dietary recommendations set similar or lower targets for sugar intake. 
The growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health. 
The implementation of the WHO's strategy could lead to one of the largest-ever positive shifts in human health, putting populations throughout the world on pathways to lifelong and sustained improvements in well-being. 
The Suicide of Hong Kong 
China has been celebrating the five year anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland from British rule. 
Firecrackers, dragon dancers, and President Jiang Zemin's visit marked the festivities. 
Now that China's rulers have returned to Beijing, it is time to take a more realistic look at what those five years have wrought. 
Hong Kong's ruling elite delights in telling foreign visitors how wrong pessimistic predictions of the territory's have proven to be. 
Fortune, for example, once entitled a cover story "The Death of Hong Kong." 
That article forecast heavy-handed meddling by Beijing in local affairs, which would allegedly emasculate the vitality of Hong Kong's economy. 
The article was wrong, because Hong Kong's deepest wounds have not come from China's ruler, but are self-inflicted. 
Tung Chee Hwa, Hong Kong's leader, insists that the "one country, two systems" scheme devised by Deng Xiaoping works perfectly. 
The Financial Secretary, Anthony Leung, last year boasted that Hong Kong would become Asia's "Manhattan Plus." 
Chief Secretary Sir Donal Tsang calls negative assessments of the territory the product of second-rate minds. 
But official bravura has little sympathy beyond this narrow circle. 
Among Hong Kong's public, there is a pervasive feeling that it has changed for the worse since 1997 -- not as a result of overweening interference from Beijing, but due to worrisome decisions made by local rulers. 
Mr. Tung, the scion of a shipping empire, and his tycoon friends like to blame Britain's colonial government for leaving behind "time bombs" that make Hong Kong look bad. 
In 1998, for example, the government led a chorus blaming the British for the property price bubble that was punctured by Asia's financial crisis of 1997, causing the stock market to fall sharply. 
But the bubble was really manufactured by China's communist rulers over a decade earlier on the advice of local property magnates, who wanted to limit the amount of land British colonials were permitted to sell. 
Local officials soon began to broaden their attack. 
In 1999, the government sought and received the Beijing government's direct intervention to overturn a decision by Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeals on an immigration issue because the verdict did not please the government. 
Humbled and humiliated, the Court has acted timidly since. 
Locals now call it the "Court of Semi-Final Appeals." 
In 2000, one of Mr. Tung's political aides called on the president of the prestigious University of Hong Kong to express concern over a faculty member's opinion polls, which consistently recorded Mr. Tung's declining popularity. 
Soon after the meeting, senior university officials warned the pollster that further funding for his work might not be forthcoming. 
Robert Kuok, the Malaysian owner of Hong Kong's major English language newspaper, the South China Morning Post , is one of Mr. Tung's friends and fiercely loyal to China's leaders. 
In 2001, the journalist Willy Lam, a respected China expert, was sacked from the paper after Mr Kuok publicly berated him for his views on China's rulers. 
President Jiang and China's rulers have had very little, if anything, to do with any of these decisions. 
They were taken because Mr. Tung and his allies wish to demonstrate how in tune they are with official thinking on the mainland. 
But are they in tune? 
The presumption that China wants Hong Kong to become more like the mainland is ludicrous. 
China has had entirely too much of the "one country." 
What it wants now is the "two systems." 
China's search for an alternative social and economic arrangement became urgent with the student revolt of 1989, the subsequent Tienanmien massacre, and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. 
The Chinese communist party knew it had a legitimacy problem, and the driving idea behind Deng's ingenuous formula was to allow Hong Kong to show China a short cut to prosperity. 
True, China's ruling elite remains a Leninist party prepared to crush all potential threats to its monopoly of power. 
Yet many officials working directly under the party leaders are earnestly scrutinizing western countries for institutional details that might shed light on what China can do for itself in the future. 
In other words, China is looking for a new system to replace the existing one. 
Mr. Tung, whose moral precepts are informed by a doctrinaire interpretation of Confucian classics emphasizing obedience to one's superiors, seems oblivious to what China views as the fundamental challenge that it now faces. 
Instead, his behavior is reminiscent of a feudal district official whose main priority is to ensure that his superiors are treated with due reverence. 
Nor is Mr. Tung alone. 
Much of Hong Kong's elite shares the same mindset, despite their training in Western business schools and their fortunes gained from property trading. 
Their priority is to nurture a cozy relationship with Chinese officialdom -- much of which can be easily bought. 
Whether Hong Kong remains an open, liberal society has never been a major issue for them. 
One senior Chinese cadre doing graduate work at Harvard recently uttered in amazement that Hong Kong, with its leaders acquiescing dutifully in every inane utterance by China's rulers, struck him as more "leftist" than the mainland. 
Indeed, many Chinese officials privately laugh at Mr. Tung and his cronies sycophantic behavior and are increasingly confident that the mainland has nothing to learn from Hong Kong's example. 
What China regards as Hong Kong's comedy of deference is quickly becoming a tragedy of errors for Hong Kong's citizens. 
The Summit of Low Expectations 
SAN DIEGO – In the run-up to President Barack Obama’s first visit to China next month, American and Chinese diplomats have been compiling lists of ongoing cooperative endeavors in case no new agreements materialize. 
Indeed, that outcome appears likely. 
The problem is as much the fault of the United States as it is of the Chinese. 
Whereas agreements require hard work on both sides, the Americans are having a difficult time negotiating their country’s domestic political obstacles in time to engage effectively with China. 
With the Copenhagen climate summit only weeks away, forging a commitment on climate change is the most pressing challenge. 
The US and China are the world’s two biggest emitters of carbon dioxide. 
Obama administration officials had been hoping that bilateral cooperation to tackle this common threat might deepen the US-China partnership in the same way that the common Soviet threat brought Nixon and Mao together in 1972. 
If Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao could agree about what actions their countries would take, and what explicit commitments they would make as part of a global agreement, the rest of the world would follow. 
Unfortunately, the two countries stand on opposing sides on climate change. 
China speaks for the developing world in demanding to be let off the hook from committing to a specific national carbon-reduction target. 
The US, Europe, and other industrialized states caused the problem, the Chinese say, so they bear the most responsibility for solving it. 
On the ground, Chinese actions to address climate change are impressive. 
China has undertaken a nationwide campaign to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20% by 2010, and will hold local officials accountable for achieving the targets. 
Moreover, the Chinese have built up wind and solar power so quickly that they have just increased their goal for renewable sources to 15% of total power generation by 2020. 
But, as a matter of national pride, the Chinese refuse to articulate an international commitment under duress, and Obama doesn’t have much standing in pressing China to compromise, since the US Congress hasn’t yet acted on cap-and-trade legislation. 
Without any credible commitments by America, how can Obama ask China to do more? 
The best that can be hoped for are serious joint research and development projects, such as collaboration on carbon capture and sequestration, aimed at demonstrating that both leaders are at least pulling in the same direction in addressing climate change. 
Because both countries want to avoid being blamed for scuttling a global agreement, they will work together to make their modest plans look as substantial as possible and promise to do more after Copenhagen. 
China’s diplomatic self-confidence has been buoyed by its being the first country to recover from the global economic crisis – thanks to a massive and early infusion of government and bank investment that stimulated demand. 
The Chinese acknowledge that they enabled Americans to borrow and spend beyond their means by parking China’s massive foreign reserves in US government securities. 
But they refuse to accept that this was the root cause of the crisis. 
To the Chinese, as well as to others, it is obvious that the main cause of the crisis was America’s flawed financial system. 
In fact, both sides should be working to recalibrate their bilateral imbalances: Americans should spend less and save more, and Chinese should spend more and save less. 
But if Obama presses Hu to revalue the Chinese currency as the best way to achieve recalibration, Hu is likely to push back, asking Obama what he intends to do to stem the massive US deficits that will cause inflation and reduce the value of investments by Chinese and others in American securities. 
Neither side will volunteer to bear the costs of recalibrating the relationship. 
As a result, the summit will most likely produce sincere pledges to work together to stimulate the global recovery and adjust the two sides’ economic imbalances – but not much more. 
As for North Korea, Obama and Hu will agree on the importance of bringing the regime back to the Six-Party Talks and affirming its commitments to denuclearize, and the summit communiqué will emphasize this common stance. 
But, beneath the surface, clear differences in strategy will emerge. 
Hu will urge Obama to resume bilateral talks with North Korea under the Six-Party umbrella; and he may press China’s position that, in the long term, economic engagement is more effective than sanctions in changing North Korea’s behavior. 
Indeed, Chinese trade and investment are spurring market activity in North Korea’s northern region. 
Based on their own experience over the past 30 years, the Chinese know how economic reform and liberalization can change a country’s perception of its self-interests and stance toward the world. 
Why not reach out to North Korea the way you are toward Iran and Burma, Hu may ask Obama? 
The US and China could work together to organize managerial and development training for North Koreans and encourage the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to start providing technical advice. 
A report by the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation and the Asia Society makes the case for economic engagement with North Korea as a long-term strategy that would complement the sanctions now in place. 
But the US Congress might well cry “appeasement” if Obama dared to propose engaging – and changing – North Korea in this way. 
Hu and Obama will work hard to present an image of unity during the summit. 
Both sides want to prevent any serious rupture. 
But substantive agreements on climate change, the financial crisis, or North Korea would require both countries to take actions that could be domestically costly. 
The era when China made all the compromises in the relationship has passed. 
The Sunflower Revolutionary 
LONDON – The grim news that Ai Weiwei, perhaps China’s most famous contemporary artist, has been arrested and jailed – his family and friends have not seen or heard from him since – makes me think anew about Ai’s 100 million hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds, now being exhibited at London’s Tate Modern Gallery. 
China’s people, Ai’s installation seems to imply, are like the millions of seeds spread across the Tate’s gargantuan entrance hall. 
No one cares whether they are humiliated or crushed under foot (as the seeds were allowed to be at the exhibition’s opening). 
Unfortunately, Ai has become one of the seeds, his freedom crushed by the heel of an inhuman state. 
The Chinese official newspaper Global Times denounces Ai as a “maverick,” and mavericks are not tolerated in China. 
The only way for a Chinese individual to survive is to adopt the grey, anonymous way of the sunflower seed. 
According to a short item published by the official Xinhua news agency, Ai has allegedly been involved in so-called “economic crimes,” which could mean practically anything that the Marxist/Maoist minds of the leadership care to dream up. 
In fact, China’s government has yet to decide whether to prosecute Ai for economic crimes or for being “maverick.” 
Either way, the outside world must not be allowed to have any idea as to what fate awaits Ai. 
But the true reason for Ai’s arrest is obvious. 
When the police stormed Ai’s workshop, they demanded that Ai’s wife, Lu Qing, tell them, “What did Ai write on the Internet?” 
In the Chinese government’s view, an artist who dares to speak for the “sunflower seeds” and cultivate an independent mind is a direct security threat. 
He must be put under control, silenced. 
Of course, the ruling Chinese Communist Party is prefabricating Ai’s prosecution. 
It is as if three decades after China’s “opening,” nothing has changed in the Party’s way of thinking and ruling. 
Ai graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1978, but he learned and developed his artistic talents in the United States. 
His Shanghai workshop used to be a salon for Chinese artists, including the film directors Chen Kaige and Jiang Wen. 
But Ai never allowed himself to be hired as an official regime hack. 
Instead, he remained an outspoken, independent man, ready to speak and take action whenever art and ideals confronted repression and cruelty. 
With China’s regime now gripped by fear of an Arab-style revolution, the government has chosen repression as the only means to “maintain stability.” 
On the day of Ai’s arrest, former Global Times journalist Wen Tao was grabbed off the street in broad daylight. 
Before that, the writers Ran Yunfei, Teng Biao, Ye Du, Zhu Yufu, Tang Jingling, Gu Chuan, Li Hai, Ding Mao, Chen Wei, Jiang Tianyong, and Liu Zhengqing were separately detained or sentenced to jail. 
Other young Beijing artists have been detained as well. 
To be sure, the regime considers Ai’s arrest a preemptive measure to prevent the outbreak of public demonstrations. 
But Ai never participated in the many Internet appeals for such protests. 
And his arrest seems to be just the beginning. 
The next targets will likely be independent writers like Ai Xiaoming, Dai Qing, Cui Weiping, and Han Han. 
The regime will not stop the persecution until the only voices to be heard are its own “official” artists. 
Ai’s arrest and disappearance, along with the severe prison sentence imposed on the Noble Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, are driven by the same motivation: to dam the potential for political unrest and purge independent intellectuals. 
This process is nothing new. 
The writer Li Hong received a six-year prison sentence and died in a hospital under police supervision last year. 
Another writer, Li Xianbin, was sentenced to 10 years. 
According to the Writers in Prison Committee of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, more than 30 of the country’s writers are currently locked up. 
China’s relentless economic rise is bringing with it a decadence of civilization. 
The feast of new wealth is accompanied by a famine of morality. 
So when global leaders behave like conniving hucksters to do business with this new China’s rulers, they betray the values and principles that are the basis of democracy. 
Ai used to argue that the Chinese regime’s despotism is boosted by shameless liars. 
He always understood that true art and politics can never march hand-in-hand. 
They must eventually confront each other on the field of a free conscience. 
The “Arab awakening” tells something else about those sunflower seeds at the Tate Modern: the seeds, once they come together, show their unity and power. 
That is the other lesson that Ai wanted his audiences to understand, and it is why his spirit and message cannot be crushed: there are 1.3 billion seeds with him. 
The Sustainability Mindset 
MILAN – Markets and capitalist incentives have great strengths in promoting economic efficiency, growth, and innovation. 
And, as Ben Friedman of Harvard University argued persuasively in his 2006 book The Moral Consequences of Growth, economic growth is good for open and democratic societies. 
But markets and capitalist incentives have clear weaknesses in ensuring stability, equity, and sustainability, which can adversely affect political and social cohesion. 
Obviously, abandoning market-capitalist systems, and implicitly growth, is not really an option. 
Collectively, we have little choice but to try to adapt the system to changing technological and global conditions in order to achieve stability, equity (in terms of opportunity and outcomes alike), and sustainability. 
Of these three imperatives, sustainability may be the most complex and challenging. 
For many people, sustainability is associated with finite natural resources and the environment. 
The global economy will probably triple in size in the next quarter-century, largely owing to growth in developing countries as they catch up to developed-country incomes and adopt similar consumption patterns. 
Thus, there is a well-founded fear that the planet’s natural resources (broadly defined) and recuperative capacities will not withstand the pressure. 
To some, this logic leads to the conclusion that growth is the problem, and that less growth is the solution. 
But, in developing countries, where only sustained growth can lift people out of poverty, limiting it cannot be the answer. 
The alternative is to change the growth model in order to lighten the impact of higher levels of economic activity on natural resources and the environment. 
But there is no existing alternative to which we can all switch. 
Changing the growth model means inventing a new one over time, step-by-step, from complementary parts. 
The two key ingredients seem to be education and values. 
Everyone, not just policymakers, needs to understand the consequences of our individual and collective choices. 
We need to be aware for example, that population growth and rising consumption levels have intergenerational consequences, and that how we conduct ourselves will affect the lifestyles and opportunities of our children and grandchildren. 
Thus far, the quality of our choices has been unimpressive, reflecting little sensitivity to sustainability and the impact of our choices on future generations. 
As a result, many developed countries have built up dangerously large public debts and even larger non-debt liabilities, owing to unsustainable growth patterns. 
Most of us, I believe, do not knowingly make choices that adversely affect future generations. 
So perhaps incomplete knowledge of the consequences of our choices is responsible. 
Moreover, an unfunded liability path, once taken, is hard to leave, because at the point of departure, some generation is paying for past commitments and at least beginning to fund future ones. 
That seems unfair, because it is. 
Most people might agree that living beyond our means in the aggregate, via unfunded social services and insurance, or disproportionate use of resources, imposes a burden on our offspring. 
But we might still fail to reach agreement on who should pay for funding these programs, or for reducing our consumption of resources. 
Too often, it is easier to deal with the distributional problem by shifting the burden to those who are not present, and who are insufficiently represented by those who are. 
Education and values are the foundation of sound individual and, ultimately, collective choices. 
Without them, the incentives and policies that economists rightly argue are needed to increase energy efficiency, limit carbon emissions, economize on water usage, and much more will lack support and fail in the democratic decision-making process. 
If sustainability is to triumph, it must be predominantly a bottom-up process. 
Environmentalists are right to focus on education and individual choices, even when their policy proposals are not always on target. 
Education and values will drive local innovation, alter lifestyles, and shift social norms. 
They will also affect business behavior via choices by customers and employees, including business leaders. 
Thus, they are essential components of the formulas needed to pursue sustainable patterns of growth. 
But, while education and values are necessary, they clearly are not sufficient. 
Complementary national policies and international agreements will require careful scientific and economic analysis and thoughtful choices. 
The need for burden-sharing, particularly between advanced and developing countries, will not magically disappear. 
Climate-change risks, though serious, should not be mistaken for the entire sustainability agenda. 
There are clear steps that can be taken. 
Appropriate regulation and sufficiently long time horizons can make structures of all kinds much more energy-efficient, without imposing burdensome costs. 
In a similar way, transportation can become less energy-intensive without restricting mobility. 
Some of these shifts might be subject to international coordination, in order to avoid adverse competitive consequences, whether real or perceived. 
But too much coordination can be a bad thing. 
That is why climate-change negotiations are shifting from the misguided objective of seeking risky 50-year commitments to binding carbon-emissions targets to focusing on parallel, step-by-step processes, including higher energy efficiency, better urban planning, improved transportation systems, and on learning as we go. 
Likewise, businesses and industries that are heavy water users will simply develop new technologies and thrive in the face of scarcity. 
Progress has been helped by growing awareness in populous Asia – and in developing countries generally – that sustainability is the key to achieving their longer-term growth objectives. 
This perspective perhaps comes more naturally in an environment of rapid growth, because their growth models require continual review and adaptation to be sustainable. 
Over time, values shift as knowledge is acquired and disseminated. 
Policies aimed at sustainability are likely to follow. 
What is unknown is whether we will reach that point fast enough to avoid major disruptions, or even potential conflict. 
The Suzuki Alliance 
TOKYO – The name “Suzuki” is the most popular surname in Japan and the brand name of the most popular car in India. 
Suzuki has a market share of 55.6% in the compact and mid-size car market in India, whose middle class, car purchasing public, accounts for 200-300 million of the country’s 1.15 billion people. 
For a long time, Indians have used bicycle rickshaws or auto rickshaws for daily transportation. 
The word “rickshaw” originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha, which literally means “human-powered vehicle.” 
The fact that Suzuki is now practically synonymous with automobile in India suggests how close the relationship between the two countries can be. 
Indeed, India and Japan are natural allies. 
Their strategic interests are almost perfectly aligned, and each shares a desire to stabilize and preserve Asia’s balance of power. 
So it is no surprise that Japan is pushing to develop closer economic and strategic ties with India. 
Suzuki Motor Corporation first entered the Indian market in 1982, when it started a joint venture with Maruti Udyog, an Indian state-owned firm. 
Despite many ups and downs – and fierce competition from other major automobile manufacturers, including the Indian giant Tata Motors – Suzuki succeeded in establishing its brand as India’s “people’s car.” 
Currently, Maruti Suzuki India Limited has more than 4,000 employees and a nationwide sales network of 337 dealers with 8,600 salespersons. 
The company is planning to build a new factory in 2011, with production capacity of 300,000 cars per year for a market expected to reach two million in sales this year. 
The reason why Suzuki entered the Indian market is clear. 
Suzuki chose an untapped market while Japan’s bigger automakers – Toyota, Nissan, and Honda – engaged in fierce competition within Japan. 
Osamu Suzuki, CEO and COO of the company (and a grandson-in-law of its founder), is a creative decision maker, a maverick who considers himself an “old man in a mom-and-pop company” that concentrated most of its resources on producing motorcycles and light motor vehicles. 
Yet when he decided to diversify and focus on India, many criticized him as being reckless, because India was so unfamiliar to Japanese companies. 
Indeed, while there are currently more than 19,000 Japanese companies in the Chinese market, there are only about 260 in India. 
Suzuki’s decision to enter the Indian market turned out to be a resoundingly wise choice. 
Japan’s population peaked in 2004 and is now falling, while its younger generations show diminishing interests in automobiles. 
In the past, young Japanese were proud of their knowledge about cars, and every teenage boy knew which model would attract the most girls. 
Today, however, Japanese driving schools suffer from a fall-off in students, which cannot be explained solely by declining population. 
India’s population, on the other hand, is increasing dramatically in the absence of a one-child policy, such as exists in China. 
It makes sense, then, that Japanese companies should head to the expanding Indian market. 
Doing so, moreover, makes geo-strategic sense as well, with successive Japanese governments increasingly regarding India as a vital diplomatic and political partner. 
For example, in August 2007, then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe headed a big delegation to India, followed by an official visit in December 2009 by current Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. 
The “Strategic and Global Partnership between Japan and India,” established in 2006, rests on the recognition that Japan and India share common values and interests, as they are the two major entrenched democratic countries in Asia. 
These shared values distinguish the Japan-India relationship from Japan’s relationship with China. 
The growing congruence of strategic interests led to the 2008 Japan-India security agreement, a significant milestone in building a stable geo-political order in Asia. 
A constellation of Asian democracies linked by strategic cooperation and common interests is becoming critical to ensuring equilibrium at a time when Asia’s security challenges are mounting due to the shift in global economic and political power from west to east. 
The emerging Japan/India partnership looks like a necessary foundation for pan-Asian security in the 21st century. 
The key point today is that the governments in both India and Japan are keen on developing their strategic consensus about Asia’s future, a fact underscored by the many bilateral discussions between defense and military officials of both countries that are taking place. 
These discussions include joint initiatives on maritime security, counterterrorism, weapons proliferation, disaster prevention and management, and energy security. 
More is needed. 
India and Japan should, for example, jointly develop new defense capacities. 
Today, India and Japan cooperate on missile defense in partnership with Israel and the US. 
Bilateral efforts should also be launched to develop other defense technologies. 
Suzuki’s joint venture in India suggests that cooperation in high-tech manufacturing is eminently possible. 
Suzuki’s success is a powerful precedent not only for other Japanese companies that are looking at the Indian market, but also for further deepening cooperation between the two countries. 
Osamu Suzuki may not be willing to share all of the secrets of his success with his competitors, but they and Japanese diplomats should be studying the Suzuki method. 
Japan’s economy and Asian security depend on its replication. 
The Swedenization of Europe 
Anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are becoming linked and ever more rabid in today's Europe. 
They arise from a kind of blindness, combined with a strange mixture of alienation, guilt, and fear toward both Israel and America. 
Millions of Europeans resist seeing Israel as a country fighting for its survival. 
Israel cannot afford to lose one major war, as it would mean the end of the Jewish democratic state. 
But huge numbers of Europeans believe that something is fundamentally wrong with the Israelis: they never compromise; they prefer using military means to solve political problems. 
Something similar is at work in the European attitude to the US. 
Look at Europe, many Europeans say, we have eradicated wars, dangerous nationalism, and dictatorships. 
We created a peaceful European Union. 
We do not wage war; we negotiate. 
We do not exhaust our resources on weapons. 
The rest of the planet should learn from us how to live together without terrorizing each other. 
As a Swede, I have heard such pacific boasting all my life: that neutral Sweden is a moral superpower. 
Now this bragging has become the EU's ideology. 
We are the moral continent. 
Call this the "Swedenization" of Europe. 
Yes, today's EU is a miracle for a continent where two modern totalitarian movements - Communism and Nazism - unleashed rivers of blood. 
But what Europe forgets is how those ideologies were overcome. 
Without the US Army, Western Europe would not have been liberated in 1945. 
Without the Marshall Plan and NATO, it would not have taken off economically. 
Without the policy of containment under America's security umbrella, the Red Army would have strangled the dream of freedom in Eastern Europe, or brought European unity, but under a flag with red stars. 
West Europeans also forget that some areas of the world have never known freedom. 
In many places, torture chambers are the rules of the game, not the grotesque and shameful mistakes of ill-supervised troops. 
Any attempt in such places to go behave the European way and negotiate - without the military power needed to back up diplomacy - would be pathetic. 
Instead of supporting those who fight international terrorism, many Europeans try to blame the spread of terrorism on Israel and the US. 
This is a new European illusion. 
Spain's latter day appeasement à la Munich arises from this thinking. 
But what if Spain - and Europe as a whole - had reacted in the opposite way to the Madrid train bombing of April, saying: "We promise that because of that slaughter we will double our support for stabilization in Iraq by sending twice as many troops, experts, engineers, teachers, policemen, doctors, and billions of euros in support of allied forces and their Iraqi co-workers." 
The triumph of terrorists would have been transformed into a triumph of the war on terror. 
The images many Europeans hold of America and Israel create the political climate for some very ugly bias. 
You have the Great Satan and the Small Satan. 
America wants to dominate the world - exactly the allegations made in traditional anti-Semitic rhetoric about the Jews. 
Indeed, modern anti-Zionist rhetoric portrays Israel's goal as domination of the whole Middle East. 
Such ideas are reflected in opinions polls in which Europeans claim that Israel and the US are the true dangers to world peace. 
Ian Buruma, the British writer, claims that this European rage against America and Israel has to do with guilt and fear. 
The two world wars led to such catastrophic carnage that "never again" was interpreted as "welfare at home, non-intervention abroad." 
The problem with this concept is that it could only survive under the protection of American might. 
Extreme anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism are actually merging. 
The so-called peace poster "Hitler Had Two Sons: Bush and Sharon," displayed in European anti-war rallies, combines trivialization of Nazism with demonization of both the victims of Nazism and those who defeated Nazism. 
Much of this grows from a subconscious European guilt related to the Holocaust. 
Now the Holocaust's victims - and their children and grandchildren - are supposedly doing to others what was done to them. 
By equating the murderer and the victim, we wash our hands. 
"The ugly Israeli" and "the ugly American" seem to be of the same family. "The ugly Jew" becomes the instrumental part of this defamation when so-called neoconservatives are blamed both for American militarism and Israeli brutalities and then selectively named: Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, Kristol, etc. 
Earlier this year, the editor of Die Zeit , Josef Joffe, put his finger on the issue: like Jews, Americans are said to be selfish and arrogant. 
Like Jews, they are in thrall to a fundamentalist religion that renders them self-righteous and dangerous. 
Like Jews, Americans are money-grabbing capitalists, for whom the highest value is the cash nexus. "America and Israel are the outsiders - just as Jews have been all the way into the 21st century," Joffe says. 
The links between anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are all too real. 
Unless Europe's leaders roundly condemn this unholy triple alliance, it will poison Middle East politics and transatlantic relations alike. 
The Tabloid Syndrome 
The world is a complex and intricate place. 
So how are we to understand even just a piece of it, say, the United States government and its economic policies? 
It is a big problem, for the standard sources that I was taught as a child to rely upon – newspapers and television news – are breaking down. 
For example, in early February 2004, the then Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, N. Gregory Mankiw, spent some time trying to explain the issues surrounding “outsourcing” to America’s elite political news reporters. 
Mankiw’s standard description of outsourcing is very much like mine – indeed, like that of all neoclassical and neoliberal economists – and goes something like this: 
As with any change in technology that increases the volume of international trade in goods and services, the outsourcing of service-sector jobs creates winners and losers – but almost surely more and bigger winners than losers. 
Big winners are workers in poor countries who get better jobs working for firms that can now export services to rich countries. 
The major losers are those who previously held the now-outsourced service-sector jobs; they must now find new and different jobs and almost surely find that their skills are worth less. 
But even in the US, losers’ losses are outweighed by winners’ gains. 
Workers in certain industries find their skills in higher demand as foreigners spend their increased dollar earnings, consumers benefit from lower prices, and shareholders and managers see their companies’ profits increase. 
However much we may worry about the distributional consequences of outsourcing, we should never overlook the fact that it increases the total size of the economic pie. 
Mankiw made that argument, but he failed to be understood. 
Indeed, on February 10, 2004, he woke up to an unpleasant news story in the Washington Post: ”President Bush’s top economist yesterday said the outsourcing of US service jobs to workers overseas is good for the nation’s economy.... 
Mankiw’s comments come as the president struggles to shore up support in manufacturing states that have lost millions of jobs....Mankiw’s conclusions may prove discordant during an election year...” 
It happened again on February 11: “Democrats...lit into President Bush’s chief economist yesterday for his laudatory statements on the movement of U.S. jobs abroad.... 
Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.) called for the resignation of N. Gregory Mankiw...” 
Of course, the Washington Post’s journalists know, on some level, that they were being unfair to Mankiw. 
They didn’t claim that what he said was inaccurate, or shortsighted, or analytically unsound. 
The descriptive terms they used – “discordant,” “embarrassing,” “political liability” – suggest that they knew they were giving Mankiw a raw deal. 
But was there any sign of the standard economic analysis of outsourcing in their stories? 
Not one. 
Greg Mankiw thought a bunch of reporters were coming to talk to him about the state of the economy and the analysis made by the Council of Economic Advisers in its “2004 Economic Report of the President.” 
But the last thing the reporters wanted to do was to convey a thumbnail summary of Mankiw’s analysis of outsourcing. 
That’s simply not the business they saw themselves as being in. 
The problem is not that the Washington Post and papers like it hire people who are unintelligent or lazy. 
The problem is that conveying accurate information about the economy is far down the list of priorities for normal news reporters. 
Making a splash matters. 
So does keeping track of who is up politically and who is down. 
So does pleasing your editors so that they’ll give your stories better placement, and pleasing your sources so that they’ll keep talking to you. 
Compared to these imperatives, there is little to be gained from informing the public about how the economy really functions and about the dilemmas of economic policy. 
Indeed, the economy is vastly inferior to Hollywood as a source of glitterati gossip, but much economic reporting makes the coverage of the birth of Brad Pitt’s and Angelina Jolie’s baby look profoundly serious. 
Likewise, government is vastly inferior to the World Cup as a sporting spectacle, but much political reporting focuses on who played well and who played badly. 
What can we do about this? 
The answer is simple, and it is a matter of demand, not supply. 
After all, few people go into journalism to deliberately mislead the public. 
If we demand better economic and political journalism the way we demand excellent coverage of the World Cup, we’ll get it. 
The Tails Wagging the Kremlin Dog? 
MOSCOW – Imagine a crank who tries to pass himself off as a nineteenth-century Russian baron. 
He grows sideburns, wears a long frock-coat, and carries a walking stick. 
Anyone who runs into such a figure would sneer and mock him. 
Now, suppose that same crank attempted to treat passersby as if they were his serfs. 
In that case, he would risk getting a beating, though perhaps a few beggars would indulge his fantasies in the hope of duping him out of his money. 
Something of this sort now characterizes relations between Russia and several former Soviet republics, for the foreign-policy doctrine that guides today’s Kremlin is a preposterous mix of nineteenth-century Realpolitik and early twentieth-century geopolitics. 
According to this view, every great power needs obedient satellite countries. 
Under such an approach, NATO’s expansion is represented as an extension of America’s sphere of influence, to the detriment of Russia, of course. 
In order to compensate for its growing inferiority complex, Russia has cobbled together the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which, by its title and constitutional principles, is a parody of NATO. For all this, the Kremlin is not in the least embarrassed by the fact that the CSTO is essentially a mechanical connection of bilateral military agreements between Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia. 
Nobody knows what vision of collective defense is to be implemented: one needs a fertile imagination to imagine Belarusian paratroopers defending the Tajik border. 
Moreover, the constitutions of a number of CSTO countries expressly prohibit sending troops outside national territory. 
But the Kremlin’s myopic concentration on military matters, and its pointless attempts to play a zero-sum game with the West has turned Russia into an object for manipulation by its junior partners. 
The virtuoso of such manipulation is Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Belarus’s economy can function only if Russia subsidizes energy prices and allocates non-repayable credits. 
Yet, despite all this, Lukashenko manages to avoid implementing economic projects profitable to Russia (i.e., a single currency). 
Whenever Russia applies pressure, he immediately starts yelling about Moscow’s “ingratitude” – proclaiming that “10,000,000 Belarusians protect Russia from NATO’s tanks.” 
Worse, whenever Moscow persists in its demands, Lukashenko abrogates agreements without a twinge of conscience. 
Thus, when Russia banned imports of Belarusian dairy products (in an attempt to punish Lukashenko for accepting a $2,000,000,000 credit but not fulfilling his promise to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia), Lukashenko refused to attend a CSTO summit or join its collective agreement for the establishment of an operational response force. 
Lukashenko avoids any major integration projects, even those in the military sphere. 
The most telling example is the creation of a joint air defense system. 
Both Russia and Belarus have been trying to realize this project for ten years; countless agreements have been achieved – on paper. 
Yet no concrete action is taken. 
Lukashenko, simply, does not intend to allow even a small part of his army to become subordinated to Moscow. 
While the military threat in the West looks as illusory as it is, in Central Asia that threat is concrete. 
In the event that the coalition of NATO forces in Afghanistan is defeated, a wave of Islamic extremism will submerge the Central Asian states, inciting local civil wars. 
For Russia, this could mean (in the best case) tens of thousands of refugees or (in the worst case) the arrival of armed militias on its territory. 
As a result, the Kremlin has a vital interested in NATO’s success in Afghanistan. 
Yet, for the last four years, Russia has tried to hinder NATO in every possible way. 
In 2005, at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Vladimir Putin pressed for the final declaration to include a demand for withdrawal of American bases from Central Asia. 
Kremlin strategists explained that they feared the US would oust Russia from Central Asia. 
But, now that a Russian-American agreement allows supply flights to Afghanistan to go through Russian airspace, it is clear that Russia sought only to monopolize the military cargo transportation routs in order to gain leverage over the United States. 
In February, the Kremlin gave Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev $500 million for a promise to close America’s base in his country. 
Then the Americans offered Bakiyev $160 million a year, and now there may be no official base, but a “transit center” that serves the same functions. 
So the Kremlin paid out several hundred million dollars just to replace some signs. 
Soon after this, Russian Vice Premier Igor Sechin and Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov were sent to Bishkek in an effort to get something for Russia’s money. 
Bakiyev seems to have said: so, you are worried about the American military presence in Central Asia, and you want to confront it. 
Fine, the Americans can have one base in Kyrgyzstan, and Russia can have two. 
The resulting “military asset,” however, is strategic gibberish, having been built in Kyrgyzstan’s near-lawless Osh region, with its appalling poverty, drug trafficking, and ethnic tensions. 
Seizure of a Russian military base in order to acquire weapons is, indeed, likely to become a vital goal of “extremists.” 
But, in a way, the Russian soldiers there are already hostages – not least to the Kremlin’s bankrupt foreign policy. 
The Talmud and Greek Debt 
BUENOS AIRES – There are two ways to look at Greece’s majestically unsustainable sovereign-debt mountain. 
There is, first, a pragmatic and short-term perspective, which focuses on ensuring some form of orderly restructuring (possibly for other vulnerable European states as well) without bringing down the eurozone. 
And there is a “moral” perspective, which focuses on the nature of debt and on the long-term economic consequences of failing to honor it. 
Neither perspective is wrong; on the contrary, the problem is how to reconcile them. 
Indeed, failure to do so appears to explain why the official response to the Greek debt crisis has been so inadequate. 
In these circumstances, the Talmud, the ancient repository of Jewish legal commentary – and one of the oldest sources of human thought on morality and economic activity – might hold the key. 
An oft-quoted passage provides a fresh, if not exactly new, perspective on Greece’s debt and the best way to address it. 
The passage concerns sales, divorces, and offerings, and specifies that these acts are legally valid only if a person performs them voluntarily. 
Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, courts may force an individual until he says that he is, indeed, willing. 
The verse says, literally, “We (the court) force him until he says that he wants to do it willingly.” 
So, “in divorces (if the man refuses to grant it), we exercise force on him until he says ‘I want to do it voluntarily.’” 
Similarly, if a court forces a person to sell his property, the sale is valid because it is considered to have been carried out voluntarily. 
Understanding this apparent contradiction sheds light on the controversy surrounding the question of private bondholders’ involvement in the Greek rescue package. 
It is argued that, to avoid a default, private creditors should agree to shoulder part of the cost of the bailout. 
But how does one impose a financial loss on bondholders without it being classified by credit-rating agencies as a default? 
The prevailing answer is that one coerces bondholders to accept the deal “voluntarily.” 
One could dismiss this dispute as being mere rhetoric. 
But, using the Talmudic logic, one can also show that there are mechanisms that can – and should – be used to place pressure on the parties in the interest of obtaining superior voluntary outcomes. 
There are two preponderant interpretations of the Talmudic passage. 
One argues that coercion can change minds. 
When a court forces an individual until he surrenders and says that he wants to follow orders, his compliant actions are to be considered voluntary, because, ultimately, he has made the conscious decision to agree. 
While technically correct, this is a ruthless interpretation, since this type of “willing” behavior is bound to leave resentment. 
A more benign interpretation, based on the collective-action principle, envisages the court as instrumental in attaining a superior welfare equilibrium. 
Individuals know fundamentally what is good for them and for society, but they are often hesitant to act accordingly, owing to fear, embarrassment, or, very often, the belief that their actions will not be worthwhile if others do not follow in their footsteps. 
The court, according to this view, provides the coordinating mechanism, eliminating free riders and forcing all parties to an outcome that makes everybody better off. 
Thus, individual decisions, though extracted under pressure, become, when assessing the outcome, truly voluntary. 
Seen in this light, unilateral schemes, such as the original German proposal (forcing maturities on Greek debt to be voluntarily extended for several years) are only voluntary under the ruthless interpretation. 
In initiatives of this sort, agreement is obtained reluctantly and pressure could provoke harsh responses. 
Rating agencies are right in considering them a “selective” default that is bound to result in contagion – and, eventually, in widespread debt restructuring. 
The alternative is to seek a cooperative resolution, consistent with the benign interpretation of “forced willingness.” 
This can be achieved by adopting some features of the model used in Eastern Europe, known as the “Vienna Initiative.” 
Some of the current proposal to deal “voluntarily” with the Greek debt goes some way in this direction. 
But the initiative is insufficient, because the three pillars of the Vienna model are basically missing. 
The first pillar of that model is simultaneous involvement of all parties – the sovereign, bondholders and their governments, the European Central Bank, and international organizations – in designing the scheme from the start. 
The second ingredient is proper incentives to participate, including direct financing from bondholders’ governments, using the resources that today finance the transfer of Greek debt from private to official hands. 
The third component is the exercise of suasion on bondholders to achieve maximum participation, obtain binding pre-commitments, and eliminate free riders. 
Since this scheme would imply losses for bondholders, substantial official muscle and peer pressure is needed. 
But gaining time for a more orderly resolution, mitigating contagion, and reducing the size of an eventual write-down do indeed add up to a superior outcome. 
Therefore, under this model – and despite the initial pressure – the behavior of bondholders could be considered truly voluntary. 
And, while rating agencies might still regard a Vienna-type outcome as a default, the Talmudic sages show us why a more thoughtful classification is required. 
The Tea Party’s Modest Proposal 
WASHINGTON, DC – America’s Tea Party has a simple fiscal message: the United States is broke. 
This is factually incorrect – US government securities remain one of the safest investments in the world – but the claim serves the purpose of dramatizing the federal budget and creating a great deal of hysteria around America’s current debt levels. 
This then produces the fervent belief that government spending must be cut radically, and now. 
There are legitimate fiscal issues that demand serious discussion, including how to control growth in health-care spending and how best to structure tax reform. 
But the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party cares more about small government than anything else: its members insist, above all, that federal tax revenue never be permitted to exceed 18% of GDP. 
Their historical antecedent is America’s anti-revenue Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, not the original anti-British, pro-representation Boston Tea Party in 1773. 
Most importantly, their tactics have proven massively destructive of wealth in the US. 
Since the prolonged showdown over the budget began earlier this year, the stock market has lost about 20% of its value (roughly $10 trillion). 
In effect, the Tea Party is working hard to reduce publicly funded social benefits – including pensions and Medicare – even as its methods dramatically reduce the value of private wealth now and in the future. 
Part of the Tea Party’s founding myth, of course, is that smaller government will lead to faster growth and greater prosperity for all. 
Never mind that the eye-popping growth projections in Representative Paul Ryan’s budget plan, for example, are utterly implausible; these projections matter politically, because, without them, the full sting of Ryan’s proposed Medicare cuts would be readily apparent. 
Standard & Poor’s has received some justified criticism for the analysis behind its recent decision to downgrade US government debt; after all, there was little economic news that could explain the move’s timing. 
But S&P’s assessment of the political situation is on target: by creating a dysfunctional paralysis at the heart of government, the Tea Party has shown that it is willing to impose dramatic costs on the broader economy and to ensure significantly slower growth. 
Confrontation and brinkmanship have become the new watchwords of American politics, even when the US government’s legal ability to pay its debts is on the line, owing to the Tea Party’s ideological rigidity. 
And the tone of political debate, not surprisingly, has become much nastier. 
By signing a pledge not to raise taxes, Tea Party representatives have credibly committed themselves not to acquiesce in any middle-of-the-road compromise. 
If they break this pledge, presumably they will face defeat in the next round of Republican Party primaries. 
So, while a budget deal would technically be easy to achieve, it looks politically impossible in the near term. 
Indeed, while Congress and the Republican Party have become less popular during 2011, support for the Tea Party has remained remarkably constant, at around 30% of the population. 
Its tactics thus appear politically sustainable, at least through the 2012 elections. 
Perhaps the most damaging outcome of these tactics is to take countercyclical fiscal policy off the table completely. 
Regardless of what happens to the global economy in the weeks and months ahead, it is inconceivable that any kind of meaningful fiscal stimulus would get through the House of Representatives. 
It remains to be seen whether the US Federal Reserve will also feel constrained by the political mood on Capitol Hill. 
Clearly, influential Tea Party supporters would strongly resist any attempt now by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to find unorthodox ways to run a more expansionary monetary policy. 
And, as for protecting the financial system against disaster, the current majority on the House Financial Services Committee is clear – they favor use of the bankruptcy system when megabanks get into serious trouble. 
If the eurozone crisis continues to spiral out of control, the US should expect to see Lehman or near-Lehman-type collapses among exposed financial institutions. 
The irony of the Tea Party revolt, of course, is that it undermines the private sector more than it reins in “big government.” 
The S&P downgrade resulted in a “flight to quality,” meaning that investors bought US government debt – thus increasing its price and lowering the rate that the federal government pays to borrow. 
It was the value of the stock market that fell sharply – which makes sense, given that counter-cyclical policy is now severely constrained. 
The government part of the credit system has been strengthened, relatively speaking, by developments over the past few months. 
It is the private sector – where investment and entrepreneurial activity are needed to generate growth and employment – that has taken a beating. 
Unless and until America’s private sector recovers, investment and job creation will continue to stagnate. 
But today’s atmosphere of fear and aggressive budget tactics are combining to undermine private-sector confidence and spending power. 
As Jonathan Swift put it in 1727, “Party is the madness of many, for the gain of the few.” 
The Terror Next Door. 
NEW DELHI – The fallout from the terror attacks in Mumbai last week has already shaken India. 
Deep and sustained anger across the country – at its demonstrated vulnerability to terror and at the multiple institutional failures that allowed such loss of life – has prompted the resignations of the Home Minister in the national government and the Chief Minister and his Deputy in the state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital. 
As evidence mounts that the attacks were planned and directed from Pakistani territory, calls for decisive action have intensified. 
But what can India do? 
The terrorists hit multiple targets in Mumbai, both literally and figuratively. 
They caused death and destruction to Indians with near-impunity, searing India’s psyche, showing up the limitations of its security apparatus and humiliating its government. 
They dented the worldwide image of India as an emerging economic giant, a success story of the era of globalization and an increasing magnet for investors and tourists. Instead the world was made to see an insecure and vulnerable India, a “soft state” bedevilled by enemies who can strike it at will. 
That was not all. 
By singling out Americans, British and Israelis for their malign attention, the terrorists extended the global Islamist war against “Jews and crusaders” to new territory. 
As they dominated the world’s media for three gruesome days, the killers achieved a startling success for their cause, one that must have shaken anti-terrorist experts around the world, who now realize how easy it would be for ten men unafraid of death to hold any city in the world hostage. 
The interrogation of the one surviving terrorist, and evidence from satellite telephone intercepts and other intelligence, has led to an emerging international consensus that the attacks were masterminded by the Wahhabi-inspired Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist group once patronized, protected and trained by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as a useful instrument in their country’s proxy war against India in Kashmir. 
Though banned by General Pervez Musharraf under duress after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Lashkar (which considers the United States, Israel and India “existential enemies of Islam”) simply regrouped under a different name and is even more powerful than before. 
The Pakistani military finds militant outfits useful tools to bleed their adversaries in India and Afghanistan, and has shown little inclination to clamp down on them, despite years of assurances that action would be taken to curb their activities. 
In July this year, American intelligence sources publicly revealed that the suicide-bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul had been conducted at the behest of the ISI. 
This episode, along with two climbdowns by Pakistan’s government after public attempts to curb the ISI had been spurned by the Army, confirmed that the civilian government in Islamabad is too weak to challenge the all-powerful military. 
So if the US and India demand, as they will, that Pakistan disband the Lashkar and similar terrorist outfits that have enjoyed military patronage in the past, dismantle their training facilities, freeze their bank accounts (before they are simply transferred to another name) and arrest their leaders, they will face a typically Pakistani conundrum: the military isn’t willing, and the civilian government isn’t able. 
India’s government, which has reacted to previous terrorist outrages with calm and restraint, has no choice this time but to respond decisively. 
Anything that smacks of temporizing and appeasement will further inflame the public a few months before national elections are due. 
But India’s government has few good options. 
An earlier assault on India’s Parliament in December 2001 by the Pakistan-based militant organization Jaish-e-Muhammad, nearly triggered a full-scale war between the two countries. 
In the end India pulled back its deployment on the border. 
Though some hotheads in India now call for military action, including strikes on terrorist facilities in Pakistani territory, this would certainly lead to a war that neither side could win. 
If anything, such an Indian reaction would play into the hands of the terrorists, by strengthening anti-Indian nationalism in Pakistan and diverting forces away from the Afghan borderlands, where they are aiding NATO’s fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. 
For this reason, the US is likely to press India not to contemplate forceful retaliation that could undermine America’s objectives in Afghanistan. 
And since both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, the risk of military action spiralling out of control is too grave for any responsible government to contemplate. 
Yet inaction is not an option. 
So India is likely to ask the US to use its undoubted clout with Pakistan – the US is a huge donor of both military and economic assistance to its near-bankrupt ally – to demand tougher action against the militants on its territory. 
The governments of the victims of the Mumbai massacre are also likely to demand accountability from Islamabad. 
Pakistan is likely to face disagreeable diplomatic and economic consequences for inaction. 
But excessive pressure may only bring down the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, who is personally inclined towards rapprochement with India but who knows that every one of his civilian predecessors has been overthrown. 
Contemplating such options, the world may be forced to admit its impotence. 
The Third Way: an Epitaph 
The last half-century has seen the end of ideological politics in much of the world. 
First came the apocalyptic collapse of fascism as Hitler took Germany with him into a collective suicide. 
Fascism's demise was followed by the more gradual disintegration of communism after Stalin's death and Khrushchev's revelations of Stalin's crimes. 
The failed revolutions in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 foreshadowed the eventual failure of the Soviet empire in 1989. 
While these pseudo-religions collapsed, a benevolent ideology of social democracy dominated much of Europe. 
Its core was the belief that the state could provide both stable economic growth and social welfare to cushion the negative side effects of free markets. 
Not everyone subscribed to this theory, but it was the West's strongest political force for several decades. 
Christian Democrats, and even conservative parties, adopted its tenets. 
But by the early 1980's social democracy had exhausted itself. 
It had simply been too successful to remain a force for change. 
Moreover, it had brought about new rigidities, notably bureaucratization and that deadly phenomenon of the 1970's, stagflation - economic stagnation and high unemployment coupled with galloping inflation. 
The reaction to this malaise came swiftly, and it had a name - well, two names: Ronald Reagan and, above all, Margaret Thatcher. 
"Thatcherism" was not really much of an ideology; it was more a gut reaction to the stagnant 1970's, an attempt to loosen the bureaucratic straitjacket of the state and to reveal that not everything that arose from state benevolence was good. 
Even the word "neo-liberal" exaggerates the intellectual coherence of this counter force. 
This change in political direction coincided with ­- indeed, was perhaps responsible for - the process that we now call globalization. 
Thatcherism plus globalization had many liberating consequences, but the combination also created new social problems, begetting losers as well as winners. 
The Thatcherite counter-revolution was so successful that it, too, began to incite countervailing pressures. 
By the late 1990's, the political scene almost everywhere came to be dominated by the desire to combine competitiveness and growth-induced wealth creation on the one hand with solidarity, justice, and social cohesion on the other. 
Both were to be achieved within a liberal order. 
This is the main political project in most free societies, and it is in principle acceptable to all major parties. 
Yet some tried to turn it into a new ideological edifice. 
They believed that a new age of social democracy had dawned, and for a while they sought to prove their point: Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Gerhard Schroeder, Romano Prodi, even some of those elected in the postcommunist countries seemed to belong to this political camp. 
The new "Third Way" spreading from Washington to London to the rest of the world seemed to embody these leaders' own ideology. 
As it turned out, this episode was even shorter-lived than the conservative counter-revolution. 
Indeed, it was no more than an episode. 
Some of us always suspected that the Schroeder-Blair idea of "New Labour" or, in German, the "New Center," had no real basis. 
Soon it emerged that not all its apparent supporters actually supported it; when Chancellor Schroeder's proposed reforms caused squeals within his own party, he quickly dropped much of the Third Way program like a hot potato. 
At the same time, Blair found more sympathy for the Third Way with his Spanish conservative colleague José María Aznar than among many social democrats. 
The apparent hegemony of neo-social democrats began to crumble after only a few years. 
Aznar was not the only conservative to replace a socialist government in the Mediterranean world, and the recent defeat of the socialists in Greece is unlikely to be the last. 
The Benelux countries, some Scandinavian states, and many of the new Europeans of East Central Europe have chosen traditionally right-of-centre parties. 
The German Chancellor and his "red-green" coalition still clings to power but is today severely weakened. 
Even Tony Blair is struggling to hold on. 
All this does not augur a new change of direction in Europe. 
If Schroeder gave way to the Christian Democrats, indeed even if President Bush lost to his Democrat challenger, this would not imply the dawn of a new age. 
Domestically the one and only issue in most countries remains the same: how to provide a sustainable basis for economic growth in the harsh climate of the global marketplace while at the same time maintaining solidarity and a sense of fairness throughout society. 
Whoever governs must try to square this circle. 
This would truly be the end of ideology at last, were it not for the new challenges arising from the temptations of various kinds of fundamentalism. 
Versions of nationalism as well as the ascendancy of religiously tinted forms of integrisme threaten the fabric of a free world. 
The inventors of the Third Way mostly overlooked the value of individual liberty, but it is this that remains the single most important issue in a world where open societies still face mortal enemies. 
The Third Way is A Rightwing Way 
CHICAGO: "Only de Gaulle could free Algeria; only Nixon could open up China." 
This insight is particularly useful in Europe, and increasingly around the globe, when examining the actions of supposedly leftwing and socialist governments. 
In the late 1950s France came near to civil war over Algeria. 
Out of power since 1946, Charles de Gaulle was summoned back to the Elysée to lead France out of this quagmire. 
Because of his patriotism, de Gaulle seemed the only man able to set Algeria free. 
Starting in the late 1960’s rapprochement between Mao’s China and America became possible because China was involved in political and military conflicts with the Soviet Union. 
America’s Democrats knew this as well as the Republicans, but President Johnson was afraid to approach China because his party was supposedly soft on communism. 
Only a dedicated anti-Communist like Nixon had sufficient political support from the right to visit China and urge cooperation between the US and China against their common enemy in the Kremlin. 
Economics is not immune from this dynamic. 
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher successfully promoted lower income taxes, privatization of government enterprises, weaker unions, and a generally smaller role for government. 
The popularity and success of their programs induced liberal, labor, and social democratic governments in many nations to also promote free market policies in direct conflict with their traditional ideologies. 
Often, only these parties have sufficient political support on the left to succeed in introducing needed reforms in labor and other markets. 
Market reforms initiated by the left started in 1984 with a New Zealand labor government which enacted legislation that transformed a small formerly isolated nation into one of the most "liberal" economies in the world. 
New Zealand’s Laborites privatized the postal system and many other public enterprises, and changed the country’s employment system from highly centralized collective bargaining to one that gave employers considerable discretion to hire and fire and to pay market-determined wages. 
The Democratic Party of the US has in the past strongly supported big government, but under President Bill Clinton it took heed of the popularity of the Republican Party’s stance advocating less paternalism and smaller government. 
It was President Clinton, not Bush or Reagan, who declared that "the era of big government was over" as his administration radically reversed traditional Democratic positions on welfare, balanced budgets, public debt reduction, and the encouragement of business. 
A telling example of this trend is found in Mexico’s economic policies of the 1980’s and 1990’s. 
The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that governed Mexico uninterrupted for seven decades (until its recent loss of the presidency to Vincente Fox) had been a strong advocate of government ownership of heavy industry, prohibitive duties on imports to protect domestic companies, and detailed regulation of labor and financial markets. 
Starting with President Miguel de la Madrid in the early 1980’s, however, the PRI responded to free market critics of Mexico’s weak economic performance by selling many government-owned enterprises, partially privatizing the Mexican social security system, and becoming a strong advocate of a free trade agreement with its large “enemy” to the north, the US. 
So President Fox needs only to continue this revolution, not start his own. 
Argentina’s Senate recently reacted to very high unemployment by passing a labor market reform bill that cuts union power and gives employers flexibility in hiring and firing. 
This reform is being promoted by the new center-left government of Fernando de la Rua after the failure of attempts to reform the labor market by the previous conservative government of Carlos Menem. 
But it is recent policy changes in Germany and France that provide, perhaps, the most impressive examples of the "de Gaulle/Algeria" and "Nixon/China" theory of political reform. 
Both nations suffered high unemployment and slow growth during the 1990’s, in good measure due to heavy-handed regulation of labor and other markets. 
Conservative governments in these nations accomplished little in the way of serious market reform, despite considerable rhetoric. 
The Jospin and Schroeder governments were elected on manifestos that promised to cut unemployment and raise growth by expanding government regulation. 
Each regime did in fact start out by introducing more government controls - including a law to implement a 35 hour week in France. 
Both governments, however, soon -- and quite stealthily -- reversed course. 
Gerhard Schroeder in Germany has now slashed corporate taxes, is encouraging startup companies, and promises to provide tax breaks for private pension plans. 
French Premier Jospin quietly liberalized the French labor market by allowing for more part-time work, increased privatization, and promoted a more globally competitive financial system with reduced governmental control. 
If Nixon could seek agreement with Communist China, and de Gaulle surrender Algeria, it is a relatively small step for Socialists to embrace the free market and support much lower taxes on business. 
In politics as in life, ideology is usually overwhelmed by self-interest. 
The Three Faces of Putin 
MOSCOW: Being president of Russia is often caricatured as being like a tsar, but the powers of President Vladimir Putin are more constrained than the Kremlin’s former autocrats and Politburo chieftains. 
An obvious sign of this is the amount of time Putin spends on foreign trips with little diplomatic justification. 
Diplomacy, however, allows a president opportunity to enhance his authority for future domestic battles. 
The constraints Putin faces are not constitutional but are formed by the three factions that make up his government. 
One is a group of FSB (the successor agency to the KGB) men from St. Petersburg, headed by Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov. 
The second consists of liberal economists and lawyers from Putin’s home town of St. Petersburg, with Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin and Minister of Economy German Gref the leading lights. 
The third faction is an “oligarchic” business-oriented group led by Putin’s chief of staff Alexander Voloshin, Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and the secretive oil and aluminum tycoon Roman Abramovich, perhaps Russia’s richest man at age 33. 
Because of these three very visible fault lines, some Russians describe their country as having distinct security, economic, and political/business governments. 
The FSB people naturally focus on security, law, and order. 
The St. Petersburg liberals pursue market economic reforms. 
But, as under Yeltsin, it is the oligarchic faction that dominates, for it controls the Presidential Administration, the Council of Ministers, two centrist parliamentary factions, and much of Russia’s oil, aluminum, railways and nuclear industries. 
So far, Putin has compromised with the oligarchic force, which has reduced his personal imprint on policies. It is too powerful and skillful to be challenged head-on. 
Kremlin policymaking is largely an interplay between these three factions. 
The institutional checks and balances built into Russia’s constitution have been neutralized. 
Rampant corruption has discredited regional governors as a counterweight. 
Indeed, the financial crash of August 1998 was provoked in large measure by governors issuing big subsidies to friendly local enterprises and demanding kick-backs in return. 
By slashing subsidies from regional budgets, federal revenues increased from 9% of GDP in 1998 to 17% of GDP this year. 
Not a surprise, then, that the governors cannot mobilize popular support as federal authorities impose accountability standards on them. 
The State Duma has also faded. 
Under Yeltsin, deputies’ votes were routinely purchased; now the Kremlin’s FSB faction pressures deputies by reminding them of their past bribe-taking. 
Parliamentarians complain about “KGB threats,” but honesty doesn’t seem a lot to ask of Duma members. 
The real problem in policymaking is forging agreement between Putin’s three factions. 
Take the example of the Kursk disaster. 
The politics of the sunken submarine were handled by Sergei Ivanov. 
The other factions thought that he deserved the hostile criticism that followed in the wake of the Kremlin’s bumbles, and the liberals hoped that this debacle would reinforce independent media. 
As no faction embraces the military, an expected rise in defense expenditures has been insignificant; indeed, Putin is slashing 600,000 men from Russia’s military. 
All three factions applaud the downfalls of media oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, but for different reasons. 
The FSB favors keeping the media under the Kremlin’s thumb. 
Abramovich, brought to the fore by Berezovsky, is eliminating his competitors. 
Liberals see Berezovsky and Gusinsky as the main practitioners of corruption and responsible for the demise of market reform in 1997. 
Thus, the outstanding issue is media freedom, with the FSB faction and the liberals opposing one another. 
Neither the FSB people nor the oligarchs focus on economic policy beyond their immediate interests, abandoning that field to the liberals, who radically reformed taxes, cleaned up the state budget, and monetized the economy by curbing barter. 
Pension reform with private savings accounts and land reform leading to private ownership of land seem within reach. 
Prospects for economic reform have never been brighter than in 2000. 
The main problem is producing well-designed reforms backed by key officials. 
Here a big problem arises from the fact that industrial ministers continue to interfere because they represent business interests or are even in business themselves. 
Last September, Minister of Communications Leonid Reiman, a key member of the St. Petersburg FSB group, deprived two leading Russian mobile phone companies of their frequencies so as to benefit a company favored by him. 
Fortunately, his decision was reversed by the government after public uproar. 
In the coming year, Putin’s big test will be over control of gas monopoly Gazprom, now co-owned by its managers and the state. 
Its long-time CEO Rem Vyakhirev departs next May. 
Incredibly, Russia’s largest company - with one third of the world’s gas reserves - is unprofitable because of poor management and theft. 
Billions of dollars are siphoned off each year through companies allegedly controlled by Gazprom managers. 
Clearly, Putin wants to end this robbery of state assets, and minority shareholders are up in arms, but the insatiable Abramovich wants Gazprom, and Voloshin yearns to become its next CEO. 
Will Putin stand against them? 
A smaller drama concerns Russia’s railways. 
Railway Minister Nikolai Aksenenko, who belongs to the oligarchic family, wants to turn the rail system into a monopoly akin to Gazprom, while the St. Petersburg liberals want to divide the rail network into competing private companies. 
The outcome remains unclear. 
Beside Gazprom, the banking system is Russia’s economic black hole. 
No sensible person keeps money in a Russian bank. 
Here, the stumbling block is the old-style apparatchik Viktor Gerashchenko, Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, who thrives on the mess. 
Because he is not involved in the power struggle, and since banking reform is a huge task, nobody seems prepared to take him on. 
Daily, each of Putin’s three faces can be seen. 
The future of his presidency will depend on which two ever will join into a unified faction. 
The Three Mis-Represents 
It is two years since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unveiled its new ideological credo, called the "Three Represents." 
What good fortune it is that China's most sacred, encompassing, and powerful doctrine built around the triumvirate of "the interests of the majority of the people" "advanced culture," and "advanced productive forces" found one political party to be its representative! 
Good fortune, that is, for the CCP, not for China and its people. 
The "Three Represents" has several official versions, each including the words "always," "China," and "represent." 
Their meaning is clear. 
On the other hand, "majority of the people," "advanced culture," and "advanced productive forces," as well as some other phrases that dominate the doctrine, are vague, perhaps deliberately so. 
Common sense suggests that the "majority of the people," whom the CCP is supposed to "represent," should include workers. 
But the CCP long ago abandoned the workers. 
How many lost their jobs last month? 
How many were forced to take early retirement? 
How many mining accidents were there? 
How many workers' protests? 
Who jailed their organizers? 
The "Representative of the Three Represents" refuse to say. 
Workers who protest and strike are "rioting." Whoever reports such events is "anti-revolutionary." 
The same is true of the Party's relationship with the peasants, who provided Mao Zedong with the soldiers and supplies he needed in battles that lasted decades. 
Peasants followed Mao because the CCP promised them land. 
But Mao decided to take back the land from the peasants even before it was given to them. 
"The serious problem is the education of the peasants," he said. 
So he taught them that all land belongs to the state. 
The "representatives" of the peasants are the new landlords. 
In a China without democracy, student sentiment is a key political barometer. 
Unlike workers or peasants, students include people from all levels of society, so whatever mobilizes them represents society's focus at that time. 
From April 15th to June 4th, 1989, students demonstrating in Tiananmen Square, and their supporters, conducted the saddest opinion poll in Chinese history, expressing a common will to end totalitarianism, build democracy, and eliminate corruption. 
Those who defend the Party's bloody crackdown of those students have no right to call themselves the representatives of the majority of the people. 
Their claim to be "always representing the progressive direction of advanced culture" is yet another grand and empty declaration. 
Chinese culture stretches three thousand years into the past and perhaps thousands of years into the future. 
Is it to be "always represented" by a lone political party? 
I do not know what "the progressive direction of advanced culture" is, but advanced culture played no part in the CCP-inspired "Wipe Out Poisonous Weeds Campaign," the "Anti-Rightist Movement," or the "Eliminate Demons and Evil Heresy Campaign." 
Such obscurantism only creates a culture of stultifying uniformity. 
Like a blade of grass beneath a stone, culture knows how and in which direction to seek light. 
It does not need to be "represented." 
Of the three "represents," the clearest meaning is to be found in the CCP's vow to "always represent the demands of advanced productive forces." 
This means representing the interests of the da-kuan, those who suddenly became rich, usually through government connections. 
The phrase has no deeper meaning. 
The union of power and money in today's China originates from the steady inflation of bureaucracy. 
Before the Great Leap Forward, townships could barely afford a few full-time cadres. 
Today, each township has hundreds. 
Their basic salary is paid by the central government, but bonuses and extra benefits depend on contributions from the "advanced productive forces" at the county and township level. 
Whatever the rich ask of the CCP - land leases, low interest loans, violation of labor laws, environmental standards, contracts, and intellectual property - can be considered "the demands of advanced productive forces." 
Even under less corrupt conditions, representing "the most advanced productive forces" is a flawed idea. 
Imagine that the Olympic Committee represented only the interests of gold medal winners, or that the Education Ministry represented only post-doctoral programs but ignored elementary schools. 
While the high-tech sector at the top of the economic pyramid is important, the traditional sectors at the bottom still form the foundation. 
What will become of several hundred million rural peasants and jobless workers in sunset industries? 
Who will address inequality and divergent social interests? 
An increasingly pluralistic society is being forced into a procrustean structure that allows only one voice, one need, and one kind of interest: the voice, needs, and interests of the party. 
But the theory of the Three Represents is nevertheless necessary, because a new situation has emerged. 
When the CCP came to power in 1948, it could claim to embody socialism, Marxism, and the proletariat's historical mission. 
Fifty years later, socialism's advantages, Marxism's truth, and the proletarian character of the Party have all been unanswerably challenged. 
So the Three Represents is an effort to salvage one-party rule. 
You may doubt socialism, but you cannot doubt "advanced productive forces." 
You may not believe in Marxism, but you must believe in "advanced culture." 
The CCP no longer represents workers and peasants, but it can represent the "majority of the people," including "red" capitalists. 
Indeed, whether CCP members who have become "revolutionarily" wealthy remain "red" is determined solely by their acceptance of one-party rule. 
Welcoming "red capitalists" therefore does not imply democratization. 
Such people are more likely to seek to strengthen their privileges than promote pluralism and the rule of law. 
Totalitarianism, not political reform, is their livelihood. 
It is this, above all else, that the theory of the Three Represents comprehends. 
The Three Swedish Models 
Sweden’s economic and social system, sometimes called the “Swedish Model,” is often depicted either as an ideal or an abnormality. 
But Sweden’s system has varied considerably. 
In fact, broadly speaking there have been three different Swedish “models” since the late nineteenth century. 
The first model lasted from about 1870 until the 1960’s. 
During this “liberal” period, the government basically provided stable market-supporting legislation, education, health care, and infrastructure. 
As late as 1960, both total government spending (as a share of GDP) and the distribution of earnings were similar to those prevailing in the United States. 
During this century-long period, Sweden moved from being one of the poorest western countries to being the third richest country in terms of GDP per capita. 
In other words, Sweden became a rich country before its highly generous welfare-state arrangements were created. 
A second era lasted from 1960 until 1985. 
The free-trade regime of the liberal period was retained during this period – indeed it was deepened by the various rounds of global trade liberalization – but the dominant thrust was the creation of a generous welfare state. 
By the late 1980’s, total public spending reached 60-65% of GDP, compared to about 30% in 1960. 
Moreover, marginal tax rates hit 65-75% for most full-time employees, compared to about 40% in 1960 (all taxes on households being included). 
Economic incentives to work, save, and start businesses were also reduced through the compression of wage differentials and a big squeeze on company profits, both largely the result of strong and centralized labor unions. 
Moreover, new labor-market regulations were introduced, the most important being strict job-security legislation implemented in the early 1970’s. 
The regulation of financial markets that was imposed during WWII was retained. 
It is this economic and social system that is usually identified as the “Swedish model.” 
Although economic performance during this period was not dismal, it was certainly not impressive. 
Between 1970 and 1995, GDP per capita in Sweden lagged by about 18% behind the average of rich OECD countries. 
As a result, Sweden fell from third to approximately seventeenth place in the OECD in terms of GDP per capita. 
This can partly be explained by the “catch up” mechanism, as technologically less advanced countries imported technology from more advanced countries. 
But this does not explain why 14 countries not only caught up with Sweden during this period, but surpassed it in terms of GDP per capita. 
The removal of capital-market regulations and foreign-exchange controls in the late 1980’s, and Sweden’s entry into the EU in the early 1990’s, signaled a new era – the embryo of a third Swedish model. 
In 1991, marginal tax rates were cut by 10-20% for large parts of the population. 
These reforms had broad political support and were, in fact, initiated during a social-democratic government. 
Subsequently, mainly during a period of center-right governance, several product markets were deregulated: telecommunications, electricity, road transport, taxis, and, to some extent, railways. 
A process of deregulation and privatization, although with continued tax-financing (in fact, basically a voucher system), began in the field of “human services,” in particular for childcare, education, and old-age care. 
One purpose of this was to increase competition and freedom of choice. 
Partly in response to these reforms, Sweden’s growth rate picked up from the mid 1990’s, and today about a third of the previous lag in GDP per capita since 1970 (as compared to other developed countries) has been recovered. 
However, Sweden is still characterized by high welfare dependency, with about 23% of working-age people in recent years living on various types of government benefits, including temporary and permanent disability payments. 
The new center-right government elected in the fall of 2006 has committed itself to continuing economic liberalization. 
The government has announced plans to privatize state-owned companies, improve conditions for small firms, and continue increasing individual freedom of choice in the case of human services. 
It has also abolished the wealth tax (after the previous social-democratic government had already abolished the inheritance tax). 
Moreover, the government has modestly reduced taxes on wages and slightly scaled down the generosity of some benefits. 
One argument for the latter policy is to improve the government’s budget, another to make work more economically rewarding relative to government benefits. 
Indeed, in important respects today’s Sweden is moving back to the liberal economic regime that existed before the explosion of government interventionism in the 1960’s. 
But there are two basic caveats. 
First, all political parties agree that welfare-state arrangements should remain tax-financed, although possibly with a stronger application of insurance principles in the social insurance systems. 
So even if the generosity of state benefits may be curtailed, aggregate government spending is unlikely to be rolled back dramatically from the current 53% of GDP. 
Second, there is general agreement that the government should take more active responsibility for environmental issues, although policies in this area increasingly rely on market instruments (prices for environmental disturbances) rather than on quantitative regulations 
Clearly, some of these policy measures may conflict with traditional egalitarianism in Sweden, at least in the short term. 
Hence, the big question underlying the current wave of liberalization is whether these reform tendencies are politically sustainable. 
The next general election in 2010 will give part of the answer. 
The Three Trillion Dollar War 
NEW YORK – With March 20 marking the fifth anniversary of the United States-led invasion of Iraq, it’s time to take stock of what has happened. 
In our new book The Three Trillion Dollar War , Harvard’s Linda Bilmes and I conservatively estimate the economic cost of the war to the US to be $3 trillion, and the costs to the rest of the world to be another $3 trillion – far higher than the Bush administration’s estimates before the war. 
The Bush team not only misled the world about the war’s possible costs, but has also sought to obscure the costs as the war has gone on. 
This is not surprising. 
After all, the Bush administration lied about everything else, from Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction to his supposed link with al-Qaeda. 
Indeed, only after the US-led invasion did Iraq become a breeding ground for terrorists. 
The Bush administration said the war would cost $50 billion. 
The US now spends that amount in Iraq every three months. 
To put that number in context: for one-sixth of the cost of the war, the US could put its social security system on a sound footing for more than a half-century, without cutting benefits or raising contributions. 
Moreover, the Bush administration cut taxes for the rich as it went to war, despite running a budget deficit. 
As a result, it has had to use deficit spending – much of it financed from abroad –to pay for the war. 
This is the first war in American history that has not demanded some sacrifice from citizens through higher taxes; instead, the entire cost is being passed onto future generations. 
Unless things change, the US national debt – which was $5.7 trillion when Bush became president – will be $2 trillion higher because of the war (in addition to the $800 billion increase under Bush before the war) . 
Was this incompetence or dishonesty? 
Almost surely both. 
Cash accounting meant that the Bush administration focused on today’s costs, not future costs, including disability and health care for returning veterans. 
Only years after the war began did the administration order the specially armored vehicles that would have saved the lives of many killed by roadside bombs. 
Not wanting to reintroduce a draft, and finding it difficult to recruit for an unpopular war, troops have been forced into two, three, or four stress-filled deployments. 
The administration has tried to keep the war’s costs from the American public. 
Veterans groups have used the Freedom of Information Act to discover the total number of injured – 15 times the number of fatalities. 
Already, 52,000 returning veterans have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. 
America will need to provide disability compensation to an estimated 40% of the 1.65 million troops that have already been deployed. 
And, of course, the bleeding will continue as long as the war continues, with the health care and disability bill amounting to more than $600 billion (in present-value terms). 
Ideology and profiteering have also played a role in driving up the war’s costs. 
America has relied on private contractors, which have not come cheap. 
A Blackwater Security guard can cost more than $1,000 per day, not including disability and life insurance, which is paid for by the government. 
When unemployment rates in Iraq soared to 60%, hiring Iraqis would have made sense; but the contractors preferred to import cheap labor from Nepal, Philippines, and other countries. 
The war has had only two winners: oil companies and defense contractors. 
The stock price of Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney’s old company, has soared. 
But even as the government turned increasingly to contractors, it reduced its oversight. 
The largest cost of this mismanaged war has been borne by Iraq. 
Half of Iraq’s doctors have been killed or have left the country, unemployment stands at 25%, and, five years after the war’s start, Baghdad still has less than eight hours of electricity a day. 
Out of Iraq’s total population of around 28 million, four million are displaced and two million have fled the country. 
The thousands of violent deaths have inured most Westerners to what is going on: a bomb blast that kills 25 hardly seems newsworthy anymore. 
But statistical studies of death rates before and after the invasion tell some of the grim reality. They suggest additional deaths from a low of around 450,000 in the first 40 months of the war (150,000 of them violent deaths) to 600,000. 
With so many people in Iraq suffering so much in so many ways, it may seem callous to discuss the economic costs. 
And it may seem particularly self-absorbed to focus on the economic costs to America, which embarked on this war in violation of international law. 
But the economic costs are enormous, and they go well beyond budgetary outlays. 
Next month, I will explain how the war has contributed to America’s current economic woes. 
Americans like to say that there is no such thing as a free lunch. 
Nor is there such a thing as a free war. 
The US – and the world – will be paying the price for decades to come. 
The Time is Now to Fight Disease 
It is possible for a child born just ten years from now to live in a world where AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are on the wane. 
But this can only happen with considerable investment. 
Now. Otherwise, today’s grim picture will only get worse. 
Each day, these diseases kill 16,000 people—devastating entire communities and plummeting countries deeper into poverty. 
Upping the ante could turn the tables. 
Recent successes in Brazil against AIDS, in Mozambique against malaria, and in China against TB, show what can be achieved on a global scale with more resources. 
There are new ways of directing aid to where it is most needed. 
A key instrument is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. 
Created in 2002 as a partnership between governments and civil society, the Global Fund is unique in the way it aims to deliver assistance. 
Driven by real needs on the ground, projects are designed and implemented by recipients, and its procedures and operations are transparent. 
Of late there has been much talk about intensifying efforts to eradicate poverty. 
Ahead of the G8 summit in Scotland in July, a coalition of non-governmental organizations has launched the “Global Call to Action Against Poverty,” and the UK host has made Africa a top priority. 
Building on this momentum, the campaigns for debt relief, trade reform, and increasing aid to poor countries have gained traction. 
Yet, while pledges to increase development assistance have soared, short-term funding is woefully inadequate. 
Any strategy for raising living standards must include urgent measures that address AIDS, TB and malaria. 
Stemming the spread of this deadly trio of diseases is the linchpin in the global fight against poverty. 
Unchecked, these diseases not only sap the strength of national economies, but jeopardize peace and security. 
Teachers and nurses are dying; police and security forces are being hard hit, and 14 million children have already been orphaned by AIDS. 
We now risk failing to meet the Millennium Development GOAL, set out by the United Nations, of reversing the spread of AIDS, TB and malaria by 2015. 
This failure will make remote any hope of reaching the other Millennium goals in the fight against poverty. 
A comprehensive response to AIDS, TB and malaria is needed. 
Acting now means less spending in the long run. 
Investments in effective prevention, treatment and research in 2005 and 2006 will save millions of lives, lessen the socio-economic impact of the diseases in poorer countries, and remove the need for increased spending on these chronic crises in the future. 
The Global Fund plays an important role in this funding environment, providing approximately 66% of all current external funds in the fight against TB, 45% in the fight against malaria, and 20% of all external support to combat HIV/AIDS. 
Since the Global Fund was founded three years ago, it has built an impressive track record: approving 310 grants totaling $3.1 billion in 127 countries and disbursing $920 million since 2002. 
Despite the scope of its mission, it has a minimal bureaucracy, which allows for a flexible response to changing needs. 
The Global Fund is not perfect; as with all new organizations, it is experiencing growing pains. 
Yet, issues such as procurement policies, trade-offs between efficiency and ownership, and the balance between government and non-governmental organizations as implementing partners are being addressed through the Fund’s open and inclusive governance systems. 
If the Fund is to live up to its potential it will need $2.3 billion to continue its work effectively in 2005. 
The first of two replenishment conferences for the Global Fund is taking place this week in Stockholm, with the aim of securing financial pledges to cover grant commitments in 2006-2007, as well as to fill the gap for this year. 
Donors have long preached the importance of a funding vehicle such as the Global Fund—one that is needs-driven, relies on local input, and promotes donor coordination. 
They now have a chance to make good on their word. 
With many battles ahead in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria, it would be a disgrace if this opportunity is squandered. 
The Tobin Tax Lives Again 
CAMBRIDGE – Something happened in late August that I never thought I would see in my lifetime. A leading policymaker in the Anglo-American empire of finance actually came out in support of a Tobin tax – a global tax on financial transactions. 
The official in question was Adair Turner, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, the country’s chief financial regulator. 
Turner, voicing his concerns about the size of the financial sector and its frequently obscene levels of compensation, said he thought a global tax on financial transactions might help curb both. 
Such a statement would have been unthinkable in the years before the sub-prime mortgage meltdown. Now, however, it is an indication of how much things have changed. 
The idea of such a tax was first floated in the 1970’s by James Tobin, the Nobel laureate economist, who famously called for “throwing some sand in the wheels of international finance.” 
Tobin was concerned about excessive fluctuations in exchange rates. 
He argued that taxing short-term movements of money in and out of different currencies would curb speculation and create some maneuvering room for domestic macroeconomic management. 
The idea has since become a cause-célèbre for a wide range of non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups that see in it the double virtue of cutting finance down to size and raising a big chunk of revenue for favored causes –foreign aid, vaccines, green technologies, you name it. 
It has also been endorsed by some French (predictably!) and other continental European leaders. 
But, until Turner mentioned the idea, you would not have been able to identify a single major policymaker from the United States or the UK, the world’s two leading centers of global finance, with anything nice to say about it. 
The beauty of a Tobin tax is that it would discourage short-term speculation without having much adverse effect on long-term international investment decisions. 
Consider, for example, a tax of 0.25% applied to all cross-border financial transactions. 
Such a tax would instantaneously kill the intra-day trading that takes place in pursuit of profit margins much smaller than this, as well as the longer-term trades designed to exploit minute differentials across markets. 
Economic activity of this kind is of doubtful social value, yet it eats up real resources in terms of human talent, computing power, and debt. 
So we should not mourn the demise of such trading practices. 
Meanwhile, investors with longer time horizons going after significant returns would not be much deterred by the tax. So capital would still move in the right direction over the longer term. 
Nor would a Tobin tax stand in the way of financial markets punishing governments that grossly mismanage their economies. 
Moreover, it is undeniable that such a tax would raise a great deal of money. 
Revenue estimates for a small tax on international currency transactions run into hundreds of billions of dollars per year. 
The receipts would be even greater if the base is extended, as was implied by Turner, to all global financial transactions. 
Whatever the precise amount, it is safe to say that the numbers in question are huge – larger than, say, foreign-aid flows or any reasonable assessment of the gains from completing the Doha Round of trade negotiations. 
Predictably, Turner came in for severe criticism from City of London bankers and the British Treasury. Much of that criticism misses the mark. 
A Tobin tax would raise the cost of short-term finance, some argued, somehow missing the point that this is in fact the very purpose of a Tobin tax. 
Others argued that such a tax fails to target the underlying incentive problems in financial markets, as if we had an effective, well-proven alternative to achieve that end. 
It would threaten the role of London as a financial center, some complained, as if the proposal was meant to apply just in London and not globally. 
It can easily be evaded by relying on offshore banking centers, some pointed out, as if not all financial regulations face that very same challenge. 
In any case, as Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington observed, there are many imaginative ways in which a Tobin tax could be made harder to dodge. 
Suppose, he argues, that we give finance workers who turn in their cheating bosses 10% of the receipts that the government collects. 
That would be quite an incentive for self-monitoring. 
What the Tobin tax does not do is help with longer-term misalignments in financial markets. 
Such a tax would not have prevented the US-China trade imbalance. 
Neither would it have stopped the global saving glut from turning into a ticking time bomb for the world economy. 
It would not have protected European and other nations from becoming awash in toxic mortgage assets exported from the US. 
And it would not dissuade governments intent on pursuing unsustainable monetary and fiscal policies financed by external borrowing. 
For all of these problems we will need other macroeconomic and financial remedies. 
But a Tobin tax is a good place to start if we want to send a strong message about the social value of the casino known as global finance. 
The Too-Quiet American 
NEW YORK – It is now apparent that the United States is the main culprit in preventing the ten-year-old multilateral trade negotiations known as the Doha Round from being closed this year. 
The US has even spurned World Trade Organization Director General Pascal Lamy’s desperate attempt to get member states to support a wholly emasculated agreement – described by critics as Doha Lite and Decaffeinated – which is mainly confined to some concessions to the least-developed countries. 
While there are bit players who could be cast as villains, America’s ambassador to the WTO, Michael Punke, has assumed the role of global trade’s Mr. No. 
But the problem is not Punke. 
America’s rejectionist stance comes from the top of the US government, starting with President Barack Obama’s lack of leadership. 
From the outset of his presidency, Obama’s defense of a liberal trade regime has been inadequate. 
He has said repeatedly that exports are good for the US: they create jobs. 
But US exports are other nations’ imports, so Obama’s argument amounts to telling others to lose their jobs. 
He needs to remind Americans that imports are also good: he can surely ask his audience to think of jobs in the UPS cargo planes, freight trains, and trucks that carry imports into the American interior. 
The main problem, however, is that Obama has been unable to confront, and put to rest, US labor unions’ fear-driven hostility to trade. 
Nor has he been willing to confront the business lobbies that are willing to hold the Doha Round hostage in order to extract ever more concessions by other countries, even though they know that the trade talks are about to be sucked into the Bermuda Triangle of the 2012 US presidential election. 
Yet there is little in the opposition by fearful unions and greedy business lobbies that Obama could not beat back with compelling arguments. 
Besides, as the respected polling analyst Karlyn Bowman recently demonstrated, the US public is by no means strongly opposed to trade. 
This is partly because, in virtually every state, so many jobs today – and not just at UPS – depend on trade. 
Protectionism may, in fact, be an electoral dinosaur. 
In any event, history’s great statesmen have always earned their spurs by bucking the political odds for a matter of principle. 
If Obama actually wrote less and read more, he would find at least two historical episodes of courageous leadership on trade that are worthy of his admiration and emulation. 
One is the repeal of England’s Corn Laws by Prime Minister Robert Peel in 1848. 
In the critical vote for repeal that brought his political career to an end, Peel won only 106 votes from his Conservative Party, while 222 Tory MPs opposed him. 
He carried the day, but he lost the support of his party. 
As Lord Ashley observed in his diary: “[Peel] led the Tories and followed the Whigs.” 
The other example is Winston Churchill, who was elected as a Conservative member of Parliament from the northern industrial town of Oldham. 
After converting to free trade in 1904, he had to leave the party. 
He then joined the Liberal Party, accepting the invitation of the Liberal Association of Northwest Manchester. 
Churchill was also for free immigration, and firmly opposed the proposed Aliens Bill of 1904 (partly because he saw traces of anti-Semitism in the fear, prompted by an influx of East European Jewish immigrants, of an “alien invasion”). 
Churchill was a politician of principle who, like Peel, fought against his own party and, unlike Peel, survived to go on to yet greater political triumph, in the epic battle against the Nazis. 
These “profiles in courage,” to borrow John F. Kennedy’s famous phrase, ought to inspire Obama at a time when Presidential leadership is a crying need in Washington on critical economic issues. 
Obama campaigned on the slogan “Yes, we can,” not “Yes, we can, but we won’t.” As he watches an American economy assailed by economic ignorance, I have a new and better catchphrase for him: Nec aspera terrent, or “Difficulties be damned.” 
The Ethics of Big Food 
PRINCETON – Last month, Oxfam, the international aid organization, launched a campaign called “Behind the Brands.” 
The goal is to assess the transparency of the world’s ten biggest food and beverage companies concerning how their goods are produced, and to rate their performance on sensitive issues like the treatment of small-scale farmers, sustainable water and land use, climate change, and exploitation of women. 
Consumers have an ethical responsibility to be aware of how their food is produced, and the big brands have a corresponding obligation to be more transparent about their suppliers, so that their customers can make informed choices about what they are eating. 
In many cases, the biggest food companies themselves do not know how they perform on these issues, betraying a profound lack of ethical responsibility on their part. 
Nestlé scored highest on transparency, as they provide information on at least some of their commodity sources and audit systems. 
But even its rating is only “fair.” 
General Mills was at the bottom of the ranking. 
In addition to this lack of transparency, Oxfam’s report identifies several deficiencies common to all of the Big 10 food companies. 
They are not providing small-scale farmers with an equal opportunity to sell into their supply chains, and when small-scale farmers do have the opportunity to sell to the big brands’ suppliers, they may not receive a fair price for their product. 
The Big 10 are also not taking sufficient responsibility to ensure that their larger-scale farm suppliers pay a decent living wage to their workers. 
There are 450 million wage workers in agriculture worldwide, and in many countries they are often inadequately paid, with 60% living in poverty. 
Some of the Big 10 are doing more than others to develop ethical policies in these areas. 
Unilever has committed itself to sourcing more raw materials from small-scale farmers, and has pledged 100% sustainable sourcing for all of its main commodities by 2020. 
This policy gave Unilever the highest score on openness to small farmers, with a rating of “fair.” 
Danone, General Mills, and Kellogg’s were at the bottom, with a rating of “very poor.” 
For many years, Nestlé was criticized for marketing infant formula in developing countries, where breast-feeding was available and much healthier than bottle-feeding. 
It revised its policies in response to that criticism, but more recently has been targeted again for using child and forced labor to produce its cocoa. 
In 2011, the company used the Fair Labor Association to assess its supply chain. 
The assessment confirmed that many of Nestlé’s suppliers were using child and forced labor, and the company has now begun to address the problem. 
As a result, Nestlé, along with Unilever and Coca-Cola, scored “fair” on workers’ rights. 
None of the Big 10 did better. 
Kellogg’s received the lowest score in this category. 
Agriculture is a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions, accounting for more than the entire transport sector, and it is also one of the sectors most at risk from climate change, as recent changes in rainfall patterns have made evident. 
Clearing tropical forests for grazing or palm-oil production releases large quantities of stored carbon into the atmosphere. 
Grazing ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, also contribute significantly to climate change. 
Here, too, the big brands receive low grades from Oxfam, mostly for failing even to track the emissions for which they are directly or indirectly responsible. 
Nestlé was the only company to achieve a “fair” rating, with Associated British Foods at the bottom, with a “very poor” rating. 
Anyone with Internet access can visit Oxfam’s Web site and see how the big brands rank on each of seven ethically significant indicators. 
The highest scores currently are in the “fair” range, with not a single Big 10 company receiving a “good” rating in any category. 
Individual consumers are encouraged to contact the companies directly and urge them to demonstrate greater responsibility for the way in which they obtain the ingredients for their products. 
In this way, Oxfam hopes, its “Behind the Brands” campaign will trigger a “race to the top” in which big corporations compete to achieve the highest possible score, and to become known as truly transparent actors that produce food and beverages with a high degree of ethical responsibility. 
The changes that have already occurred show that if big corporations know that their consumers want them to act more ethically, they will do so. 
To be effective, such a campaign requires individual consumers to take it upon themselves to become better informed about the food and beverages that they consume, to make their voices heard, and to make purchasing choices that are influenced by ethics as well as by taste and price. 
The Torturers of Tashkent 
NEW YORK – President Islam Karimov’s regime in Uzbekistan has survived for 19 years, in no small part because it has resorted time and again to police brutality and torture to extract confessions from people who have committed no crime, and to break the spirits of political opponents and intimidate anyone who might think of becoming one. 
Sometimes the police are overzealous. 
Sometimes the victims die. 
Sometimes the regime tries to cover up the killings. 
But Karimov has never condemned torture, and he has instituted no measures to prevent it. 
A few cases make it to the public eye, but only when things go too far and victims of brutality or torture die. 
The latest to surface is the case of 30-year-old Muzaffar Tuychiyev, a healthy young man when the police detained him on the evening of March 24, 2008, in the region of Tashkent. 
They then transported Tuychiyev to a police station in Angren, 100 kilometers south of the capital. 
By the next morning, Tuychiyev was dead. 
Four police officers are on trial for his killing. 
His parents say higher-ranking officers are going free. 
Talib Yakubov, a human-rights advocate in Uzbekistan, says that torture is an integral part of the Karimov regime’s domestic policy. 
Torture, Yakubov says, enables the government to keep the public in fear and submission. 
The government uses the threat of terrorist attacks to justify domestic repression of political opponents and the absence of democratic reforms. 
But, according to Yakubov, “Only thanks to torture, hundreds and thousands of people admit that they are guilty of religious extremism and terrorism. 
Without torture, none of them would have incriminated themselves.” 
In 2003, the international community tried to persuade Karimov to publicly denounce torture before an annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). 
Two months prior to the gathering, a United Nations special reporter published a paper condemning Uzbekistan for “widespread and systematic” use of torture. 
The report unleashed a wave of criticism of the EBRD for choosing to hold its meeting in Tashkent. 
In response, the EBRD promised to pressure Karimov to condemn torture. 
Karimov, not surprisingly, dodged and weaved instead. 
During a speech at the meeting, he boasted that Uzbekistan was a partner of the United States in the war on terror – and for Karimov the war on terror is tantamount to a license to torture in his quest to remain in power. 
On May 13, 2005, when government troops in the eastern city of Andijan opened fire from armored personnel carriers on thousands of people demonstrating against poverty and abuse of power, the guns killed hundreds of people. 
Thereafter, torture in Uzbekistan became routine. 
No one has managed to speak to a victim of torture in Uzbekistan. 
Dozens have died as a result of their ordeals. 
Most survivors languish in prison. 
Those who have been released prefer to keep silent about their experiences. 
(Psychological research shows that torture causes serious psychological trauma to its victims, whose families often suffer negative consequences as well.) 
I had a chance to see one of the victims of Uzbekistan’s regime. 
Rasul Haitov was 27 years old when he was detained in Tashkent with his brother Ravshan, 32, in October 2001. 
Police officers resorted to torture to get them to admit that they were members of an Islamist party, Hizb-ut Tahrir. 
The police choked the brothers with plastic bags. 
They drove needles under their fingernails, and then tore them out. 
They sodomized them with glass bottles, beat them up with clubs, and threw their bodies around a room. 
Ravshan died. 
Rasul barely survived. 
When I saw him in a courtroom, he was weak and feeble and looked like a broken old man. 
After two months of treatment, he could still not sit upright. 
The Trade-and-Aid Myth 
Trade and aid have become international buzzwords. 
More aid (including debt relief) and greater access to rich countries’ markets for poor countries’ products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda. 
Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but howmuch to do, and how fast. 
Lost in all this are the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development. 
Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves. 
Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts. 
Aid and market access have rarely played a critical role. 
Consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor, which also happens to be the world’s most powerful economy. 
Suppose, in addition, that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of inward investment, and is totally integrated into international production chains. 
Moreover, the country’s banking system is supported by its rich neighbor’s demonstrated willingness to act as a lender of last resort. 
Globalization does not get much better than this, right? 
Now consider a second country. 
This one faces a trade embargo in the world’s largest market, receives neither foreign aid nor any other kind of assistance from the West, is excluded from international organizations like the WTO, and is prevented from borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank. 
If these external disadvantages are not debilitating enough, this economy also maintains its own high barriers on international trade (in the form of state trading, import tariffs, and quantitative restrictions). 
As the reader may have guessed, these are real countries: Mexico and Vietnam. 
Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States, which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor, but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury (as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis). 
By contrast, America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, established diplomatic relations only in 1995, and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that. 
Vietnam still remains outside the WTO. 
Now consider their economic performance. 
Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992, Mexico’s economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1% in per capita terms. 
This is not only far below the rates of Asia’s economic superstars; it is also a fraction of Mexico’s own growth performance during the decades that preceded the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981). 
Vietnam, however, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5% pace since then. 
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell. 
Both countries experienced sharp increases in international trade and foreign investment, but the pictures are utterly different where it counts most: rising standards of living, particularly for the poor. 
What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country’s economic fortunes. 
All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso’s exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy. 
What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy. 
With none of Mexico’s advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers. 
Broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most. 
South Korea took off in the early 1960’s not when foreign aid was at its apex, but when it was being phased out. 
Taiwan did not receive foreign aid or preferential market access. 
China and India, today’s two economic superstars, have prospered largely through sui generis reform efforts. 
It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes – Botswana and Mauritius – to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far. 
Obviously, both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets. 
But, as in other cases of successful development, what distinguishes them is not the external advantages they possess, but their ability to exploit these advantages. 
Witness the mess that other countries made of their natural-resource endowments. 
The word “diamond” hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone. 
Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius. 
None of this absolves rich countries of their responsibility to help. 
They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators – for example, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign. 
Similarly, increasing the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries, and providing greater scope for growth-oriented policies by relaxing WTO rules and conditionality from the US, would produce greater long-term development impact. 
It is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North. 
Development should focus not on trade and aid, but on improving the policy environment in poor countries. 
The Tragedy of President Chen 
Taiwan’s Public Prosecutor has indicted the wife of President Chen Shui-bien for embezzling public funds. 
Chen, as a sitting president, cannot be indicted even though the prosecutor says that he has evidence to prove his guilt. 
But Chen’s legacy was already in tatters. 
Chen can remain in office until his term ends in 2008, or he could resign now in order to let his vice president and pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rebuild to win the next election. 
Whatever his decision, Taiwan’s first DPP president will go down in history as a pathetic failure, because he used his office to divide the island’s citizens, as if his domestic political opponents were Taiwan’s mortal enemies. 
The root of Chen’s moral demise is something the classical Greeks identified: hubris. 
Chen’s popularity among his party followers, whose fervency often bordered on fundamentalism, changed him from a person with deep democratic instincts into a textbook case of a man who regards power and its prerogatives as being his by right. 
Chen once had political courage. 
Jailed years ago for his anti-Kuomintang (KMT) activities, he stood up at great odds to the Chinese Communist Party, which sought in vain to subjugate him in cross-Strait relations and in global politics. 
The world has largely deserted Taiwan and its 23 million people – the only democracy among 1.2 billion Chinese. 
Only 24 countries, mostly tiny island states, maintain diplomatic relations, while all but one of the world’s major powers and all important international institutions, including the United Nations, dance to the mainland’s tune on the issue. 
But Chen’s behavior did not help. 
Indeed, he even angered the United States, Taiwan’s only military protector, by his frequent confrontational tactics, such as pushing Taiwan towards independence, which runs counter to America’s longstanding “One-China” policy. 
After winning the presidency, Chen could have risen above theatrics by focusing on two Taiwanese strengths: its economy and its unbroken humanist Chinese cultural tradition. 
Instead, Chen balked at further integration into the global economy, refusing to open all of Taiwan’s economic sectors to foreign participation, which would have strengthened Taiwan’s competitiveness and efficiency. 
For years, forward looking Taiwanese industrialists, including many hi-tech entrepreneurs, urged Chen to de-bureaucratize and de-politicize Taiwan’s increasingly isolated economy. 
Failing to persuade him, they decamped to mainland China. 
Unwisely, Chen went out of his way to shut out mainland Chinese capital and to retain barriers to other foreign investors in order to protect the domestic businesses of his political allies. 
Indeed, indicators of economic freedom and competitiveness compiled by the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the World Economic Forum, and others show that Taiwan’s relative ranking has stagnated or even declined on Chen’s watch. 
This stands in sharp contrast to the communist mainland, which has reinvented itself to become one of world’s more open, competitive, and dynamic economies. 
As a result, big international corporations and Wall Street banks now flock to China, bypassing Taiwan. 
They do so not because Taiwan is small – witness Hong Kong and Switzerland – but because it retains too many restrictions against foreign institutions. 
Taiwan’s missed opportunity reflects its government’s sheer incompetence, arrogance, and ignorance. 
Chen squandered six valuable years as his administration engaged mainly in polemics with its opposition parties while he pandered to the extreme wing of the DPP and mobilized his government to “de-Sinicize” Taiwan culture. 
Indeed, Chen even argued that the Taiwanese were never Chinese. 
He ordered the Education Ministry to revise school textbooks to promote the idea that the Taiwanese people were fundamentally different, practically a different race from the Chinese. 
Clearly, Chen’s hatred of dictatorship, whether Communist or KMT, consumed him, limiting his ability to think clearly. 
In fact, Taiwan’s moral superiority over mainland China lies not only in its democratic institutions, but also in its unbroken adherence to the ancient culture that the Chinese communists nearly succeeded in annihilating after coming to power in 1949. 
Ironically, it is China’s rulers who are now scrambling to resurrect Confucius as a moral anchor in a culture dominated by the pursuit of money. 
Chen should have celebrated Taiwan’s “Chineseness” proudly and loudly, thereby distinguishing the island from the barbaric legacy of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Instead, Chen’s futile effort to “de-Sinicize” Taiwan created a wastefully divisive contentious society, pitting “mainlanders” and “locals” against each other. 
Chen’s record suggests he will hang on to his failed presidency. 
He will use his legal training to fight on technicalities. 
But to the rest of the world, Chen has been revealed as a petty liar over a pitiful amount of money. 
He and his wife lied about their involvement. 
Their close aides have confessed that they forged documents and perjured themselves to protect their political boss. 
What a pathetic ending for a man who could have become one of the most important leaders in modern Chinese history. 
The Tragedy of Zidane 
Those who the gods may destroy, they grant their wishes. 
Zinedine Zidane may be pondering that bit of ancient Greek wisdom today. 
Having announced that he would end his professional career with the World Cup, Zidane had his wish fulfilled. 
After France barely survived the tournament’s first round, Zidane performed at the top of his game and led the team to the brink of a second World Cup championship. 
But instead of finishing his career in triumph, or at least with an ovation, he was ejected from the final for head-butting an Italian player. 
There have been few such tragic moments in football history. 
Whatever the provocation that led to Zidane’s behavior (probably a racial comment), his violent act, seen around the world, has tarnished his image. 
The sad paradox is that while the world had been learning of and celebrating his legendary kindness as a person, he will now be distinguished for all time by an act of aggression. 
Indeed, Zidane’s status as an emblematic champion of the world’s most universal and popular sport does not fully explain why people have been so obsessed with him. 
His human qualities, as much as his talent and technical feats on the field, counted equally in establishing his popular acclaim. 
Football has always been this way. 
For Argentineans, the diminutive Diego Maradona represented the revenge of the weak and the deprived. 
As a result, his countrymen excused his frequent bad behavior time and again. 
Similarly, Pelé became the symbol of a harmonious, inter-racial Brazil. 
Zidane offered neither of these romantic images. 
Moreover, after his career is over, he is unlikely to become a manager of his sport like Jean-Claude Killy, the former Alpine skier who was co-president of the 1992 winter Olympics, or his fellow football legend Michel Platini, who helped coordinate the 1998 World Cup. 
After all, Zidane, arguably the world’s best football player, left with a gesture that has no place in any game. 
Nevertheless, Zidane will remain a global icon, owing to his profoundly human character and his extreme simplicity. 
Here is a man who is known in the most hidden corners of the planet, yet he retained the presence and discretion of a silent next-door neighbor. 
At a moment when integration is being debated in France, Zidane embodied the ideal of success through talent and hard work – while never betraying himself or his Algerian origins. 
Moreover, Zidane incarnated values that seem threatened nowadays, but to which ordinary people remain attached: loyalty to family, diligence, and cooperation. 
Here is a man who was not only a world champion, but also a model son and father. 
The almost timid way in which, after France’s victory over Spain, he expressed his love for his mother touched viewers around the world. 
To understand Zidane’s popularity, one need only set his modesty and attention to others against the arrogance and indifference that characterize the behavior of so many other celebrities, including football players. 
At a time when, in France as in the rest of the world, the chasm between the elite and ordinary people has never been so wide, when the smugness of the affluent has never been so cruelly felt by the less fortunate, Zidane, a son of despised immigrants, became an international star, and yet preserved the simplicity of his origins. 
For this, Zidane was not only admired, but also respected. 
His success was never to the detriment of others. 
On the contrary, he is active in causes such as helping sick children. 
It is obvious that he could one day become a tremendous ambassador of peace, or for children, working with the United Nations or another international organization. 
But now the hero has fallen. 
Zidane was not Superman, but a human being. 
In a single instant of unfathomable fury, his moment of glory was transformed into one of madness and a curse. 
His tragedy is ultimately a personal one. 
Nevertheless, it would be a great loss – extending far beyond the world of football – if Zidane’s disgraceful exit as a player comes to define his legacy as a man. 
The Tragic Cost of Being Unscientific 
PRINCETON – Throughout his tenure as South Africa’s president, Thabo Mbeki rejected the scientific consensus that AIDS is caused by a virus, HIV, and that antiretroviral drugs can save the lives of people who test positive for it. 
Instead, he embraced the views of a small group of dissident scientists who suggested other causes for AIDS. 
Mbeki stubbornly continued to embrace this position even as the evidence against it became overwhelming. 
When anyone – even Nelson Mandela, the heroic resistance fighter against apartheid who became South Africa’s first black president – publicly questioned Mbeki’s views, Mbeki’s supporters viciously denounced them. 
While Botswana and Namibia, South Africa’s neighbors, provided anti-retrovirals to the majority of its citizens infected by HIV, South Africa under Mbeki failed to do so. 
A team of Harvard University researchers has now investigated the consequences of this policy. 
Using conservative assumptions, it estimates that, had South Africa’s government provided the appropriate drugs, both to AIDS patients and to pregnant women who were at risk of infecting their babies, it would have prevented 365,000 premature deaths. 
That number is a revealing indication of the staggering costs that can arise when science is rejected or ignored. 
It is roughly comparable to the loss of life from the genocide in Darfur, and close to half of the toll from the massacre of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. 
One of the key incidents in turning world opinion against South Africa’s apartheid regime was the 1961 Sharpeville massacre, in which police fired on a crowd of black protesters, killing 69 and wounding many more. 
Mbeki, like Mandela, was active in the struggle against apartheid. 
Yet the Harvard study shows that he is responsible for the deaths of 5,000 times as many black South Africans as the white South African police who fired on the crowd at Sharpeville. 
How are we to assess a man like that? 
In Mbeki’s defense, it can be said that he did not intend to kill anyone. 
He appears to have genuinely believed – and perhaps still believes – that anti-retrovirals are toxic. 
We can also grant that Mbeki was not motivated by malice against those suffering from AIDS. 
He had no desire to harm them, and for that reason, we should judge his character differently from those who do set out to harm others, whether from hatred or to further their own interests. 
But good intentions are not enough, especially when the stakes are so high. 
Mbeki is culpable, not for having initially entertained a view held by a tiny minority of scientists, but for having clung to this view without allowing it to be tested in fair and open debate among experts. 
When Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, South Africa’s leading black immunologist, warned that the president’s policies would make South Africa a laughingstock in the world of science, Mbeki’s office accused him of defending racist Western ideas. 
Since Mbeki’s ouster in September, the new South African government of Kgalema Motlanthe has moved quickly to implement effective measures against AIDS. 
Mbeki’s health minister, who notoriously suggested that AIDS could be cured by the use of garlic, lemon juice, and beetroot, was promptly fired. 
The tragedy is that the African National Congress, South Africa’s dominant political party, was so much in thrall to Mbeki that he was not deposed many years ago. 
The lessons of this story are applicable wherever science is ignored in the formulation of public policy. 
This does not mean that a majority of scientists is always right. 
The history of science clearly shows the contrary. 
Scientists are human and can be mistaken. 
They, like other humans, can be influenced by a herd mentality, and a fear of being marginalized. 
The culpable failure, especially when lives are at stake, is not to disagree with scientists, but to reject science as a method of inquiry. 
Mbeki must have known that, if his unorthodox views about the cause of AIDS and the efficacy of anti-retrovirals were wrong, his policy would lead to a large number of unnecessary deaths. 
That knowledge put him under the strongest obligation to allow all the evidence to be fairly presented and examined without fear or favor. 
Because he did not do this, Mbeki cannot escape responsibility for hundreds of thousands of deaths. 
Whether we are individuals, corporate heads, or government leaders, there are many areas in which we cannot know what we ought to do without assessing a body of scientific evidence. 
The more responsibility we hold, the more tragic the consequences of making the wrong decision are likely to be. 
The Transatlantic Blame Game 
As if the diplomatic spat over Iraq weren't bad enough, relations between America and Europe are being slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies. 
Indeed, the differences between the two sides' economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades. 
At first glance, the depth of this ``policy gap'' seems surprising. 
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 has improved recently both in the US and Europe. 
Moreover, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: encouraging economic recovery. 
But their governments' actions--or lack of action--make it seem as if neither side can see the problems faced by the other. 
When the Euro was introduced, most EU members--Germany, in particular--looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure. 
Thus, today's framework in Euro area, with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy, was not constructed to facilitate macroeconomic coordination with the US. 
But the perception of many American observers was different. 
They saw the central implication of the Euro as requiring Europe to junk its supposed role as a ``free rider'' in the international economy, one that left the US shouldering the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth. 
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America. 
These two views were bound to conflict, and now they do. 
Tensions hidden during the long Clinton-era boom rose throughout 2001, when America tried to address its economic downturn by rapidly easing its monetary and fiscal policies. 
As big budget deficits returned, so did European skepticism about the sustainability of America's mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar. 
American critics, meanwhile, saw the Euro area as overly cautious for cutting interest rates slowly and maintaining the fiscal constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Initially, the Europeans underestimated the slowdown they confronted. 
Subsequently, they were constrained by the limits to their fiscal reactions embodied in the Maastricht Treaty; the large economies of Continental Europe had not done enough budgetary consolidation during the years of good growth. 
Both monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth, but Europe did not help much to redress America's external imbalance. 
Of course, the Euro area is so large a player that it can no longer leave responsibility for stimulating global growth to America. 
But US efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration: the issues confronting the European economies are different from those facing the US--as are perceptions about the challenges. 
In fact, the main reasons for the massive swing in US public finances--from surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4% in 2003-04--have little to do with stabilization. 
Aside from the costs of the Iraq war and other security concerns, along with lapses in earlier spending controls, US tax cuts have structural and distributional rather than short-term aims. 
A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the largest benefits upon the most affluent, whose spending is less sensitive to taxes. 
The cuts should sustain private demand this year and next, but at the cost of postponing improvements in private saving and indebtedness. 
Although the dollar has been depreciating for a year, continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5% of GDP. 
As the deficit widens further, dollar depreciation will likely resume, despite laggardly performances by the world's other major economies. 
Will the US accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004, and could Europe make a greater contribution to global growth? 
Probably not. 
The counterpart to the US emphasis on self-reliance rather than direct public assistance is that employment must be maintained at high levels--regardless of the party in power--whereas most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8% or more. 
So the US is likely to opt for growth. 
Despite three years of weak growth, the gap between potential and actual output in Continental Europe's largest economies is currently smaller than in the US. 
Income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable, given high rates in Europe's largest economies. 
But tax cuts that must soon be reversed--due mainly to demographic pressure on public pensions and healthcare--are unlikely to stimulate demand as consumers lose confidence in government's ability to control deficits. 
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management, not inflation. 
The EU countries are finally accelerating their implementation of structural reforms, but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too entrenched, as illustrated by the recent conflicts over reforms of French pensions and the German labor market. 
Further dollar depreciation as well as slower US growth will undermine EU exports, the one relatively successful component of demand in Europe. 
The divergence in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in both Europe and the US for the next year or so. 
But the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation, potentially as divisive as the disputes over the Iraq war. 
If so, the ongoing Doha Round of international trade negotiations could be first to suffer. 
Protectionism will be harder to resist on both sides of the Atlantic. 
The US cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit, while complaints about loss of competitiveness will intensify in the EU. 
It strains the imagination to think that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly. 
The Transatlantic Free-Trade Imperative 
VIENNA – The confirmation of Michael Froman as the US Trade Representative is a fitting moment to highlight the many opportunities that a free-trade agreement between the European Union and the United States would offer Europe, America, and the world. 
Today’s three-tier global economy – 6% growth in emerging markets, 2% growth in the US, and no growth in Europe – shows ominous signs of paralysis and nationalistic unilateralism. 
Many see currency wars looming. 
In such an economically insecure global environment, riddled with protectionist booby traps, a free-trade pact between the world’s two largest trading blocs, accounting for roughly 40% of global GDP, has never been more important. 
Historically, free trade and economic growth have gone together, as have protectionism and stagnation, and deeper trade integration of the US and EU economies would strengthen growth on both sides of the Atlantic. 
The US economy’s projected 2% growth this year, despite a 1.8%-of-GDP cut in government spending, implies real private-sector growth of 3.8%. 
Although both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have actively intervened to boost economic recovery, the results could not be more different. 
In the US, the banking crisis was tackled rapidly and in a sustainable manner, while Europe is still going from one bailout to the next. 
Moreover, America’s stimulus program obviously worked (notwithstanding criticism from the left for being too small, and attacks from the right for being too large). 
Another contributing factor may be a basic difference in mentality: many Europeans tend to over-emphasize risk when assessing opportunities. 
In any case, America is the first country in the recession-stricken part of the global economy where public stimulus has led to enough private investment and growth that fiscal consolidation has become possible. 
The more America and the EU grow together, the more the EU will benefit from the US recovery. 
Demand for European goods will increase, and the EU’s member states can – and should – align their economies with US growth. 
History suggests that the hope for a self-sustained recovery in Europe might well prove deceptive; almost always, the European economic cycle has followed and reinforced that of the US. 
Today, for example, a prolonged recession in Europe is, alongside budget cuts, generally seen as posing the greatest risk to a sustained US recovery. 
Labor costs in the US industrial sector are currently 25% lower than the European average. 
Even more significant, however, are the differences in energy costs, which are now up to 50% lower in the US – a gap that is likely to widen further as America’s shale-gas revolution continues. 
This has led energy-intensive European industries – including producers of glass, steel, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals – to invest heavily in the US. 
Often, they manufacture high-quality upstream products, which are then processed further in Europe. 
The Austrian steel producer Voestalpine AG, for example, will start producing steel pellets in the southern US that will then be upgraded to high-quality alloys in Austria. 
The combination of lower production costs in the US and Europe’s world-class finishing capabilities is a recipe for first-rate products at competitive prices. 
In this way, European investment is contributing to the re-industrialization of the US while simultaneously ensuring high-quality European jobs. 
But Europe must do more to reinvigorate its own manufacturing sector. 
The last attempt to create an EU-US free-trade zone, under President Bill Clinton, failed because of the EU’s rigid, antiquated agricultural policy. 
A new effort would help Europe to replace its agricultural policy with a research-and-development policy aimed at boosting industrial competitiveness. 
Despite all the lip service paid at multilateral summits to policy coordination, imbalances within the global economy are fueling a rise in tensions. 
At a time when many are seeking salvation in nationalism, an EU-US free-trade zone would be a powerful symbol of cooperation in overcoming global challenges. 
The increasing economic weight of Asia is also a geopolitical game-changer. 
China’s massive arms build-up shows that economic power without military power is only a temporary phenomenon. 
So the focus in world politics is shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific. 
Europe should know where it belongs. 
An EU-US free-trade zone would strengthen transatlantic political bonds and effectively refute the frequent lament that America has lost interest in Europe. 
In his second inaugural address, President Barack Obama called an EU-US free-trade zone a core project of his second term. 
Secretary of State John Kerry repeated this during his visit to Germany this spring. 
Now it is up to export-oriented EU countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Austria to press for action on the American offer of negotiations. 
Europe has engaged in navel-gazing for long enough. 
Its malaise has raised questions about whether its democratic capitalism will survive the economic challenge posed by authoritarian and quasi-authoritarian regimes. 
I, for one, prefer making political decisions to wallowing in doubt and self-pity. 
A transatlantic trade pact would align both economies with the fundamental interests of the West. 
The Transatlantic Index 
How should we assess the state of transatlantic relations nowadays? 
With a nod to Wall Street, we can say that the Alliance is up, Europe is flat, and the United States is clearly down. 
The Alliance is “up” for one key reason: the warming of France’s relations with the US following Nicolas Sarkozy’s election as French president. 
For the first time since Charles de Gaulle established the Fifth Republic, France’s priority is no longer to live in opposition to the US. 
The signs of this shift are profound, even spectacular. 
From a toughening of France’s position on Iran to a real warming of relations with Israel, not to mention symbolic gestures like Sarkozy’s summer vacation in America, or Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner’s arrival in Baghdad, this is a New France, one seriously considering a return to NATO’s integrated military structure. 
France’s shift is the result of both political calculus and deeply felt emotion. 
For Sarkozy, the French are not anti-Americans, but simply anti-Bush. 
In his willingness to break with the past – in particular with Jacques Chirac’s legacy – and in adding a global spin to his “mandate for change,” Sarkozy is paving the way for the post-Bush America that will soon be here. 
He knows that the “return of France” as an influential actor in Europe presupposes a France that is closer to America, which will automatically bring France closer to Germany and Great-Britain, not to mention Poland and Italy. 
Emotionally, too, “Sarkozy the American, Sarkozy the doer,” who wants to be judged by his actions, tends to see himself as a Gallic incarnation of the American dream. 
He is the son of immigrants, the outsider whose rise to the top is living proof of French openness. 
In the US, too, the attitude towards the alliance with Europe has changed mightily. 
The failure in Iraq, the risk of an “Iraqization” of Afghanistan, and Russia’s newfound assertiveness have moved America from the arrogant indifference that characterized most of Bush’s presidency to a rediscovery of the Alliance’s value. 
America needs allies, and is not preoccupied by their potential independent strength. 
As one top American diplomat put it, “The last worry I have when I wake up at three in the morning is that Europe is becoming too strong.” 
But rapprochement between France and the US should not hide other realities. 
First, in Afghanistan, NATO is in danger of suffering its first military defeat. 
Where will the new troops that are needed come from? 
And a key member of the Alliance, Turkey, may be about to embark in a dangerous military adventure in Kurdish northern Iraq. 
Second, one cannot speak of NATO without noting that the Alliance’s twin pillars – Europe and the US – are not in great shape. 
If Europe is “flat,” one reason is Sarkozy. 
He may be encouraging news for the Alliance, his European policy is a source of worry for Europe. 
While Sarkozy claims that Europe is his priority, his methods seem to contradict his intentions. 
The difficult personal chemistry he has with German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reinforced by his constant attacks on the European Central Bank and its president, Jean-Claude Trichet. 
One cannot simultaneously defend the Alliance in the name of Europe and weaken Europe with fits of populism and economic nationalism. 
Europe’s three key new leaders – Britain’s Gordon Brown, Merkel, and Sarkozy – all belong to a generation that is no longer emotionally moved by the project of European integration. 
Their links with Europe – if they exist at all – are at best rational, not emotional. 
But will cool rationality be enough to create a European security pillar within the context of the Alliance? 
As for America, it is “down” in terms of both “soft” ideological power and “hard” military power. 
The US remains by far the world’s strongest country, particularly in military terms, but it is confronted with fundamental questions about the use and utility of force at a time when power is relative. 
Today, Americans and Europeans alike must demonstrate modesty. 
Unlike when the Alliance was created, a multi-polar world system has taken shape, in which the West’s demographic and economic share has fallen, and in which it must now compete with successful authoritarian models such as China or even Russia. 
In this new context, solidarity is as crucial as ever. 
Opinion about the US remains largely negative in Europe, and will remain so at least until the US presidential election in 2008. 
Likewise, US perceptions of France and of Europe are only slowly improving. 
It is only by respecting our common values and not exacerbating our differences that the West will be able to reinvent itself. 
The Alliance may be “up,” but its outlook remains uncertain. 
The Transatlantic Muslim Divide 
Compared with the tension that exists in Muslim communities across Europe, America’s Muslims are a more contented lot. 
A recent Pew Forum study found Europe’s Muslims to be “markedly less well off than the general population, frustrated with economic opportunities and socially isolated,” while most American Muslims say that “their communities are excellent or good places” to live; 71% say they can succeed in the US if they work. 
Both income and college graduation levels match the national norms. 
63% of American Muslims report no conflict between religious devotion and living in modern society. 
Although 53% of US Muslims think that life is more difficult since the terrorist attacks of 2001, most think that this is the fault of the government, not their neighbors. 
Indeed, 73% said they had never experienced discrimination while living in America. 
Moreover, 85% said suicide bombing is rarely or never justified, and only 1% said violence to defend Islam was “often” permissible. 
In Europe, significantly higher percentages of Muslims believe that suicide bombings are “often” or “sometimes” justified. 
“What emerges,” according to Amaney Jamal, an adviser to Pew, “is the great success of the Muslim American population in its socioeconomic assimilation.” Yet “assimilation” is not what succeeds. 
America’s Muslims do not so much assimilate as participate in economic, political, educational, and social life. 
This might reflect a self-selection process: only the most educated Muslims immigrate to America, as poor social services allow only the best-prepared to survive. 
Yet even middle-class Muslims in Britain become alienated, and, unlike the Muslim poor in Europe, poor Muslims in America don’t express alienation or sympathy with al-Qaeda. 
It can be argued that only those poor eager for the harsh but open possibilities of American life immigrate to the US. 
Yet this doesn’t explain why these poorer immigrants remain religious; wanting to succeed US-style, they should want to be quick to “assimilate.” 
Why do US Muslims do well while remaining devout and distinctive-looking? 
Why can they participate without assimilating? 
Two factors seem significant: first, relatively porous economic, political and educational arenas that allow immigrants entry to these key areas of American life. 
Despite the discrimination and poverty that immigrants often suffer initially, barriers to economic and political participation are relatively low. 
The second factor is America’s pluralistic public sphere, an arena not without religion but with many religions, which are visible and active in civil life as the basis for institutions, publications, and symbols that influence values and conduct. 
The US is not a secular society; it is a religiously pluralistic one with secular legal and political structures. 
Indeed, America’s secular institutions were designed to support pluralism. 
They allow people of many creeds to work in them—a workplace of multiple faiths. 
The prohibition against a state religion together with freedom of conscience preserves the plurality of religion in civil life. 
This design was crafted not only from enlightened principle but from necessity: America needed to persuade people to cross the ocean and endure the hardships of the frontier and, later, industrialization. 
Freedom to practice one’s religion was an advertisement for America. 
The benefit of that accidental generosity was the American deal: immigrants have to participate in the economic and political fracas of the nation, but without much of a social service safety “net.” 
On the other hand, they can get in. 
And they can keep not only their private faith but practice it publicly. 
Tolerance for other people’s religion is the price paid for tolerance of one’s own. 
Prejudice has tended to fall as participation increases. It has been in no one’s interest to disturb this live-and let-live pragmatism for very long. 
One result of the deal is the paradoxical-sounding “familiarity with difference.” Because immigrants participate in America’s economic and political arenas, Americans are used to different sorts of people and so distinguish those differences that might damage the country from those that will not. 
Americans, indeed, are familiar with difference, or at least they tend not to panic. 
Even after 2001, there were only a few anti-Muslim incidents. 
Europe, however, demands greater assimilation and offers a less porous economy and politics. 
This means less participation and thus less familiarity with difference on the host country’s side. 
On the immigrants’ side, there is more resentment against the host, more lassitude about the economy and politics, possible violence or an insistence on maintaining symbolic differences—ironically, in a society less able to accept them precisely because of its discomfort with difference. 
This is Europe’s headscarf debate in a nutshell. 
It speaks to none of the barriers to participation or to immigrant responses to them, but demands symbolic assimilation. 
But such demands are a dead end. 
To get out of it, greater entry into the economy and politics is needed, but also less demand for quick-fix assimilation. 
All the religions that descend from Abraham have internal mechanisms for change that allow them to reckon with new circumstances in ways that the confessional community can respect. 
Both fundamentalism and the demands of assimilation — be like us, now! — pre-empt these mechanisms. 
They should be allowed to work. 
But Europe demands assimilation before participation in an economy that immigrants can’t get into anyway. 
This, sadly, is a road to the ghetto. 
The New Obama 
NEW YORK – After the second debate between US President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, Obama’s supporters chorused in near-unison, “He’s back!” The languid, disengaged, and lackluster performer of the first debate had disappeared, and the impressive, beloved figure of the victorious 2008 campaign had reappeared. 
As the commentator Andrew Sullivan put it, “I saw the person I first saw...I saw the president I thought I knew.” 
To my eye, however, the old Obama was not back. 
A new Obama had appeared. 
The old Obama was youthful, charming, graceful, and full of hope. 
His demeanor was crisp yet easy-going. 
His rhetoric soared. 
His smile could light up a stadium. 
The Obama on display in the second debate – and the third – was harder, chillier, sadder, and more somber. 
There was tension in the lines of his mouth. 
His speech was clipped, as if under continuous rigorous control. 
His rhetoric did not soar, could not soar. 
The smile was rare and constrained. 
But his command of detail and argument was rock solid. 
His sentences parsed. 
He spoke with a cold, disciplined energy. 
In repose (as witnessed on the split screen in the reaction shots) he was often perfectly immobile, almost stony, as if posing for a portrait. 
One word for all of this would be “presidential,” in the sense of competent, seasoned, and sobered by reality. 
But that word also connotes the fearsome qualities of ruthlessness and brutality that any honest portrayal of the office of President of the United States must include in our day. 
Obama has inhabited the White House for four years; now the White House inhabits him. 
Twice this autumn, Obama had already performed before tens of millions of people – in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention and in the first debate. 
Each time, his performance was flat. 
At the convention, he seemingly hoped to summon the old Obama, to charm and soar, but that man was simply no longer available. 
The truth appears to be that his muse deserted him sometime in the first year of his presidency. 
The result was a simulacrum of the old Obama, as if he were acting the part of himself. 
Then, in the first debate, no such futile effort was even made, and there was no Obama at all, neither old nor new. 
As so many commentators noted, in some sense he simply failed to show up. 
Perhaps he also thought that, well ahead in the polls, he did not have to bother to engage the pesky fellow who imagined replacing him in the White House. 
At the second debate, the loss of the old Obama was apparently accepted and a new one –existing, real, available, and now working in the Oval Office – made its first appearance. 
Has the presidency hardened Obama? 
Has it brutalized him? 
There are reasons for thinking that it has. 
First, Obama has taken, perhaps, a heavier beating from his political opposition than most presidents. 
The theme of Obama’s life, clearly expressed in his eloquent memoir Dreams from My Father, and shown in the recent Frontline documentary The Choice, is reconciliation. 
He is not a man whose identity was handed to him by birth. 
Born of a white mother and an absentee Kenyan father, residing in Indonesia as a boy, raised in adolescence by a white single mother in Hawaii, he was forced to figure out his place in life on his own. 
He found it in the idea of reconciliation – both racial and ideological. 
That was the theme of his defining speech at the Democratic convention in 2004, with its famous line, “There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; there is the United States of America.” 
It was to be the theme of his presidency. 
So, when an ideologically implacable Republican opposition, in his very first days in office, threw the vision back in his face, adopting a policy of scorched-earth opposition, the rejection was about more than policy – it affected his very being. 
The dreams from his father were at an end, and he was left, as he only slowly realized, with the themeless pragmatism that has become the hallmark of his administration. 
Unable to find common ground with the Republican opposition, he cut deals with the other powers that immediately surround the presidency: the military and security apparatus, big pharmaceutical companies, big banks, and big media. 
Perhaps more important was the permission that he gave himself for violence and suppression of rights: drone strikes that have killed children as well as terrorists, the futile “surge” in Afghanistan, the continued operation of the prison at Guantánamo Bay, reliance on military tribunals, an unprecedented campaign against whistle blowers, and the assertion of a right to order the assassination of foreigners and Americans alike at his sole discretion. 
All this, too, stood behind the performance of the man on stage during the second two debates. 
And if he is elected, it is this man who will govern. 
The Obama of 2008 is not back. 
He is not coming back. 
The Transition to Sustainability 
NEW YORK – The global economic crisis will be with us for a generation, not just a year or two, because it is really a transition to sustainability. 
The scarcity of primary commodities and damage from climate change in recent years contributed to the destabilization of the world economy that gave rise to the current crisis. 
Soaring food and fuel prices and major natural disasters played an important role in undermining financial markets, household purchasing power, and even political stability. 
Viewed in this way, an essential policy that developed and developing countries should pursue in overcoming the crisis is to build infrastructure suitable for the twenty-first century. 
This includes an efficient electricity grid fed by renewable energy; fiber and wireless networks that carry telephony and broadband Internet; water, irrigation, and sewerage systems that efficiently use and recycle fresh water; urban and inter-city public transit systems; safer highways; and networks of protected natural areas that conserve biodiversity and the habitats of threatened species. 
These investments are needed in the short term to offset the decline in worldwide consumption spending that underlies the global recession. 
More importantly, they are needed in the long term, because a world crowded with 6.8 billion people (and rising) simply cannot sustain economic growth unless it adopts sustainable technologies that economize on scarce natural resources. 
In practice, the global crisis means that sustainable investments are being curtailed rather than expanded in the developing world. 
As access to international bank loans, bond flotations, and foreign direct investment is lost, infrastructure projects talked about in the past are now being shelved, threatening the political and economic stability of dozens of developing countries. 
In fact, every part of the world has a huge backlog of vital infrastructure investments. 
It is time for a concerted global effort to bring those projects on line. 
This is not easy to do. 
Most infrastructure investment requires public-sector leadership to forge partnerships with the private sector. 
Typically, the public sector must enter into contractual agreements with private firms not only to build the infrastructure, but also to operate it as a regulated monopoly or on a concession basis. 
Governments generally lack the needed technical capacity to design such projects, opening up possibilities of favoritism and corruption when major contracts are awarded. 
Such charges are likely to be hurled at governments even when they are not true, though all too often they are. 
Still, the backlog of such projects is now wreaking havoc with the world economy. 
The world’s major cities are clogged with traffic jams and pollution. 
The atmosphere is filling with greenhouse gases from heavy use of fossil fuels. 
Water scarcity is hitting virtually every major economic center, from North America to Europe, Africa, India, and China. 
Governments should thus strengthen their ministries of infrastructure (including power, roads, water and sanitation, and information and communication technologies), as well as their national development banks, so that they can properly design long-term infrastructure projects and programs. 
The ability to offset the crisis in a constructive manner through expanded public-private partnerships will determine the subsequent success of countries and regions. 
Interestingly, the US is about to create a National Infrastructure Bank for the first time. 
Nevertheless, American and European economic advisers generally believe that a short sharp stimulus will be enough to restore economic growth. 
This is wrong. 
What will be needed is an overhaul of the world economy towards sustainability. 
Moreover, policymakers in the rich world believe that they can continue to neglect the developing world, or leave it to its fate in global markets. 
This is also a recipe for global failure, and even future conflict. 
Developed countries will have to do far more to help poor countries through the transition to sustainability. 
Whereas most of the “stimulus” legislation to date has been short-term and inward-looking, increased funding for sustainable infrastructure in poor countries would provide a powerful boost to rich-world economies. 
Developed countries should agree to channel considerable savings to developing countries to finance the scale-up of sustainable investments. This can be done directly on a bilateral basis, for example, through long-term loans from developed countries’ export-credit agencies. 
It can also be done multilaterally, by raising the infrastructure investment flows from the World Bank and the regional development banks (including the Inter-American Development Bank, European Investment Bank, African Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank). 
Both channels should be used. 
Developed countries also fail to recognize that without much greater financing of sustainable infrastructure in the developing world – especially sustainable power generation and transmission – a global agreement on climate change later this year (or any time soon) will be impossible. 
The rich world somehow expects poor countries to restrict their use of fossil fuels without any significant help in financing new and sustainable sources of energy. 
In almost all of the rich-country proposals about targets, limits, commitments, and permits for greenhouse gases, there is hardly a word about helping poor countries to finance the transition to sustainable technologies. 
The G-20 meeting in London on April 2 offers hope for a true global effort to repair the failing world economy. 
This is the time and place to launch the global drive toward sustainability. 
The Treason of the Economists 
LONDON – All epoch-defining events are the result of conjunctures – the correlation of normally unconnected events that jolt humanity out of a rut. 
Such conjunctures create what the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls “Black Swans” – unpredictable events with a vast impact. 
A small number of Black Swans, Taleb believes, “explain almost everything in our world.” 
The prosperity of the first age of globalization before 1914, for example, resulted from a successful constellation of developments: falling transport and communication costs, the technological breakthroughs of the second industrial revolution, the pacific state of international relations, and Great Britain’s successful management of the gold standard. 
By contrast, in the interwar years poisonous international politics combined with global economic imbalances to create the Great Depression and set the scene for World War II. 
Now consider recent financial innovations. 
On the back of the new computer and telecommunications technology, a giant market for derivative instruments was built. 
Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs, mainly tied to mortgages) made a new population of aspiring homeowners supposedly creditworthy by enabling the originating banks to sell “sub-prime” debt to other investors. 
Before securitization, banks typically held mortgages; now they could get them off their books. 
But securitized credit taken off one bank’s balance sheet usually ended up on another bank’s books. 
What resulted was a wonderful system for diversifying individual bank risk, but only by magnifying the default risk of all banks that held what came to be called “toxic” debt. 
Because all the derivatives were based on the same assets, if anything happened to those assets, all the banks holding the debt would find themselves in the same soup. 
What made the spread of derivatives possible was the ease with which the volume of debt for a given set of real assets could be expanded. 
This scalability was magnified by the use of credit default swaps (CDSs), which offered phony insurance against default. 
Since an unlimited number of CDSs could be sold against each borrower, the supply of swaps could grow much faster than the supply of bonds. 
CDSs magnified the size of the bubble by hugely speeding up the velocity of monetary circulation. 
The CDO market grew from $275 billion to $4.7 trillion from 2000 to 2006, whereas the CDS market grew four times faster, from $920 billion in 2001 to $62 trillion by the end of 2007. 
CDSs were the means by which derivatives found their way into the portfolios of banks all over the world. 
But the dependence of the whole structure on continually rising house prices was rarely made explicit. If the housing market started to fail, these paper assurances of safety would become, in Warren Buffett’s words, “financial weapons of mass destruction.” 
But financial intermediation would never have brought disaster (or indeed gone so far) save for the global imbalances arising from America’s twin trade and budget deficits, financed to a large extent by Chinese savings. 
Floating exchange rates were supposed to prevent countries from manipulating their currencies, but, by accumulating large quantities of US treasury bills, East Asian countries, especially China, kept their exchange rates artificially low. 
This East Asian “savings glut” enabled a debt-fuelled consumption glut in the US, Britain, and much of the Western world. 
But the marriage between Chinese savings and American consumption had a fatal flaw: it created non-repayable debts. 
Chinese investments increasingly took the form of official purchases of US Treasury bills. 
These investments did not create new resources to provide the means of repayment. 
For the counterpart of the US debt build-up was the relocation of much American manufacturing capacity to China. 
Chinese savings flowed not into creating new assets, but into financial speculation and consumer binges. 
“Surplus” Chinese savings made possible America’s credit expansion between 2003-2005, when the federal funds rate (the overnight rate at which US banks lend to one another) was held at 1%. 
Ultra-cheap money produced a surge in sub-prime mortgage lending – a market that collapsed when interest rates increased steadily after 2005, reaching 5%.The financial crisis of 2008 was the start of a highly painful, but inevitable, process of de-leveraging. 
This interpretation of the origins of the present slump is disputed by the ‘money glut’ school. 
In their view, there was one cause, and one cause only of the crisis: the excessive credit creation that took place when Alan Greenspan was chairman of the US Federal Reserve. 
This view draws on the ‘Austrian’ theory of booms and slumps, and also Milton Friedman’s explanation of the Great Depression of 1929. 
It was wrong then, and it is wrong now. 
This line of reasoning assumes that markets are perfectly efficient. 
If they go wrong, it must be because of mistakes in policy. 
This view is also self-contradictory, for if market participants are perfectly rational and perfectly informed, they would not have been fooled by a policy of making money cheaper than it really was. 
Greenspan is the sacrifice they offer to the god of the market. 
This suggests a more fundamental reason for the economic crisis: the dominance of the Chicago school of economics, with its belief in the self-regulating properties of unfettered markets. This belief justified, or rationalized, the de-regulation of financial markets in the name of the so called “efficient-market hypothesis.” 
It led directly to the spread of financial risk-management models, which, by excluding the possibility of default, grossly underestimated the amount of risk in the system. 
If we are going pursue the blame game, I blame economists more than bankers for the crisis. 
They established the system of ideas that bankers, politicians, and regulators applied. 
John Maynard Keynes wrote that “practical men who believe themselves to be quite immune from intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” 
Most of today’s crop of economists are not defunct, but continue to work in the ideological vicinity of Chicago. 
The Treason of the Magistrates 
PARIS – In democracies, justice is supposed to be independent. 
Some prosecutors and investigating magistrates, however, conveniently forget this. 
Indeed many among them are deeply enmeshed in politics, pursuing agendas – and vendettas – of their own. 
The phenomenon of politicized prosecutors and investigating magistrates is becoming global, arising in democracies as diverse as Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Turkey, and Argentina. 
In all these countries, prosecutors and magistrates hurl accusations of corruption against governments and ruling parties – charges that also happen to suit the political and institutional interests of the magistrates. 
Japan ’s state prosecutor has, for example, accused Ichiro Ozawa, the General-Secretary of the newly elected Democratic Party of Japan, of having received illegal funds to run the DPJ’s recent campaign against the Liberal Democratic Party. 
That three close aides to Ozawa have been indicted only months after the DPJ’s victory strikes many Japanese as odd, given the well known corruption of the LDP when in power. 
But the LDP worked hand in glove with Japan’s deeply entrenched bureaucracy, of which the prosecutors are a part. 
The DPJ has vowed to shake up the cozy relations between Japan’s bureaucrats, politicians, and big business. 
By indicting people close to Ozawa, the prosecutors appear to be acting in defense of the status quo . 
In Italy, prosecutors in Rome, following the lead of their colleagues in Milan, are now going after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
Italy’s investigating magistrates have consistently refused to accept the popularity and electoral power of a business tycoon whom they have tried to convict for many years. 
Berlusconi may not be the most refined of Italians, but after many trials it has never been proven that he committed any crime. 
Yet magistrates continue to haul him into court. 
In France, Paris magistrates attempted for years to indict former President Jacques Chirac on charges of corruption. 
So long as Chirac was president, there was no legal way to pursue him. 
But, with Chirac retired and nearly 80, one “independent” judge has reopened the case. 
Chirac is alleged to have employed municipal civil servants when he was the mayor of Paris, 20 years ago, as aides in his electoral campaign. 
Let us remember that no judge ever indicted François Mitterrand, Chirac’s socialist predecessor, for using government funds to entertain his mistress and illegitimate daughter. 
As further proof of the politicized nature of some French magistrates, immediately after former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was cleared of charges that he had tried to smear President Nicolas Sarkozy, the prosecuting magistrate announced that he would appeal the court’s ruling and prosecute de Villepin again. 
In Buenos Aires, one wonders about the motives of the Supreme Court, which has forbidden President Kristina Kirchner from changing the chairman of the central bank. 
Kirchner is not above suspicion, but the judges’ lack of a watertight legal case raises suspicions of a political motive. 
The situation is more byzantine, but just as politicized, in Turkey, where prosecutors and judges have consistently set their sights on the moderately Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the name of protecting the secular constitution. 
After the AKP was elected in 2003, the Supreme Court dissolved it in order to prevent Recep Tayyip Erdogan from becoming Prime Minister. 
The AKP had to change its name and, for a time, Erdogan had to foreswear the premiership. 
In 2008, prosecutors again tried to have the AKP dissolved, on charges that it was undermining the constitution. 
In 2009, the Supreme Court dissolved the main legal Kurdish party, the DST, accused of being connected with the Kurdish guerillas. 
This arbitrary decision deprived millions of Kurds from any legal representation and disrupted the AKP government’s attempt to reconcile the Kurds with the Turkish Republic. 
Of course, not all judges and prosecutors engage in nakedly partisan activities. 
European prosecutors tend to lean to the left, whereas their Latin American and Japanese counterparts tend to be conservative and pro-establishment. 
Perhaps the most famous investigating magistrate of all, Spain’s Baltasar Garzon, is usually portrayed as waging a borderless crusade for justice. 
His targets, however, almost invariably come from the political right. 
But rather than pursuing such an open ideological agenda, most activist magistrates tend to act as a corporation: their motives can be politicized, but their professional, guild interests come first. 
Famously in France’s Ancien Régime, the judges collectively acted as a close-knit, self-contained social class. 
The French Revolution and the introduction of universal suffrage were aimed as much at ridding France of the corporation of judges as they were at getting rid of the nobility. 
But, despite democratization, judges and prosecutors everywhere have tended to resurrect themselves as a self-appointed elite, insulated by society’s desire that justice be seen as independent. 
When one looks closely at the careers of judges in the above-mentioned countries, the law can vary, but cooptation is the usual rule of the game: a successful judge or prosecutor, in order to climb the professional ladder, must follow the guidance of his peers and increase the influence of his corporation. 
One should also consider why anyone wants to become a judge. 
Aspiring judicial candidates usually want to “clean up” society. 
It is revealing that in Italy, in the 1980’s, the judges who battled the Sicilian mafia described their campaign as “clean hands.” 
In that case, the label fit. 
More often, however, the cleansing is a pretext to change political direction after the people have voted in a way that magistrates oppose. 
Democracy is supposedly based on a separation and balance of institutional power. 
That equilibrium works so long as each institution is submitted to close scrutiny – which judges and magistrates have simply avoided. 
I see no reason to trust judges and prosecutors more than presidents and legislators. 
The Trial of Pavel S. 
STRASBOURG – On a cold winter day in 2004, a young Russian named Pavel Shtukaturov discovered that a judge had stripped him of the right to speak for himself. 
Deprived of legal capacity, he was prohibited from acting independently, or at all, in most areas of life. 
He was no longer able to work, travel, choose his place of residence, buy or sell property, or even marry. 
The judge took away these rights without even informing him – indeed, Pavel only found out a year later. 
When he sought a lawyer to defend his rights, his mother, who had been made his legal guardian, had him locked up in a psychiatric hospital for seven months. 
This Kafkaesque turn of events was possible because Pavel has mental health issues in a system that refuses to protect his rights. 
In Russia, roughly 125,000 people with mental disabilities are confined to institutions – for life. 
There are another 165,000 beds in psychiatric hospitals, with some 650,000 hospitalizations per year. 
But these statistics don’t tell the real story. 
Only rarely do stories like Shtukaturov’s get out. 
It is astonishing how little is known about the treatment of people with mental health problems in Russia. 
There are no independent inspectorates monitoring these hospitals to protect patients’ rights, and there are no advocacy services on behalf of people with mental disabilities. 
Moreover, the minds of many hospital directors are as firmly closed as the institutions themselves. 
So Shtukaturov’s victory before the European Court of Human Rights on March 27 provides hope that a turning point has been reached. 
Back in 2004, when Shtukaturov by chance discovered the judge’s decision, he Googled his way to the only lawyer in Russia who deals with mental health and human rights. 
The lawyer agreed to represent him. 
But when he was subsequently detained in a psychiatric hospital, the Russian government refused to allow the lawyer access to his client. 
Appeals in the Russian courts failed, and he filed a case with the ECHR in March 2006. 
The court found that Pavel’s ordeal violated several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which Russia is a signatory. 
This is the first case in which the ECHR has dealt seriously with the deprivation of legal capacity – which often facilitates abuses instead of protecting people from them. 
According to the court, depriving someone of legal capacity constitutes a “very serious” interference of a person’s right to private life. 
In Russia, the only legal option in these cases is “total guardianship,” which is applied indefinitely and cannot be challenged by the adult in question. 
The court ruled that total guardianship was a “disproportionate” response in Shtukaturov’s case, and its judgment recognized the importance of supplying tailor-made alternatives for people who require temporary or long-term care. 
Russian lawmakers should follow the lead of the ECHR decision and work to create in Russian law and practice alternative mechanisms such as advance directives, powers of attorney, and supported decision-making. 
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – a new human rights treaty that Russia helped draft, but has not yet signed – mandates these alternatives, and represents an opportunity for Russia to undertake crucial human rights reforms on this issue. 
Shtukaturov’s story is unique only because he was able to find his way to a lawyer. 
The ECHR has now cleared a path for the tens of thousands of other people in Russia who suffer abuse at the hands of the very mental health system that is supposed to help them. 
On taking office, Russia’s new president, Dmitry Medvedev, should order an independent review process to help end the country’s pattern of stigmatizing and discriminating against people with disabilities. 
The Tricks of Trade Treaties 
The recent trade agreement between Chile and the United States is being praised as the first significant agreement in the Western hemisphere since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed a decade ago. 
But while it is celebrated in certain American circles, it displays many of the problems that characterize past trade agreements, problems that generate much discontent about globalization. 
Indeed, in some ways it is a step backwards. 
One source of discontent with globalization is that it deprives countries of their freedom to protect their economy and citizens. 
Special interests in industrial countries, it seems, take precedence over broader interests. 
Moreover, these trade agreements are often asymmetric--the North insists on the South opening markets and eliminating subsidies, while it maintains trade barriers and subsidizes its own farmers. 
In some ways, the agreement with Chile broke new ground--in the wrong direction. 
It failed to take advantage of opportunities afforded by more open trade with an emerging market that has a sophisticated and highly qualified public service. 
Particularly ironic was the provision designed to restrict Chile's use of capital controls for short-term speculative capital flows. 
Chile used these measures efficiently and effectively during the first part of the 1990s. 
Research suggests that these restrictions did not affect the flow of long-term capital. 
On the contrary, they probably encouraged inward flows, as funds that otherwise might have been provided on a short-term basis were induced to remain for longer. 
During this period of restrictions on capital flows, Chile grew rapidly, by 7% per year on average. 
More importantly, capital restrictions meant that when Latin America was sent into recession and depression later in the decade, as speculative capital fled most Latin American countries, Chile was largely spared. 
(Of course, it still suffered the consequences of the downturn in copper prices--capital controls can't solve all problems). 
Today, Chile imposes no barriers to the inflow of capital. 
Why, then, be concerned that the new trade agreement restricts what Chile is not doing? 
Indeed, the problem today is not excessive capital inflows; international markets have largely turned against emerging markets. 
So restricting capital inflows is not necessary now. 
In the future, however, that may change. 
Much evidence, meanwhile, suggests that such flows present risk without reward: they lead to increased instability, not increased growth. 
Moreover, countries with heavy short-term indebtedness risk their political autonomy. 
If a leader that is not to Wall Street's liking emerges, markets may raise interest rates to exorbitant levels, threatening to bankrupt the country unless a people choose a leader more to the financial community's liking. 
The recent scare in Brazil before President Lula's election is a good example of this. 
The new treaty between America and Chile also represented an opportunity. 
Free-trade agreements do not ensure free trade. 
This is because the US uses many other protectionist measures to block foreign goods. 
After NAFTA was signed, America took actions to restrict tomatoes, avocados, corn brooms, and truck transportation. 
Chile now faces similar actions, as it has in the past, concerning some important exports, such as wine and salmon. 
Should Chile find other products that can compete against American producers, these too will likely face restrictions. 
The underlying US government philosophy is that American producers are better than those of any country. 
Therefore, if a country out-competes American firms, it must be because it engaged in some unfair practice. 
But this line of reasoning flies in the face of basic economic theory and common sense, which hold that trade is based on each country exporting goods that reflect its relative (or comparative) advantage. 
Too many Americans believe that while trade is good, imports are bad! 
A true free-trade agreement would begin with the premise that it makes no difference where a good is produced: an unfair trade practice is unfair, whether the producer is an American or Chilean. 
Over the years, America has developed a well formulated body of law to determine what is an unfair trade practice inside the US; for instance, what is predatory pricing and how to decide whether it has occurred. 
This law is based on economic principles. 
While imperfect, it is far better than the so-called "fair trade" laws that apply to international trade, but are nothing more than blatant protectionism. 
If those laws were applied within America, most companies would be found to be engaged in unfair trade practices. 
The idea is not merely academic: Australia and New Zealand, in their free-trade agreement, did something along these lines. 
The reason that it was not done in the case of the US and Chile is also clear: protectionist interests in America have little interest in an agreement embodying true free and fair trade. 
(While Chile might, in principal, undertake similar protectionist measures against the US, there is a complete asymmetry in power. 
American dumping duties on Chilean salmon could devastate that industry; 
Chile could take no action against a US industry that would have more than a miniscule impact on American firms.) 
So those who celebrate the new US/Chile trade agreement should be cautious. 
It may inhibit Chile's ability to protect itself against the vagaries of capital markets, and it may not lead to either truly free or fair trade. 
The Triumph of the Powerless 
NEW YORK – It was early June 1989. 
Václav Havel had been released from jail only days before, yet he was full of what now seems an almost prophetic certainty. 
Thousands of his countrymen had written letters petitioning for his release, at a time when declaring solidarity with Czechoslovakia’s most famous dissident was a clear and dangerous act of civil disobedience. 
“We Czechs are finally finding our courage,” he said, as if sensing the people’s new readiness to confront the guardians of their communist police state. “Sooner or later, they will make a mistake, perhaps by beating up some people. 
Then 40,000 people will fill Wenceslas Square!” 
Four months later, one week after people power brought down the Berlin Wall, revolution came to Prague. 
Students organized a small rally in the old Vyšehradcemetery, the burial grounds of Smetana and Dvořák in a fortress overlooking the city. 
As they marched toward Wenceslas Square, bearing candles, riot police cut them off, and many – men, women, children—were brutally beaten. 
Those who fell were kicked and clubbed where they lay. 
The night of November 17 – “Black Friday,” as it quickly came to be known – set Czechoslovakia alight. 
The next day, thousands of Czechs turned out in the streets. 
As Havel had foreseen, his job (and that of the small circle of dissidents surrounding him) would then be to fan that spark, stoke the fire – and guide it. 
Twenty years later, we can only marvel at how brilliantly they performed. 
Prague was 1989’s happiest revolution, a delirium of good feelings. 
The “Velvet Revolution,” as Havel dubbed it, was sheer theater, a geopolitical spectacular that unfolded in vignettes, scenes, and acts, with cameo appearances by famous faces from the past, including Alexander Dubcek and Joan Baez. 
Dissidents just released from jail and eminent emigres suddenly returned home. 
The theme music was the Velvet Underground. 
The stage was the Magic Lantern, the underground theater that served as Havel’s headquarters. 
The backdrop was Prague, impossibly beautiful, impossibly romantic, the city of a hundred spires, tawny ochre houses and churches, shifting late afternoon light, moonlight on the Vltava. 
The audience, of course, was the world. 
We watched it happen on TV. 
We saw the people, assembled in Wenceslas Square, hundreds of thousands of them, jingling their keys and ringing hand-bells in their good-humored farewell to communism: “Your time is up.” 
It was so pure, so clean. It was the climax of the story, the Year of the Fall, a turning point in history: cliché transmuted into Truth. 
We knew our heroes would win. 
Everyone swept up by it felt young again, as though the world had suddenly, mysteriously, euphorically been made new. 
Disney could not have worked a more seductive transformation. 
Here were our children, taking to the streets. 
Here were our children, bloodied and beaten. 
Here were our children, finally, victorious. 
It helped that this revolution could be counted in days, a miracle of compression. 
Once confronted, the Communists almost ran from power. 
An organizer of the November 17 rally told me that he knew it was over that very day, when he expected several hundred people and 20,000 showed up. 
If so, the dénouement came on December 29, the day Vaclav Havel became a free Czechoslovakia’s new president. 
For me, the decisive moment was on Day 11. 
Half a million people had gathered in Prague’s Letná Park to hear Havel speak. 
To this day, I can hardly remember it without tears. 
As Havel finished, a light snow began to fall and, as if on cue, his listeners took their places. 
One by one, in single-file, hand in hand, they began to march toward Wenceslas Square, more than a mile and a half away, following a rickety horse-drawn cart bedecked with the wings of angels. 
It was so very gentle, so strong and irresistible. 
Slowly, the procession wound its way along paths through Letná’s woods, now covered in white. 
Slowly, it snaked down the medieval streets behind Prague Castle and into the square in front of the president's palace. 
There were no chants, no cheers, no hints of confrontation. 
Just the unbroken line of people, holding hands and passing silently in the white darkness, the line looping back and forth outside the forbidding gates. 
From the castle, the line wound down the steep hills of Malá Strana, past the great Baroque cathedral, its ornate spires lighted in the snowy night, down Mostecká Street with its cafes and restaurants, across the shimmering Vltava at Charles Bridge, with its 400-year-old statues of Czech kings and religious saviors, through the narrow streets of the Old Town and finally into Wenceslas Square, where I watched three policemen join the procession, their caps set at jaunty angles, dancing along in tall black leather boots. 
Still the procession came, weaving through the snow, everyone swinging their arms, skipping, happy, joyous. 
The first of the marchers had reached the Square. The last still waited patiently in the park. 
Hand in hand, they bisected the city. 
Hand in hand, they drew a line. 
Here, on one side, stood the people, on the other their oppressors. 
This was the moment. 
Everyone had to choose. 
From high above the city, I looked out at these people dancing through the streets. 
Prague lay away in the distance, lighted and luminous in the snow. 
Never in my life have I seen anything so beautiful. 
I doubt I ever will again. 
The Triumphant Return of John Maynard Keynes 
NEW YORK – We are all Keynesians now. 
Even the right in the United States has joined the Keynesian camp with unbridled enthusiasm and on a scale that at one time would have been truly unimaginable. 
For those of us who claimed some connection to the Keynesian tradition, this is a moment of triumph, after having been left in the wilderness, almost shunned, for more than three decades. 
At one level, what is happening now is a triumph of reason and evidence over ideology and interests. 
Economic theory had long explained why unfettered markets were not self-correcting, why regulation was needed, why there was an important role for government to play in the economy. 
But many, especially people working in the financial markets, pushed a type of “market fundamentalism.” 
The misguided policies that resulted – pushed by, among others, some members of US President-elect Barack Obama’s economic team – had earlier inflicted enormous costs on developing countries. 
The moment of enlightenment came only when those policies also began inflicting costs on the US and other advanced industrial countries. 
Keynes argued not only that markets are not self-correcting, but that in a severe downturn, monetary policy was likely to be ineffective. 
Fiscal policy was required. 
But not all fiscal policies are equivalent. 
In America today, with an overhang of household debt and high uncertainty, tax cuts are likely to be ineffective (as they were in Japan in the 1990’s). 
Much, if not most, of last February’s US tax cut went into savings. 
With the huge debt left behind by the Bush administration, the US should be especially motivated to get the largest possible stimulation from each dollar spent. 
The legacy of underinvestment in technology and infrastructure, especially of the green kind, and the growing divide between the rich and the poor, requires congruence between short-run spending and a long-term vision. 
That necessitates restructuring both tax and expenditure programs. 
Lowering taxes on the poor and raising unemployment benefits while simultaneously increasing taxes on the rich can stimulate the economy, reduce the deficit, and reduce inequality. 
Cutting expenditures on the Iraq war and increasing expenditures on education can simultaneously increase output in the short and long run and reduce the deficit. 
Keynes was worried about a liquidity trap – the inability of monetary authorities to induce an increase in the supply of credit in order to raise the level of economic activity. 
US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has tried hard to avoid having the blame fall on the Fed for deepening this downturn in the way that it is blamed for the Great Depression, famously associated with a contraction of the money supply and the collapse of banks. 
And yet one should read history and theory carefully: preserving financial institutions is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. 
It is the flow of credit that is important, and the reason that the failure of banks during the Great Depression was important is that they were involved in determining creditworthiness; they were the repositories of information necessary for the maintenance of the flow of credit. 
But America’s financial system has changed dramatically since the 1930’s. 
Many of America’s big banks moved out of the “lending” business and into the “moving business.” 
They focused on buying assets, repackaging them, and selling them, while establishing a record of incompetence in assessing risk and screening for creditworthiness. 
Hundreds of billions have been spent to preserve these dysfunctional institutions. 
Nothing has been done even to address their perverse incentive structures, which encourage short-sighted behavior and excessive risk taking. 
With private rewards so markedly different from social returns, it is no surprise that the pursuit of self-interest (greed) led to such socially destructive consequences. 
Not even the interests of their own shareholders have been served well. 
Meanwhile, too little is being done to help banks that actually do what banks are supposed to do – lend money and assess creditworthiness. 
The Federal government has assumed trillions of dollars of liabilities and risks. 
In rescuing the financial system, no less than in fiscal policy, we need to worry about the “bang for the buck.” 
Otherwise, the deficit – which has doubled in eight years – will soar even more. 
In September, there was talk that the government would get back its money, with interest. 
As the bailout has ballooned, it is increasingly clear that this was merely another example of financial markets mis appraising risk – just as they have done consistently in recent years. 
The terms of the Bernanke-Paulson bailouts were disadvantageous to taxpayers, and yet remarkably, despite their size, have done little to rekindle lending. 
The neo-liberal push for deregulation served some interests well. 
Financial markets did well through capital market liberalization. 
Enabling America to sell its risky financial products and engage in speculation all over the world may have served its firms well, even if they imposed large costs on others. 
Today, the risk is that the new Keynesian doctrines will be used and abused to serve some of the same interests. 
Have those who pushed deregulation ten years ago learned their lesson? 
Or will they simply push for cosmetic reforms – the minimum required to justify the mega-trillion dollar bailouts? 
Has there been a change of heart, or only a change in strategy? 
After all, in today’s context, the pursuit of Keynesian policies looks even more profitable than the pursuit of market fundamentalism! 
Bo Xilai Between the Dragon and His Wrath 
LONDON – After a year of unexplained delay, the trial of Bo Xilai, the former Communist Party secretary of Chongqing municipality, is finally about to begin. 
Bo faces three charges: corruption, bribery, and abuse of power. 
But his real offense is that he challenged the Chinese Communist Party’s way of doing things. 
Moreover, his wife’s conviction of the widely publicized murder of British businessman Neil Heywood has severely embarrassed the CCP. 
When the court finally convicts Bo – and he is certain to be convicted – he will probably face a prison term similar to that of former Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Liangyu, who received 18 years, or former Beijing Party Secretary Chen Xitong, who was sentenced to 16 years. 
Like Bo, both men had been members of the CCP Central Committee, the Party’s inner circle – a status that allowed them to escape a death sentence (unlike the lower-ranking former Minister of Railways Liu Zhijun following his conviction on similar charges of corruption and abuse of power). 
For the Party, however, Bo’s conviction will not mark the end of the scandal. 
Nor will the shadow cast over the CCP by his high-living, exiled son Bo Guagua and his homicidal wife Bogu Kailai simply disappear. 
But the fall of Bo and his family hardly rises to the level of Shakespearean tragedy. 
King Lear this is not. 
Of course, Bo and his wife and son have been morally dead for some time. 
Power sapped their humanity. 
Bogu killed Heywood, her lover and business partner, and many other innocent people died as a result of Bo’s ambition. 
His thuggish chief henchman, the former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, fearing that his life was in jeopardy because he knew too much about Heywood’s murder and Bo’s other crimes. 
Still, the CCP wants nothing more than to whitewash the scandal. 
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has already scrapped charges of illicit sexual relations involving several women, signaling that such crimes are to remain hidden when Central Committee members commit them. 
This follows a similar official response to Chen Liangyu’s philandering and to Chen Xitong’s “Five Golden Flowers.” 
Furthermore, charges that Bo received ¥20 million ($3.2 million) in bribes and misappropriated ¥5 million are trivial compared to those leveled against Liu Zhijun. 
Thus, with his level of bribery deemed small, and his wife artfully scapegoated, the only high crime of which Bo stands accused is dereliction of duty. 
By limiting the charges, the CCP has limited the possible punishments. 
As always where the Party is concerned, Chinese law is mere window dressing. 
The law is applied sparingly, if at all, to the Party elite, and the interests of justice (at least as the outside world understands the term) are rarely the highest priority in such situations. 
A trial such as Bo’s is invariably part of a political deal among insiders. 
The real story of Bo’s career – one of infidelity, betrayal, and corruption – is appalling. 
The victims include the Heywood family, his Chinese wife, and their children. 
Their tragedy stands as a profound indictment of the CCP’s rule, because no family is safe when governments are not subject to the rule of law. 
Happy households and harmonious states go together. 
But, in China, party leaders like Bo hold life-or-death power over citizens and their families. 
For the CCP, saving face is paramount. 
Bo will join a long line of incarcerated officials, though the special prisons where they are held may seem like recreation centers for retired senior officials when compared to the abusive and physically degrading conditions that the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo and other prisoners have had to endure. 
Bo’s son, Bo Guagua, will live an invisible life abroad. 
So Bo is anything but a tragic figure. 
When he cries for his dead daughter Cordelia, King Lear comes to understand the personal flaws that brought about his demise, and for this he elicits sympathy. 
When Bo appears in court, his pleas will not be so persuasive. 
We may see in his face Lear’s desperation: “Howl, howl, howl, howl! 
But in the courtroom, and all over China, the audience will remain unmoved – and rightly so. 
The Trouble with Eurobonds 
MUNICH – German Chancellor Angela Merkel has withstood the pressure from southern Europe: there will be no Eurobonds. 
For the markets, this is a disappointment, but there is no other way for these countries to rebuild themselves than to insist patiently on a phase of debt discipline and an end to lax budget constraints. 
Investors in Europe’s troubled economies are already getting enough as it is. 
Eurozone leaders’ decision on July 21 to allow the European Financial Stability Facility to buy back old debts – limited only by the EFSF’s capacity – already amounts to a type of Eurobond. 
And the European Central Bank will also blithely continue its bailout policy in terms of giving loans to the eurozone’s troubled members and purchasing their government bonds. 
Southern Europe, however, is pushing hard for a complete changeover to Eurobonds to get rid of the interest-rate premiums relative to Germany that markets are demanding of them. 
This is understandable, given that the hope of interest-rate convergence was a decisive reason for these countries to join the euro in the first place. 
And, for a little more than a decade, from 1997-2007, this hope was realized. 
For the Italian state, interest-rate convergence brought a medium-term reduction in debt-service payments of up to 6% of GDP. 
That would have been sufficient to pay back the entire Italian national debt over about a decade and a half. 
Italy, however, chose to squander that interest-rate advantage. 
Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio today, at 120%, is as high as it was when the country entered the eurozone in the mid-1990’s. 
Now that interest-rate spreads are increasing again, the pain is considerable, prompting calls for Eurobonds. 
When other countries guarantee repayment, it is hoped, low interest rates will return. 
But who is to make these guarantees? 
The debt-to-GDP ratios of France and Germany are well above 80%, which isn’t all that far below Italy’s – and far above Spain’s. 
Pooling debts doesn’t make them go away. 
Everybody and every country must service their own debts; there is no way around that. 
And, incidentally, the current agitation about interest rates is a bit over the top. 
The interest rates that countries like Italy and Spain have to pay today are only half as high as they were in 1995, before the conversion rates within the eurozone were set; likewise, interest-rate spreads vis-à-vis Germany today are only two-thirds of their size then. 
There is no indication that the markets are dysfunctional and overstating the differences between countries’ creditworthiness. 
The spreads are necessary to keep capital flows within the eurozone in check. 
Before the introduction of the euro, capital flows had been limited by uncertainty about exchange rates. 
This saved Europe from overly large external imbalances. 
Now, without exchange-rate risk, interest-rate spreads based on debtor countries’ credit ratings are the only remaining defense against excessive capital movements and the resulting external imbalances. 
If investors are given unlimited protection, with no risk of bearing their share of possible losses, capital will continue to flow unimpeded from one corner of the eurozone to the other, prolonging these imbalances. 
For many years, Italy has disregarded the debt ceilings imposed by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Only when interest rates recently began to rise a bit did the government finally – and promptly – implement an austerity program, with the approval of all political parties. 
The markets, not political debt ceilings, are taken seriously; the introduction of Eurobonds would remove that disciplining function. 
To a limited extent, the same applies to the EU bailouts and ECB interventions. 
These could be justified during the recession of 2008-2009, but now they have become counter-productive, because they undermine the markets’ controlling function. 
By replacing the private credit that is being withdrawn with public credit, the external imbalances within the eurozone are being perpetuated. 
Even today, four years into the crisis, there are no signs that the overly expensive countries in Europe’s southern periphery have begun devaluation in real terms by cutting wages and prices. 
That, however, is a precondition for reducing external imbalances and reliance on foreign credit. 
The bailouts are prolonging the crisis because they amount to an attempt to keep asset prices at a level above the market equilibrium, creating a unilateral downward risk that is limited only by the deep pockets of the relief funds. 
This is reminiscent of central banks’ futile efforts, back when fixed exchange-rate regimes were common, to stabilize rates above their market equilibrium. 
The result, much like today, was merely to exacerbate market turbulence. 
It is time for Europe to face reality and initiate the difficult adjustment processes within the real economy that are necessary to rebalance the eurozone. 
Eurobonds would numb the distressed countries’ current pain, but, by failing to treat the underlying disease, they – and the eurozone as a whole – would end up far sicker than before. 
The Trouble with European Defense 
WASHINGTON, D.C.: The Nice summit of EU leaders achieved few of its aims, but it did push the creation of a military identity for the EU, the European Defense Initiative (EDI), forward. 
That movement, however, is beginning to arouse worries, both in NATO and in the United States. 
It has long been a bedrock principle of American foreign policy to endorse any move to further integrate the European Union. 
If specific US interests might be harmed by such moves, the remedy is to seek revisions in detail, without opposing the overall initiative. 
Unlike the British Tories, some French Gaullists, and many Danes and Swedes, Americans do not fear the prospect of a United States of Europe, a potential competitor to be sure, but also a much-needed partner on the world scene. 
When EDI first emerged, America’s response was no different. 
Although some outspoken French proponents of EDI made no secret of their desire to replace NATO altogether, this being seen by them as the only way of emancipating Europe from American hegemony, that is not how EDI was officially presented and discussed in the councils of the European Union. 
That official EDI was to be an auxiliary to NATO not a competitor, its purpose to provide European forces for less demanding peace-keeping operations that did not require the participation of American combat forces. 
American diplomacy, therefore, did nothing to oppose EDI, and even welcomed the possibility that it might induce Europe’s political elites to support more military spending, reducing the burden on the US. 
The seemingly endless Bosnia peacekeeping force is a case in point. 
If EDI would supply additional troops to allow the US Army to withdraw its 4,600 soldiers, that would suit America very well because there are many other demands on US forces around the world, 
Yet in the final weeks of the Clinton Administration America’s attitude to EDI changed. 
In his last visit to NATO, Secretary of Defense William Cohen replaced polite approval in principle with expressions of concern that stop just short of outright opposition. 
The reason is simple: money. 
Instead of adding resources to European security, it now seems that EDI will reduce them. 
Measured in constant 1999 US dollars (before the distorting effect of the fall of the Euro), all the member states of the EU are now spending some $156 billion combined on defense, very much less than in the final Cold War year of 1985 when that total came to $216 billion. 
Having long since collected the peace dividend, the main protagonists of EDI are still reducing their defense spending: between 1998 and 1999, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom reduced their combined defense expenditure by a further $10 billion dollars. 
In other words, there is no extra money to pay for EDI, but there are all sorts of extra requirements. 
Most obvious is the new European General Staff now being formed in Belgium, whose work will inevitably duplicate what NATO already does, while adding yet another military bureaucracy, with its administrative support, extra pay and allowances for service abroad, mass of documents in two languages and more. 
That expenditure might not be very large, but it adds to the high proportion of European military spending already consumed by each country’s defense ministry, separate headquarters for each service, and plethora of supporting bureaucracies. 
These, indeed, remain almost as large as in 1985, when the number of people in uniform, aircraft, warships, armor and artillery was almost twice as large as today. 
Far greater, however, is the invisible cost: the 60,000 troops assigned to EDI are already organized for joint action under NATO command. 
If only because very few French officers have served in NATO commands, the joint staff work learned in almost half-a-century of NATO experience will have to be re-learned. 
What is urgently needed in Europe is less bureaucratic overhead and more trained troops. 
Except for the British and very small elite units elsewhere, most European troops are not trained well enough for combat, or even for peacekeeping in dangerous places. 
That became obvious in Kosovo, where the soldiers and officers sent by most countries were incapable of elementary infantry missions such as night patrols in small teams, which were essential to controlling depredations by the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army’s fighters. 
But EDI will provide no additional troops and no added combat training – joint exercises are mostly ritualistic – while requiring yet more spending on bureaucracy. 
For America, this means that the European forces of NATO will actually be weakened by EDI, adding to the potential burden on US combat forces. 
That is not something even the most polite US diplomat can welcome. 
The Trouble with Hope 
PARIS – America’s presidential election campaign is being followed in Europe with passionate interest. 
It is seen as a long saga full of surprises. 
The human and intellectual qualities of the three remaining candidates are even viewed with some envy on this side of the Atlantic, where you can hear statements such as: “Could we borrow just one of your candidates?” 
But Europeans’ interest in this presidential election cannot mask the fact that what they expect from it is far from clear. 
Europeans may want a more “normal” America, closer to their own values, but they simultaneously worry that a more modest America would demand more of them in the realm of “hard” military power. 
America as a model or America as a protector – this “European dilemma” is in itself new. 
For, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, most Europeans viewed the United States as both its defender against the Soviet Union’s expansionist aims and the key external actor for their deeply wounded continent’s moral and economic reconstruction. 
This is no longer the case. 
The collapse of the USSR, America’s self-inflicted wounds – particularly in Iraq – and the spectacular rise of Asia have changed European perceptions of the US. 
America is no longer the protector or model that it used to be, nor is it alone in terms of influence and power. 
One can even say that the European Union has slowly become a “normative” force in the world in reaction to the evolution of America’s power. 
Europe has long known that it could never balance America in the realm of “hard power”; but, with the decline of America’s “soft power,” it became more important than ever to incarnate the “humane” and law-abiding face of the West. 
In this sense, Europe has come to see itself, at least in part, as an alternative dream for everyone who had stopped dreaming about America. 
But, seen from within, the EU model often appears less convincing. 
Thus, many Europeans continue to be nostalgic for America as a model. 
For these Europeans, Barack Obama, campaigning under the banner of “hope,” is the ideal choice to restore, as if by magic, America’s soft power. 
After all, he himself incarnates the American Dream. 
But some Europeans prefer Hillary Clinton or even John McCain, because they are apprehensive about the consequences for America’s European partners of a more restrained and less experienced president. 
They worry about not only competence, but also the old transatlantic issue of “burden sharing.” 
The implicit question behind some European reservations about Obama may be formulated in one question: “Will we have to do more in Afghanistan and beyond?” 
Could the restoration of America’s international reputation turn out to be bad for Europe, by eroding its new monopoly on representing Western values and calling it back to its hard power duties? 
Could it be that a candidate of fear – McCain or, increasingly, Clinton – really serves Europe’s interests better than a candidate of hope? 
With Obama in power, it would become – at least initially – more difficult for Europeans to denounce America, even if the “New France” of Nicolas Sarkozy has already moved away from this easy temptation. 
But it would also be less easy to reject a call for greater burden sharing in the world. 
This “defensive” view of transatlantic relations is problematic. 
The best America for Europe and the world is a confident America – an America that sheds its culture of fear and rediscovers the roots of its culture of hope. 
This is Obama’s America. 
Of course, the greater your expectations are, the greater the risk of disappointment. 
But, after eight years of America’s self-imposed isolation under Bush, it is a risk worth taking. 
Even if America is no longer the world’s only superpower, it still remains the “indispensable nation.” 
So Europeans are right to be fascinated by America’s presidential election. 
Regardless of who wins, the consequences of the outcome will reverberate throughout the world. 
The Trouble with Japanese Nationalism 
Barely half a year into his premiership, Japan’s Shinzo Abe is provoking anger across Asia and mixed feelings in his country’s key ally, the United States. 
But will the Bush administration use its influence to nudge Abe away from inflammatory behavior? 
Abe’s predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, was a mold-breaking leader, reviving Japan’s economy, reforming the postal savings system, and smashing the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s faction system. 
But Koizumi also legitimized a new Japanese nationalism, antagonizing China and South Korea by his annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. 
If anything, Abe is even more committed to building an assertive and unapologetic Japan. 
Anyone who believes that the Yasukuni controversy is an obscure historical matter that Chinese and Koreans use to badger Japan for political advantage has probably never spent much time there. 
The problem is not the 12 Class-A war criminals interred at the shrine; the real problem is the Yushukan military museum next door. 
Walking past the Mitsubishi Zero, tanks, and machine guns on display in the museum, one finds a history of the Pacific War that restores “the Truth of Modern Japanese History.” 
It follows the nationalist narrative: Japan, a victim of the European colonial powers, sought only to protect the rest of Asia from them. 
Japan’s colonial occupation of Korea, for example, is described as a “partnership”; one looks in vain for any account of the victims of Japanese militarism in Nanjing or Manila. 
One might be able to defend the museum as one viewpoint among many in a pluralist democracy. 
But there is no other museum in Japan that gives an alternative view of Japan’s twentieth-century history. 
Successive Japanese governments have hidden behind the Yushukan museum’s operation by a private religious organization to deny responsibility for the views expressed there. 
That is an unconvincing stance. 
In fact, unlike Germany, Japan has never come to terms with its own responsibility for the Pacific War. 
Although socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama officially apologized to China in 1995 for the war, Japan has never had a genuine internal debate over its degree of responsibility, and has never made a determined effort to propagate an alternative account to that of Yushukan. 
My exposure to the Japanese right came in the early 1990’s, when I was on a couple of panels in Japan with Watanabe Soichi, who was selected by my Japanese publisher (unbeknownst to me) to translate my book The End of History and the Last Man into Japanese. 
Watanabe, a professor at Sophia University, was a collaborator of Shintaro Ishihara, the nationalist politician who wrote The Japan That Can Say No and is now the governor of Tokyo. 
In the course of a couple of encounters, I heard him explain in front of large public audiences how the people of Manchuria had tears in their eyes when the occupying Kwantung Army left China, so grateful were they to Japan. 
According to Watanabe, the Pacific War boiled down to race, as the US was determined to keep a non-white people down. 
Watanabe is thus the equivalent of a Holocaust denier, but, unlike his German counterparts, he easily draws large and sympathetic audiences. 
(I am regularly sent books by Japanese writers that “explain” how the Nanjing Massacre was a big fraud.) 
Moreover, there have been several disturbing recent incidents in which physical intimidation has been used by nationalists against critics of Koizumi’s Yasukuni visits, such as the firebombing of former prime ministerial candidate Kato Koichi’s home. 
(On the other hand, the publisher of the normally conservative Yomiuri Shimbun attacked Koizumi’s Yasukuni visits and published a fascinating series of articles on responsibility for the war.) 
This leaves the US in a difficult position. 
A number of American strategists are eager to ring China with a NATO-like defensive barrier, building outward from the US-Japan Security Treaty. 
Since the final days of the Cold War, the US has been pushing Japan to rearm, and has officially supported a proposed revision of Article 9 of the postwar constitution, which bans Japan from having a military or waging war. 
But America should be careful about what it wishes for. 
The legitimacy of the entire American military position in the Far East is built around the US exercising Japan’s sovereign function of self-defense. 
Japan’s unilateral revision of Article 9, viewed against the backdrop of its new nationalism, would isolate Japan from virtually the whole of Asia. 
Revising Article 9 has long been part of Abe’s agenda, but whether he pushes ahead with it will depend in large part on the kind of advice he gets from close friends in the US. 
President Bush was unwilling to say anything about Japan’s new nationalism to his “good friend Junichiro” out of gratitude for Japanese support in Iraq. 
Now that Japan has withdrawn its small contingent of troops, perhaps Bush will speak plainly to Abe. 
The Trouble with Libertarian Paternalism 
CHICAGO – There are many arguments against government paternalism: apart from limiting individual choice (for example, the choice to remain uninsured in the current health-care debate in the United States) and preventing individuals from learning, history suggests time and again that the conventional wisdom prevalent in society is wrong. 
And, since governments typically try to enforce the conventional wisdom, the consequences could be disastrous, because they are magnified by the state’s coordinating – and coercive – power. 
A clear example is financial regulation, which in many ways is a form of paternalism. 
In the US, the low risk assigned to senior tranches of mortgage-backed securities made them attractive instruments for banks to hold, given the relatively high return they offered. 
But they proved far from safe, despite the prior conventional wisdom. 
And, because the regulator had pronounced them safe, far too many banks overloaded on them, rendering them even more risky when the banks tried to sell them at the same time. 
Other examples of the danger of the coordinating power of government paternalism abound. 
As I drive to downtown Chicago, I pass a series of high-rise housing projects, meant in their time to be the miracle cure for homelessness, poverty, unemployment, and crime. 
Today, they are seen as the best way to concentrate and perpetuate many of those ills. 
Not only were the housing projects kept a safe distance from areas that had good jobs, but, with few residents experiencing stable families and livelihoods, there were not enough local examples of success to guide young people. 
As a result, many went astray. 
The fashion today is to integrate poor households into flourishing communities. 
No doubt we will discover some unintended consequences in the future, and the power of government coordination will ensure that those consequences are widespread. 
But some amount of paternalism is necessary in civilized societies. 
Social security is a paternalistic form of forced savings for old age, preventing individuals from consuming and saving as they please. 
It exists, in part, because individuals know that civilized societies will never stand by and watch the elderly starve. 
So individuals are forced to save in order to prevent them from gaming the system – not saving when young, knowing that they will be assured a minimum level of support by a humane society when old. 
Similarly, the mandated purchase of insurance in the Obama administration’s health-care bill is an attempt to prevent the young and the healthy from remaining uninsured and turning to the government for support only when they discover that they need it. 
So, if paternalism has benefits as well as costs, how do we get the former without the latter? 
My colleague, Richard Thaler, along with Cass Sunstein, who currently serves in the Obama administration, wrote a best-selling book, Nudge, in which they suggest a way to reduce our uneasiness with paternalism. 
Essentially, by exploiting behavioral quirks, they would nudge people into making decisions that are good for them, even while individuals have complete freedom to change their mind. 
So libertarian paternalism, in their view, eliminates one of the main objections to paternalism – that it constrains individual choice. 
For example, in deciding how their pension savings will be allocated, most people simply choose the default option in their employer-offered plan. 
Often, the default option is unsuitable for most individuals – for instance, it typically allocates all savings to low-return money-market funds. 
Sunstein and Thaler would have the employer choose a default option that works for most people, such as 60% in equities, 30% in bonds, and 10% in money-market funds. 
That is the paternalistic part. 
The libertarian part is that the employee has the right to opt out of the default option. 
Because people rarely move away from the default option, the employer’s paternalistic choice prevails, and we get libertarian paternalism. 
What is not to like? 
The problem is that the semblance of choice in libertarian paternalism is an illusion. 
Choice remains unexercised, because individuals do not consciously think through their decision. 
If their choices can be directed, is this not paternalism plain and simple, rendered more sinister because individuals are unaware that they are being nudged, and cannot raise their guard? 
One response is to point out that most plans already have a default option that determines savings allocations. 
Sunstein and Thaler merely say that the default option should be set in a way that is good for people, and clearly they have an idea of what is good. 
This, then, is the nub of the problem. In choosing the default option, the government or the employer nudges all employees into prevailing fads such as “buy equity for the long run.” 
This, they believe, is better than the current typical default option of putting individuals’ money into money-market funds. 
But it may be worse: coordinating everyone into risky asset investments may be more dangerous than coordinating them into boring investments like money-market funds. 
Could there be a better alternative? 
What if there were no default option, and individuals were sent repeated, and increasingly urgent, reminders to choose an allocation if they did not choose one already. 
The conventional wisdom could be offered as a recommendation, along with explanations of why it makes sense, but it would not be the default. 
This would force people to exercise choice. 
Some people would differ from the conventional wisdom, benefiting the system by introducing some variety and resilience. 
More generally, the flaw in some forms of libertarian paternalism is that the free choice that it appears to offer leaves the paternalism largely unconstrained. 
Would it not be far better to force conscious choice in order to limit the consequences of paternalistic mistakes? 
The Trouble with Poland 
“We are only demanding one thing, that we get back what was taken from us….If Poland had not had to live through the years 1939-1945, it would be a country of 66 million.” 
Thus spoke Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski on the eve of the last European Union summit, when he sought to gain greater voting weight for his country within the EU by invoking the memory of Hitler’s war against Poland. 
Kaczynski’s words, however, stand in contradiction with what happened in Paris this July 14th. 
For on Bastille Day, a small Polish contingent marched down the Champs de Elysée alongside the forces of 26 other EU national contingents, including the Germans, in a display of European unity. 
This contrast perfectly summarizes today’s confused Poland – a country that boasts one of the highest levels of popular acceptance of the EU among all member countries, yet is the place where defense of the “national” interests is practiced most fiercely. 
Poland today is no longer “God’s Playground,” to use Norman Davies’s famous phrase. 
Instead, it seems more like a child’s playground: a strange mixture of inferiority and superiority complexes. 
The problem is that Poland’s unjustified lack of confidence is leading to an extremely unpleasant form of intolerance toward others. 
To understand what went wrong with Poland, a comparison with Spain might be useful. 
In the nineteenth century, Europe’s southern and eastern extremities were united by common decay. 
Poland had disappeared as an independent nation, the victim of its powerful neighbors’ greed; 
Spain was a country that no longer mattered. 
This dual decline was a subject frequently discussed by historians across the continent. 
They generally emphasized the failure of both countries to adjust their political systems to the requirements of the times. 
Today, Spain and Poland both appear to be experiencing a renaissance, thanks to the framework of European unity. 
Their economies are booming. 
Democracy has been restored after half-century of dictatorial disruption. 
Yet the buoyant self-confidence of today’s Spain is completely absent from Poland. 
Is this because Poland’s sufferings were even more terrible than Spain’s? 
Is it because it is more difficult to emerge from a totalitarian regime than from an authoritarian one? 
Is it because Spain has had 20 more years to be vaccinated by the EU against the temptations of nationalism? 
All these explanations probably contain an element of truth. 
And perhaps there is another factor: there is more pride and less self-doubt in Spanish culture than in the Polish one. 
What seems clear is that Poland today can choose among two paths. 
It can continue to play a “nuisance value” role in the Union. 
But in that case, it must at least play well. 
Poland’s government cannot simultaneously pretend to resist Russia’s energy pressures and yet reject Germany’s offers of help. 
When all things are considered, Germany is a more reliable ally and partner than Ukraine, which some in Warsaw see as a potential counterweight to Russia. 
The realities of the present must not be obscured by the burdens of the past. 
Entering the EU means integrating into a country’s politics a logic dominated by the concept of reconciliation. 
In this sense, Germany, having stifled the evils of aggressive nationalism, remains the most “European” country in Europe. 
To deny this, to threaten to undo Polish-German reconciliation, is to harm Poland’s fundamental national interests. 
By antagonizing Germany, indeed all of the EU, Poland is merely encouraging a revisionist Russia. 
If Poland’s current leaders want to re-play nineteenth-century balance-of-power games, they should understand where the real weight of power in Europe lies. 
The other path Poland can take is that of Spain. 
Javier Solana, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, symbolizes the role that Spaniards are playing in building Europe’s international identity. 
Spain’s influence is, to a large extent, a result of its national self-confidence. 
Demographically and strategically, Poland is by far the most important of the EU’s new members. 
Former French President Jacques Chirac, with his seeming contempt for these new members, is gone. 
Nobody is out to insult the Polish people gratuitously. 
Only the Poles can harm Poland’s reputation and influence, and one must say that they have excelled at it of late. 
In the course of the last five years, while teaching at the College of Europe in Natolin, near Warsaw, I have witnessed at first hand Poland’s remarkable progress. 
Sadly, there is a “disconnect” between Poland’s economic progress and the discourse and behavior of its politicians. 
Warsaw exudes positive energy. 
The famous Polish plumber is a guarantee of high-quality work across Europe. 
Everywhere from London to Rome to Paris, Polish artisans are contributing decisively to the beautification of Europe, using the skills they used in the past to build cities like Krakow and St. Petersburg. 
The problem is in the eyes of the beholder. 
If Poland were less unjustifiably afraid of its future, it would be less obsessed with a past that will not pass away. 
One hopes that this is just a temporary phase, and that comprehension of Poland’s real achievements will prevail over the hyper-sensitivity of its current leaders. 
For the “real Poland” that emerged after 1989 is much more promising than their political incarnation of it. 
The Trouble with Treating Trauma 
When disaster strikes, the arrival of ``trained counselors'' is as much a part of the theater of disaster as the arrival of the emergency services. 
What do these counselors actually do? 
Usually, they perform some form of what is called ``debriefing'' or ``critical incident stress debriefing.'' 
But do these sessions do any good? 
Debriefing is invariably a short, usually single session, an intervention that is performed with as many of those caught up in a traumatic event as possible. 
It involves linking examination of the traumatic incident with education about the expected emotional responses and assurances that these are normal. 
The hope is to reduce acute emotional distress and prevent the onset of post-trauma psychiatric disorder. 
Many organizations offer debriefing as part of their response to traumatic incidents - such as police officers involved in firearm incidents, or bank staff who witness robberies. 
In some institutions interventions are compulsory - perhaps out of a desire to reduce psychological distress, but also from a belief this will reduce exposure to litigation. 
There are many reasons why belief in the effectiveness of debriefing has become so widespread. 
When facing disasters, all of us feel a need to do something. 
The idea that talking about trauma must be better than ``repressing'' or ``bottling up'' accords with a long tradition in psychological treatment - ``better out than in.'' 
Many people who have been debriefed judge the experience positively. 
But does it work? 
There is only one way to really know if any intervention does more good than harm, and that is via randomized controlled trials. 
The studies undertaken so far provide no evidence of any benefit through intervention. 
Perhaps the process of debriefing, part of whose purpose is to warn participants of emotional reactions that might be expected to develop over weeks and months, actually increases the occurrence of these symptoms. 
Perhaps for some people not talking is the most appropriate response. 
Indeed, psychological defense mechanisms may exist precisely because it is not always ``better out than in.'' 
Talking to a stranger, whom one has never met before and will not meet again, may impede the normal processes of recovery that rely on one's own social networks - family, friends, priest, doctor, who may be better able to place the trauma in context. 
Perhaps debriefing serves merely to professionalize distress - part of the wider process nowadays by which adversity has been professionalized. 
Of course, when a cherished belief is challenged, various counter claims arise - the evidence is for the wrong type of debriefing, the trials were not well done, elements of debriefing could still ``work,'' the testimonies of those who are certain it helped them cannot be discounted, and so on. 
This is inevitable, but it should not distract us from the main findings. 
So we must reassess how we respond to trauma. 
There can be no doubt that those who are attempting to help people involved in disasters and trauma have noble motives, but that is not enough. 
It is time that those who are asked to take part in debriefing are warned that the process has the capacity to do harm as well as good. 
Compulsory debriefing, which is still used in some organizations, must cease forthwith. 
But should we be skeptical of all ``talking treatments?'' 
Unlike debriefing, there is overwhelming evidence that some talking treatments, such as cognitive therapy or cognitive behavior therapy, is effective when applied to disorders such as depression, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
What is the difference then between these talking therapies and the vogue for debriefing? 
Two things. 
First, unlike debriefing these interventions work not on normal people who have been exposed to adversity, but on those who have a definite psychiatric disorder. 
Second, these are skilled interventions, delivered by practitioners with well defined and well regulated professional skills, who are either clinical psychologists or psychiatrists. 
They are also given over a period of time. 
Sadly in mental health, effective treatments are neither swift nor easily learnt. 
There is also a final paradox. 
When disaster strikes, it is the experience of all health professionals that they are often overwhelmed with offers of help. 
After the shootings at Columbine high school in the US a few years ago, the school received over 3,000 offers from people willing to come and ``debrief'' the children. 
But it is the mundane, non-newsworthy traumas of life that cause real harm. 
The old people shattered by a burglary. 
The wife driven to depression by her husband's infidelity. 
The bank manager who cannot get to work because of panic attacks. 
Or the teenager disabled by obsessive compulsive disorder. 
For them finding skilled psychological therapies and therapists is rarely easy, even though in all of these instances the evidence of effectiveness is beyond dispute. 
So we should take a long, hard look at how we manage our resources. 
It seems better to concentrate on delivering effective treatments to the smaller number of people who really need them, and not on the larger number of people who don't. 
The story of debriefing provides a salutary lesson. 
First, people are more resilient than we give them credit for. 
Second, no matter how well meaning our attempts to reduce distress and prevent psychiatric disorder, and no matter how self-evident the intervention, we still require firm proof of the benefits. 
Any health care intervention has the capacity to do harm as well as good, and occasionally the balance between the two will surprise us. 
The True Costs of the Iraq War 
The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless. 
But that doesn’t mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be subjected to cool, hard economic analysis. 
Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $100 and $200 billion, other officials quickly demurred. 
For example, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $60 billion. 
It now appears that Lindsey’s numbers were a gross underestimate. 
Concerned that the Bush administration might be misleading everyone about the Iraq war’s costs, just as it had about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and connection with Al Qaida, I teamed up with Linda Bilmes, a budget expert at Harvard, to examine the issue. 
Even we, as opponents of the war, were staggered by what we found, with conservative to moderate estimates ranging from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than $2 trillion. 
Our analysis starts with the $500 billion that the Congressional Budget Office openly talks about, which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the war would cost. 
Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government. 
And the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole. 
For example, the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded – 16,000 so far, including roughly 20% with serious brain and head injuries. 
So it is no surprise that its figure of $500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come. 
Nor does the administration want to face up to the military’s recruiting and retention problems. 
The result is large re-enlistment bonuses, improved benefits, and higher recruiting costs – up 20% just from 2003 to 2005. 
Moreover, the war is extremely wearing on equipment, some of which will have to be replaced. 
These budgetary costs (exclusive of interest) amount to $652 billion in our conservative estimate and $799 billion in our moderate estimate. 
Arguably, since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes, the expenditures have been debt financed, and the interest costs on this debt add another $98 billion (conservative) to $385 billion (moderate) to the budgetary costs. 
Of course, the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families. 
But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings. 
Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million). 
But the costs don’t stop there. 
The Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy, with one spokesperson even suggesting that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices. 
As in so many other ways, things have turned out differently: the oil companies are the big winners, while the American and global economies are losers. 
Being extremely conservative, we estimate the overall effect on the economy if only $5 or $10 of the increase is attributed to the war. 
At the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere. 
We estimate that if a proportion of that money had been allocated to domestic investment in roads, schools, and research, the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short run, and its growth would have been enhanced in the long run. 
There are a number of other costs, some potentially quite large, although quantifying them is problematic. 
For instance, Americans pay some $300 billion annually for the “option value” of military preparedness – being able to fight wherever needed. 
That Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs. 
But there is little doubt that the option value has been greatly impaired and will likely remain so for several years. 
In short, even our “moderate” estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America’s involvement in Iraq. 
And our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself. 
We do not attempt to explain whether the American people were deliberately misled regarding the war’s costs, or whether the Bush administration’s gross underestimate should be attributed to incompetence, as it vehemently argues is true in the case of weapons of mass destruction. 
Nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war. 
Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs. 
Certainly, when a war’s timing is a matter of choice, as in this case, inadequate preparation is even less justifiable. 
But such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration’s reckoning. 
Elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century. 
The Iraq war was an immense “project,” yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent. 
One cannot help but wonder: were there alternative ways of spending a fraction of the war’s $1-$2 trillion in costs that would have better strengthened security, boosted prosperity, and promoted democracy? 
The Truth About Climate Change 
EXETER – Many people ask how sure we are about the science of climate change. 
The most definitive examination of the scientific evidence is to be found in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its last major report published in 2007. 
I had the privilege of being chairman or co-chairman of the Panel’s scientific assessments from 1988 to 2002. 
Many hundreds of scientists from different countries were involved as contributors and reviewers for these reports, which are probably the most comprehensive and thorough international assessments on any scientific subject ever carried out. 
In June 1995, just before the G-8 summit in Scotland, the Academies of Science of the world’s 11 largest economies (the G-8 plus India, China, and Brazil) issued a statement endorsing the IPCC’s conclusions and urging world governments to take urgent action to address climate change. 
The world’s top scientists could not have spoken more strongly. 
Unfortunately, strong vested interests have spent millions of dollars on spreading misinformation about climate change. 
First, they tried to deny the existence of any scientific evidence for global warming. 
More recently, they have largely accepted the fact of anthropogenic (man-made) climate change but argue that its impacts will not be great, that we can “wait and see,” and that in any case we can always fix the problem if it turns out to be substantial. 
The scientific evidence does not support such arguments. 
Urgent action is needed both to adapt to the climate change that is inevitable and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, to prevent further damage as far as possible. 
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the world’s nations signed up to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), the objective of which is “to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that does not cause dangerous interference with the climate system…, that allows ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, that ensures food production is not threatened, and that enables economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.” Such stabilization would also eventually stop further climate change. 
It is now recognized that widespread damage due, for instance, to sea level rise and more frequent and intense heat waves, floods and droughts, will occur even for small increases of global average temperature. 
Therefore it is necessary that very strong efforts be made to hold the average global temperature rise below 2º Celsius relative to its preindustrial level. 
If we are to have a good chance of achieving that target, the concentration of CO2 must not be allowed to exceed 450 parts per million (it is now nearly 390 ppm). 
This implies that before 2050 global emissions of CO2 must be reduced to below 50% of the 1990 level (they are currently 15% above that level), and that average emissions in developed countries must be reduced by at least 80% of the 1990 level. 
The United Kingdom has already committed itself to a binding target to reduce emissions by that amount, and President Barack Obama has expressed intention that the United States should also set that target. 
One clear requirement is that tropical deforestation, which is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, be halted within the next decade or two. 
Regarding emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its “Energy Technology Perspectives” has set out in detail the technologies and actions that are needed in different countries and sectors to meet these targets. 
For the short term, the IEA points out that very strong and determined action will be necessary to ensure that global CO2 emissions stop rising (the current increase is more than 3% per year), reach a peak by about 2015, and then decline steadily toward the 2050 target. 
The IEA also points out that the targets can be achieved without unacceptable economic damage. 
In fact, the IEA lists many benefits that will be realized if its recommendations are followed. 
What is required now is recognition that anthropogenic climate change will severely affect our children, grandchildren, the world’s ecosystems, and the world’s poorer communities, and that the severity of the impact can be substantially alleviated by taking action now. 
The Truth about NATO Burden-Sharing 
BRUSSELS – When discussing Afghanistan, many newspapers continue to suggest that some of Europe’s NATO allies are under-performing in Afghanistan, and are either unable or unwilling to make a greater effort. 
Naturally, these allies feel that their efforts are under-valued. 
What is a fair and equitable burden? 
First of all, the debate about burden-sharing should not be reduced solely to today’s force levels in Afghanistan, because, however important these force levels are, they tell only part of the story. 
So let me broaden the debate and offer a more holistic perspective by covering three interconnected elements: defense transformation, operations, and the wider context of the international community’s efforts. 
Defense transformation is a key aspect of burden-sharing. 
It is a golden rule within the alliance that the bulk of NATO’s forces and capabilities are owned by individual nations – the alliance’s fleet of Airborne Warning and Command System (AWACS) aircraft is a rare exception. 
As I don’t expect nations to abandon this principle, NATO will continue to depend on individual allies and their willingness to commit resources. 
Contrary to popular opinion, the type of forces and capabilities needed by NATO are not as widely available in national inventories as one might think. 
Large proportions of NATO allies’ armed forces are still better suited for static territorial defense than for the expeditionary type of operation needed in Afghanistan. 
And, when the right type of forces and capabilities do exist, operations led by the United Nations, the European Union, or ad hoc coalitions, as well as national requirements, place additional demands on these assets. 
Developing the necessary expeditionary capabilities is a major feature of NATO’s transformation process. 
But it is not possible to convert territorial forces into expeditionary forces overnight, and the costs of transformation often must compete with the costs of deploying forces for operations. 
Many allies face the dilemma of either spending money on operations or investing in new acquisition programs. 
Moreover, many allies’ failure to respect the 2%-of-GDP target for their defense budgets exacerbates this dilemma, and also widens the capability gap with those allies that are investing in usable and deployable forces. 
But, while there is no substitute for appropriate defense budgets, we could get more from current spending levels, especially through a smarter approach to defense acquisition. 
Unfortunately, despite the efforts of NATO and the EU, Europe’s defense sector remains fragmented, which leads to duplication, unhelpful competition from too many rival systems, and, significant capability gaps or incompatibilities. 
In Afghanistan, for example, national systems for friendly-force tracking, which are vital to preventing accidental attacks on one’s own forces or allies, are not compatible. 
Extra time and money has therefore had to be invested in the acquisition of these capabilities. 
In Europe, many national defense budgets can no longer sustain both fully-fledged national forces and a national defense industry. 
Only smarter multinational and transatlantic cooperation will give us forces that are capable of dealing with today’s security challenges. 
In an alliance founded on the principle of “all for one, and one for all,” it is vital that all nations are seen to contribute fairly to operations. 
Thus, NATO, developed a burden-sharing mechanism to assess members’ manning commitments for critical operational activities relative to their gross national income. 
This sort of arithmetic has the merit of giving some indications about burden-sharing, but it has also been shown that burden-sharing cannot be fully captured in graphs and spreadsheets. 
How does one decide what is a fair contribution from a country of 50 million people compared to a country with only four million? 
How can you evaluate a contribution of light infantry against the provision of critical enablers such as helicopters or air-to-air refueling tankers? 
Over what time period do you make your calculations? 
Common funding, with all members paying a share according to their GDP, is one instrument that can be used to achieve more equitable burden-sharing. 
Traditionally, NATO applied a policy of “costs lie where they fall”: each member picked up all the costs for the operational contribution that it made to an Alliance operation. 
During the past couple of years, NATO’s funding policy has been updated to allow common funding to be used as an incentive for the provision of certain theater-level enabling capabilities, like medical facilities, airports handling troops and supplies, or intelligence. 
Burden-sharing is a sensitive issue, for both NATO and the international community, and passions sometimes run high. 
By stepping back and looking at the broader picture, it is clear that it is not just a matter of having the right capabilities, but also of having the money and political will to deploy them. 
No single measure can resolve the burden-sharing problem. 
But the range of initiatives now underway within NATO should help: transformation efforts to increase the pool of usable and deployable forces; wider use of multinational initiatives; greater reliance on common funding to assist force generation; and a comprehensive approach for sharing burdens more equitably across the entire international community. 
An alliance like NATO, in contrast to many “coalitions of the willing,” has the political consultation structures, proven planning mechanisms, effective command and control, and legitimacy that encourages nations to contribute to an operation. 
Alliance solidarity is not just a slogan. 
The sense of keeping one’s obligations and commitments to other allies, upon whom one’s own security ultimately depends, is a powerful motive for equitable burden-sharing. 
Totally fair burden-sharing may not be possible, but a security organization like NATO undoubtedly allows us to come closer to it than any other approach. 
The Truth about Negotiations 
ATHENS – When people and countries negotiate, they often talk about their interests as though they were the only matters that could elicit agreement. 
In casting his veto at the European Union’s December summit in Brussels, British Prime Minister David Cameron said, “What is on offer isn’t in Britain’s interests, so I didn’t agree to it,” as if agreement solely depended upon whether or not interests were satisfied. 
Then again, reaching an agreement might never have been Cameron’s goal. 
While so-called “win-win” outcomes are increasingly considered to be the ultimate purpose of every negotiation, what if the negotiating parties contemplate a win-win outcome that actually harms non-participants to the talks, or is against the law? 
What if the outcome is beneficial but contrary to the principles of the negotiating parties? 
Imagine that you are at a negotiating table and want the other party to agree with you. 
A strategy that could work would be to stress how the outcome is beneficial to everyone involved. 
But the outcome you propose might not be fair, or realistic, or you might be consciously lying. So, although based on interests, such a proposal will not be easily accepted. 
Indeed, when one ponders how many issues there are to consider, it becomes obvious that negotiation is a type of communication that involves far more than interests. 
Principles, morality, and simple respect for the truth guide agreement as much as interests do. 
Some would argue that successful negotiators require only tact – the ability to use principles to conceal one’s true interests. 
If this were correct, the United States was right to wage war on Iraq on the basis of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s regime. 
But it is now widely accepted that the way in which the US negotiated its way into war was a mistake – one that has cost it enormous credibility as a negotiating partner. 
In fact, the US often stands for high principles, such as freedom and democracy, and incorporates them successfully into its foreign policy. 
Defending economic aid to Europe after World War II, General George C. Marshall, then US Secretary of State, gave an inspirational speech that argued that US policy is not directed against “any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.” The Marshall Plan was as much about principles as it was about protecting US interests. 
Even if the Cameron government’s rhetoric seems to be focused on “interests,” its negotiating positions also reflect higher principles, just as other countries’ do. 
The United Nations and other organizations bear witness to countries’ commitment to principles of justice and solidarity, and to their willingness to set aside their narrow agendas to serve higher causes. Negotiation should address these causes no less than it speaks to interests. 
None of this is to deny that interests do, after all, play a role in negotiations, or that interests can affect morality. 
Immanuel Kant famously argued otherwise – that morality should be free of non-universal interests. 
But the contemporary philosopher Jürgen Habermas argues that moral norms are valid as long as people accept them freely after having considered the consequences of their implementation for the satisfaction of interests. 
Of course, consideration of interests means just that: they must be taken into account; they do not have to be entirely satisfied. 
In some cases, the defense of interests alone might seem appropriate – for example, in certain business transactions. 
The more complicated a negotiation, though, the more difficult it is to disregard complex issues such as values and norms or the importance of being sincere. 
As Aristotle said: “that which is true and better is naturally always easier to prove and more likely to persuade.” 
If negotiations truly need proper argumentation of this sort, it surely makes sense that many differences are resolved outside the context of negotiations. 
Likewise, certain “negotiations” are not negotiations at all, but are better understood as processes of extortion and blackmail. 
In today’s globalized world, true negotiation is necessary. 
Countries and peoples form an interconnected web of interests that cannot be easily disentangled and satisfied in an isolated manner. 
Resolving disputes requires mutually accepted principles that guide how individuals and countries interact. 
Negotiation is the path toward successful conflict resolution, but it should be conducted according to basic rules of true and open communication. 
Countries and peoples should stop debating the interests that often divide them and start discussing the principles that unite them. 
As long as communication is conducted truthfully and with respect to values, norms, and objective facts, negotiations will be able to achieve consensus and agreement. 
The Truth About the Yugoslav Truth Commission 
When dictatorships fall, how can societies heal the wounds? 
Truth commissions are increasingly seen as the way forward. 
But when do they work best and what structures and rules make them work most effectively? 
When are they a means to unearth the truth and restore social peace and when are they merely a clever way for politicians to avoid responsibility and a reckoning with the past? 
Serbia is a test case for all of these issues. 
In one respect, the body appointed by President Vojislav Kostunica to examine the crimes of Yugoslavia’s recent past is like South Africa’s successful model: it is called a "Truth and Reconciliation Commission." 
The resemblance ends there. 
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by legislation after careful consideration by parliament and extensive discussion across the country. 
Fourteen months elapsed between the time Justice Minister Dullah Omar announced the government's intention to establish a commission and its signature into law by President Nelson Mandela. 
The mandate and the operating procedures of the Commission were clearly spelled out. A timetable for the Commission to report was specified. 
Measures were incorporated to ensure that the Commission would obtain the testimony of perpetrators as well as victims. 
Though the South African Cabinet decided that the hearings at which perpetrators would disclose their crimes should be closed, Parliament amended this to require that they should do so in public. 
Funds were appropriated for the Commission's operations. After the law was signed President Mandela appointed a committee to assist him in identifying those who should serve. 
299 names were submitted. The committee held public hearings and selected 25 to forward to President Mandela. 
He chose 17, appointing Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a man widely acknowledged as South Africa's moral conscience, to chair the Commission. 
The contrast in Yugoslavia is stark. 
Yugoslavia’s Commission was appointed by President Kostunica with only the vaguest of mandates, and with no procedures, no budget, no timetable, and no Chairman. 
Parliament was not involved. The Yugoslav President acted on his own. 
The Commission's appointment has been little noted in the Yugoslav press. 
Kostunica's off-hand way of creating the Commission signaled to the public that this is not serious. 
The recent resignations of two of the Commission’s most respected members exposed the body’s fundamental flaws. 
It brought into question whether a commission lacking the authority to secure testimony from victims can make any progress towards a real understanding of the crimes committed, and the roots of the wars, in neighboring Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo. 
The resignations also showed that prominent Serbs have their own doubts about President Kostunica’s ill-conceived approach. 
A real truth commission could play a useful role in Yugoslavia. 
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague has publicly indicted Slobodan Milosevic and a small number of other Serbs for crimes committed on a large scale. 
Like it or not, President Kostunica will probably not escape his obligation to turn them over for trial. 
He should not be misled by the certification granted to Yugoslavia by President Bush following the arrest of Milosevic on corruption charges. 
Indeed, international and domestic support for the Hague Tribunal are increasing and Milosevic, General Ratko Mladic and other indictees now sheltered by the Yugoslav government will have to face charges for the horrendous crimes committed under their leadership in the wars they started over the past decade. 
Yet a broader-ranging inquiry by a well-conceived truth commission could do much to supplement criminal trials in helping their fellow Serbs to confront their own political responsibility for those crimes. 
It is not self-evident how a Yugoslav truth commission should operate. 
Its most difficult task will be to obtain the testimony of the victims. 
Why would Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Kosovar Albanians go to Yugoslavia to talk about the crimes committed against them by the military and paramilitary forces controlled by Belgrade? 
What incentives could be provided to induce them to testify? 
Could the Commission obtain their testimony outside Yugoslavia? 
If it cannot obtain the testimony of the victims, what other means could be used to document the crimes that it should consider? 
Truth commissions in a few Latin American countries played a valuable role even though they were not able to obtain testimony from perpetrators but there is no precedent for a commission performing usefully without hearing from the victims. 
In mid-May, a public conference on truth commissions will be held in Belgrade under the sponsorship of Radio B-92, a Belgrade station that distinguished itself by its outspokenness during the Milosevic years and continues in its independent ways. 
Some of those who played key roles in the South African Commission and in truth commissions from all over the world will attend that conference. 
President Kostunica is also slated to participate. 
He would be well advised to shelve the commission he appointed as a false start, listen to the participants in B-92's conference and then start again. 
The Tsunami Effect 
The extraordinary international response to the tsunamis that devastated South Asia is a remarkable political phenomenon. 
Though it is too soon to predict all the effects, some good consequences are already evident, as are some that are troublesome and others whose impact will play out over time. 
One useful consequence is that wealthy countries’ low levels of assistance to those less fortunate has gained wider attention. 
Plainly, the comment by Jan Egeland, the United Nations official in charge of humanitarian assistance, calling the West “stingy,” hit home, especially in the United States. 
At that point, the Bush administration had committed a measly $35 million in aid. 
While condemning Egeland’s comment, Bush quickly multiplied America’s commitment ten-fold. 
In addition, he enlisted former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a private fundraising effort. 
This neatly fit a standard response to criticism of the level of American assistance: that private philanthropy exceeds government aid. 
Depending on what monies are included, this is true, although the British, Dutch, Germans, French, and other Europeans are also generous donors, despite lacking the tax benefits that encourage private philanthropy in the US. 
Moreover, like official US assistance, a relatively small share of American private philanthropy ordinarily goes to the poorest countries. 
In contrast, the countries that are most generous – Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and tiny Luxemburg – give proportionately far more than American governmental and private assistance combined, and the lion’s share of their aid goes to the world’s most impoverished countries. 
In the wake of the tsunamis, it seems possible that the US and other wealthy countries will rethink their assistance programs and, possibly, step up their aid to those most in need. 
Perhaps even some oil-rich governments will be embarrassed by attention to their miserliness in doling out assistance. 
But there is also a risk that assistance for tsunami victims is diverting aid from disasters that are of a more chronic character or that are less amenable to sensational media coverage. 
In announcing that it would stop accepting donations for the victims of the tsunami after collecting €40 million for that purpose, Médecins Sans Frontières noted its urgent need for funds for such man-made catastrophes as Darfur in Sudan and for the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
In recent years, many more people have died in the conflicts in Sudan and Congo than were killed by the tsunamis. 
Some were direct victims of the fighting in those countries, while a much larger number died from war-related hunger and disease. 
Similarly, the number of those forcibly displaced is a multiple of those who lost their homes and livelihoods due to the tsunamis. 
Yet MSF was able to collect only €650,000 in two months of soliciting funds for Darfur, while it received €40 million for the tsunami victims in just eight days. 
Given the limited number of skilled personnel available to humanitarian agencies, human resources could follow the money. 
Another question likely to loom large in coming months is whether assistance is politicized and free of corruption. 
Politicization is important because the two countries that were hardest hit, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, both suffer armed conflicts in tsunami-hit regions. 
Aceh province in Indonesia was previously largely closed to outsiders. 
It was ruled by the Indonesian army, which fought a brutal civil war against the separatist Free Aceh Movement. 
Similarly, northern Sri Lanka is the main battleground for the long-running conflict between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 
Despite headway towards settling that struggle, violence continues and could erupt again in full fury. 
Germany, where combined public and private aid for tsunami victims has reached $1.1 billion (making it the largest international donor), says that it would like its aid to be used to foster peace settlements. 
A worthy goal, but successful models do not come readily to mind. 
More common is a situation like that of ex-Yugoslavia. 
During the wars in Croatia and Bosnia the UN was responsible for humanitarian assistance and also dedicated to peacemaking. 
Yet it was never able to use the former to advance the latter. 
It would not be the first time that a government misused aid intended for disaster victims. 
A notorious example is Nicaragua after the earthquake that leveled the capital, Managua, in December 1972. Nicaragua’s dictator, Anastasio Somoza, diverted much of the international assistance meant for the survivors into his own pockets and those of his cronies. 
In the process, he incited popular support for the left-wing Sandinista guerrillas who toppled his government later in the decade. 
The tsunamis provide an opportunity for the UN to reclaim the high ground that it lost recently. 
Battered by the Iraqi “oil for food” scandal, which, at the least, demonstrated mismanagement, and misdeeds by officials ranging from former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers (now High Commissioner for Refugees), who faces allegations of sexual harassment, to rapes committed by UN peacekeeping troops in Congo, the UN has a chance to rehabilitate its reputation by managing the relief effort effectively. 
Doing so requires putting the right person in charge — someone like Paul Hoffman, the American industrialist who managed the Marshall Plan more than half a century ago and, subsequently, headed the UN Development Program. 
It also requires making sure that the person in charge gets the staff assistance and the political backing required to do the job well. 
The Tunisian Catalyst 
DAVOS – The whole world celebrates Tunisia’s democratic revolution, which has set off a cascade of events elsewhere in the region – particularly in Egypt – with untold consequences. 
The eyes of the world are now set on this small country of ten million, to learn the lessons of its recent experience and to see if the young people who overthrew a corrupt autocrat can create a stable, functioning democracy. 
First, the lessons. 
For starters, it is not enough for governments to deliver reasonable growth. 
After all, GDP grew at around 5% annually in Tunisia over the last 20 years, and the country was often cited as boasting one of the better-performing economies, particularly within the region. 
Nor is it enough to follow the dictates of international financial markets – that may get good bond ratings and please international investors, but it does not mean that jobs are being created or that standards of living are being increased for most citizens. 
Indeed, the fallibility of the bond markets and rating agencies was evident in the run up to the 2008 crisis. 
That they now looked with disfavor at Tunisia’s move from authoritarianism to democracy does not redound to their credit – and should never be forgotten. 
Even providing good education may not suffice. 
All over the world, countries are struggling to create enough jobs for new entrants into the labor force. 
High unemployment and pervasive corruption, however, create a combustible combination. 
What matters is a sense of equity and fair play. 
If, in a world of scarce jobs, those with political connections get them, and if, in a world of limited wealth, government officials accumulate masses of money, there will be justifiable outrage at such inequities – and at the perpetrators of these “crimes.” 
Outrage at bankers in the West is a milder version of the same basic demand for economic justice that we saw first in Tunisia, and now across the region. 
Virtuous though democracy is – and as Tunisia has shown, it is far better than the alternative – we should remember the failures of those who claim its mantle, and that there is more to true democracy than periodic elections, even when they are conducted fairly. 
Democracy in the United States, for example, has been accompanied by increasing inequality, so much so that the upper 1% now receives around one-quarter of national income – with wealth being even more inequitably distributed. 
Indeed, most Americans today are worse off than they were a decade ago, with almost all the gains from economic growth going to the very top of the income and wealth distribution. 
And corruption American-style can result in trillion-dollar gifts to pharmaceutical companies, the purchase of elections with massive campaign contributions, and tax cuts for millionaires as medical care for the poor is cut. 
Moreover, in many countries, democracy has been accompanied by civil strife, factionalism, and dysfunctional governments. 
In this regard, Tunisia starts on a positive note: a sense of national cohesion created by the successful overthrow of a widely hated dictator. 
Tunisia must strive to maintain that sense of cohesion, which requires a commitment to transparency, tolerance, and inclusiveness – both politically and economically. 
A sense of fair play requires voice, which can be achieved only through public dialogue. 
Everyone stresses the rule of law, but it matters a great deal what kind of rule of law is established. 
For laws can be used to ensure equality of opportunity and tolerance, or they can be used to maintain inequalities and the power of elites. 
Tunisia may not be able to prevent special interests from capturing its government, but, if public financing of electoral campaigns and restrictions on lobbying and revolving doors between the public and private sectors remain absent, such capture will be not only possible, but certain. 
Commitments to transparent privatization auctions and competitive bidding for procurement reduce the scope for rent-seeking behavior. 
There are many balancing acts to be mastered: a government that is too powerful might violate citizens’ rights, but a government that is too weak would be unable to undertake the collective action needed to create a prosperous and inclusive society – or to prevent powerful private actors from preying on the weak and defenseless. 
Latin America has shown that there are problems with term limits for political officeholders, but not having term limits is even worse. 
So constitutions need to be flexible. 
Enshrining economic-policy fads, as the European Union has done with its central bank’s single-minded focus on inflation, is a mistake. 
But certain rights, both political (freedom of religion, speech, and press) and economic, need to be absolutely guaranteed. 
A good place for Tunisia’s debate to begin is deciding how far beyond the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the country should go in writing its new constitution. 
Tunisia is off to an amazingly good start. 
Its people have acted with purpose and thoughtfulness in setting up an interim government, as Tunisians of talent and achievement have, on a moment’s notice, volunteered to serve their country at this critical juncture. 
It will be the Tunisians themselves who will create the new system, one that may serve as a beacon for what a twenty-first-century democracy might be like. 
The Turkish Chimera 
WASHINGTON – The dramatic revolts in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya have acted as a catalyst for a broader Arab awakening that has fundamentally shaken the Middle East’s political order, which has been in place since the late 1970’s. 
While it is too early to predict the final outcomes, several important regional implications are already beginning to emerge. 
First, the revolts are a double-edged sword for Iran. 
The Iranian regime may benefit from the ouster or weakening of pro-Western Arab leaders and regimes in Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, but Iran’s initial encouragement of the democratic uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt came with a sting in the tail. 
Iranian officials had to shift gears quickly once their own population began to call for the same democratic rights, suggesting that Iran could face stronger pressures for democracy and political change over the medium and long run. 
Second, the upheavals threaten to leave Israel more isolated. 
With Mubarak gone, Israel has lost its most important regional partner. 
Indeed, given the serious deterioration in Israel’s relations with Turkey, Mubarak’s departure has deprived it of its two most demonstrable allies in the region. 
While Egypt’s interim military regime has pledged to adhere to the 1979 peace agreement, a new, more democratic government could adopt a different attitude. 
Third, the pressures for democratic change have significantly bolstered Turkey’s regional influence. 
While the United States and the European Union initially hedged their bets, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan sided squarely with the demonstrations for democracy in Tahrir Square – a move that enhanced Turkey’s prestige among the democratic opposition in Egypt and elsewhere in the region. 
Many Arabs regard the brand of moderate Islam espoused by Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as a possible model for the Middle East. 
Many Turks have begun to see things the same way. 
In a recent interview, Erdoğan noted that Turkey could be a “source of inspiration” for countries in the Middle East, because it has shown that Islam and democracy can coexist harmoniously. 
At first glance, the Turkish model – with its emphasis on secularism and democracy – has obvious appeal in a region burdened by corrupt, autocratic, incompetent, and inefficient governments. 
But Turkey’s historical experience and political evolution differ in important ways from Arab countries’. 
As a result, its model cannot easily be transplanted. 
Turkish Islam is more moderate and pluralistic than elsewhere in the Middle East, and, since at least the late Ottoman period, Turkey has sought to fuse Islam and Westernization. 
This differentiates Turkey from most other Muslim countries in the Middle East, and has enabled it to avoid the sharp dichotomies, ruptures, and violence that have characterized political modernization elsewhere in the region. 
The rise of the AKP’s moderate brand of Islam was largely in response to internal factors, particularly the cumulative effects of several decades of democratization and socioeconomic transformation, which gave rise to a new entrepreneurial class in Anatolia that was economically liberal but socially and politically conservative. 
This class, one of the AKP’s main pillars of electoral support, does not exist elsewhere in the Middle East. 
Moreover, the Turkish model owes much to the leadership of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic. 
Ataturk, a committed Westernizer and political visionary, transformed the multinational Ottoman empire into a modern state based on Turkish nationalism. 
But, in transforming Turkey, Ataturk did not begin entirely from scratch. 
The process of Westernization and modernization had begun in the late nineteenth century under the Ottomans during the period of the Tanzimat. 
While the Kemalists sought a radical break with the Ottoman past, there were important elements of continuity between their Westernization efforts and those undertaken in the late Ottoman period. 
Both were elitist and state-driven. 
These important pre-conditions do not exist in the Arab Middle East. 
Most countries in the region lack strong independent political institutions and traditions on which to build a democratic political order. 
They also lack a vibrant civil society. 
Ultimately, the Arab countries do not have the benefit of Turkey’s tradition of moderate Islam or its history of successfully fusing Islam and Westernization. 
As a result, the collapse of the old power structures in many Middle East countries is likely to be accompanied by considerable political turmoil and violence. 
Taksim and the Left 
ISTANBUL – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center. 
On May 28, a handful of Turkish environmentalists started a peaceful protest against a redevelopment plan for the park that would replace the greenery with a replica of an Ottoman-era army barracks, a shopping mall, and apartments. 
But heavy-handed police repression launched a massive civic movement that has spread to the entire country. 
The redevelopment plan for the park triggered a huge protest against what a large segment of the Turkish public, particularly young people, considers paternalistic and authoritarian political leadership. 
The movement’s rapid growth was fueled by widespread opposition to what many regard as official efforts to regiment lifestyles, as well as by frustration over perceived economic inequities. 
Indeed, though environmentalists and secular youth spearheaded the protest movement, it became remarkably diverse and inclusive almost overnight. 
Pious Muslims – particularly those who believe that Turkey’s urban development has created too much rent-seeking and too many easy fortunes – joined the demonstrations as well, as did some far-left groups. 
Some of the protests became violent. 
Overall, however, the movement has remained peaceful and even joyous. 
Moreover, important figures in or close to the ruling Justice and Development Party expressed their willingness to hold a dialogue with the protesters. 
President Abdullah Gül, in particular, played a calming, statesmanlike role. 
A striking feature of the protests has been the distance that the demonstrators have put between themselves and existing political parties, including the Republican People’s Party (CHP), the largest force in the center-left secular opposition. 
In this sense, the Taksim “sit-in” resembles protests elsewhere, particularly in the advanced democracies, from the “Occupy Wall Street” movement to the protests in Spain and Italy. 
To be sure, there are country-specific features to such protests – including, in Turkey’s case, the reaction against lifestyle paternalism. 
But social democrats must understand why the protests developed quite independently of existing, organized, center-left politics. 
Without such realism, the center left in Europe and the emerging world cannot regain political momentum. 
Modern production systems, in which information technology plays an increasingly crucial role, are totally different from the large factory floors that characterized the birth of trade unionism and social democracy. 
The way much of GDP is now produced has made it significantly harder for the left to organize in traditional ways. 
That has weakened center-left parties. 
Yet information technology and global social media have empowered people to overcome social fragmentation along occupational, residential, and national lines. 
On some recent days, posts about Taksim Square have reportedly occupied a huge part of the entire world’s “Tweet space.” 
In this corner of cyberspace, there is, of course, everything under the sun, including calls for the worst sort of sectarianism. 
Nonetheless, what dominates is a desire for individual freedom, an acceptance of diversity, great concern for the environment, and a refusal to be “organized” from above. 
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the CHP’s reformist leader, quickly recognized these dynamics: “The demonstrators don’t want us on the front lines,” he said, “and we have much to learn from these events.” 
And yet, while civil society can be a trigger, sooner or later democratic politics has to drive the process of change. 
Whether in New York, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Istanbul, or New Delhi, a feeling of unease and a desire for change has emerged in societies that are becoming increasingly unequal, and in which politics and business mix in non-transparent ways. 
Rising youth unemployment and cuts in pensions and social expenditures come at a time when many large multinational corporations legally avoid taxes by shifting their profits to favorable jurisdictions. 
In the eurozone, stock prices are soaring, while joblessness is at a record-high 12.2%. 
The democratic opposition can address the flaws of the existing order only if it recognizes the need for very different forms of mobilization from those of the past. 
It must recognize a strong popular desire for individual autonomy, more leadership positions for women and the young, and greater support for individual enterprise (along with reforms of social insurance that make it cost-effective and truly inclusive). 
Finally, the environment, climate change, and global solidarity will be defining themes of the twenty-first century. 
Acting on their own, nation-states can successfully address neither tax avoidance nor carbon emissions. 
The renewed patriotism seen in many places – a response to the unfairness and dislocation that globalization can generate – must be reconciled with human solidarity, respect for diversity, and the ability to work across national borders. 
The success of Germany’s Green Party reflects the focus that it has placed on many of these issues. 
The events that started in Taksim Square are specific to Turkey, but they mirror aspirations that are universal. 
The same can be said for the challenge facing the democratic left. 
The Twilight of France’s Republican Aristocracy 
PARIS – No tumbrils have appeared in Paris’s Place de la Concorde, but a revolution may be underway in France nonetheless. 
Recent weeks have seen the trial of former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and the conviction of former Defense Minister Charles Pasqua. 
Now even former President Jacques Chirac has learned that he is not immune from prosecution. 
Is France’s “Republican Monarchy,” to borrow a phrase from Jean-François Revel, about to be overthrown? 
The French Revolution never actually ended the privileges of France’s ruling elites. 
True enough, some aristocratic heads rolled, but the nobility eventually returned to France. 
When the Republic replaced the monarchy for good, in 1875, ballots replaced birthright, but the new governing elite believed that it possessed the same rights and perks as the former aristocrats. 
But the concept of the “Republican monarchy,” which is mostly concerned with the mores of French presidents and their entourages, did not really take hold until the Fifth Republic. 
Once elected, the French president and his court gain access to financial privileges that are not always legal. 
Moreover, they live behind a shroud of secrecy: how they use official airplanes, the civil servants they employ for personal service, not to mention the mistresses, has always been more or less considered private territory. 
Journalists avoided commenting on these matters. 
The public either was unaware of any excesses, or deemed the ruling elite corrupt by definition. 
The apex of the aristocratic Republic was reached under the Socialist President François Mitterrand, who ruled from 1981 to 1995. 
Unknown to the public, a government jet would ferry him to Egypt to spend weekends with his mistress and his illegitimate daughter. 
Only the media elite knew, and they never mentioned it. 
Chirac, who succeeded Mitterrand as president, was only slightly more cautious. 
All this has changed. 
In less than a week, Pasqua was sentenced to three years in jail for illegal arms trading with Angola. 
Villepin, a former Prime Minister for Chirac, awaits judgment on charges of having organized a smear campaign against his rival for the presidency, Nicolas Sarkozy. 
Chirac’s indictment is remarkable for the very modesty of his supposed crime: he is suspected of having asked city bureaucrats to work for his political party and run his electoral campaigns when he was mayor of Paris. 
On a lighter note, Sarkozy’s Minister of Culture Frédéric Mitterrand, the nephew of the former president, is being excoriated by the media for supporting Roman Polanski against efforts by the United States to extradite him to face punishment for the rape of a minor three decades ago. 
It turns out that this Mitterrand shared with Polanski a taste for teenagers (of the same sex in Mitterrand’s case). 
So, something of a democratic revolution may be underway in France. 
The ancien regime’s supporters call it a “populist” revolution. 
But it is a revolution made in the courts, not the streets. 
French judges have become more independent than they traditionally were. 
Inspired by Italy’s investigating magistrates who took aim at the mafia bosses, and those Spanish judges who act as social redeemers, some French judges are determined to democratize the French Republic and eradicate corruption. 
The Internet is a seminal lever in this process. 
Today, President Mitterrand’s mistress and daughter could not benefit from the media’s complicity: no state secrets, and no aristocratic excess, can escape today’s bloggers. 
Is the private life of France’s elite also now to be exposed? 
This right to a private life, including extramarital affairs, has always been a sacred cow of French politics. 
The journalists who knew about Mitterrand’s second wife argued that it was a private matter. 
And so it would have been had he not used state funds to provide his other family with lodgings, chauffeurs, and jets for their Egyptian weekends. 
Today, many French journalists still resist the temptation to expose the private lives of the political elite. But this is a lost battle: the bloggers do not share the journalists’ ethics. 
Sarkozy understands the new rules of the game. 
As soon it was known that he had an intimate relationship with a former fashion model, he decided to marry her, avoiding any further embarrassment. 
But aristocratic habits do not die easily, even in Sarkozy’s overexposed regime. 
Sarkozy’s son, Jean, has already been elected to a major local government office at the tender age of 22. 
Being as ambitious as the father, Jean Sarkozy recently tried to have himself appointed as chairman of a powerful public company. 
Bloggers, followed by traditional journalists, went up in arms against such blatant nepotism. 
Young Sarkozy withdrew. 
France, it seems, does not yet share the real democratic culture of, say, Scandinavia. 
French ministers have yet to be seen taking the bus or the subway to their offices. 
French ministries still occupy the former eighteenth-century palaces of the King and his nobility. 
As long as the governing elite works in this splendor, one cannot expect that they will ever behave like common mortals. 
As Bossuet, Louis XIV’s confessor, declared to the Sun King: “You’ll die, but you are immortal.” 
But, like French hauteur in international affairs, the end of an era may be at hand. 
The Twilight of Pervez Musharraf 
It is said that political power in Pakistan flows from the three A’s: Allah, the Army, and support from America. 
Of the three, it is the army leadership that has the clearest means of ridding the country of Pakistan’s president in uniform, Pervez Musharraf. 
And that’s the main reason any power-sharing deal with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is unlikely to end Pakistan’s political turmoil. 
Musharraf hoped to extend his presidency this fall without caving in to opposition demands that he renounce his military position and restore a civilian rival to the post of prime minister. 
But few international leaders face such a wide range of sworn domestic enemies. 
Since seizing power following a 1999 coup, Musharraf has survived at least three serious assassination attempts. 
His anti-terrorist partnership with the United States fatally undermined his political alliance with Pakistan’s religious conservatives even before his government stormed Islamabad’s Red Mosque in July, killing more than 100 people. 
The threat of terrorist attacks inside the country will continue to rise. 
Musharraf also has plenty of secular enemies. 
Their anger, inflamed in March when he tried unsuccessfully to sack the Supreme Court’s independent-minded chief justice, rages on. 
The court recently ruled that Nawaz Sharif, who Musharraf unseated eight years ago, must be allowed to return from exile. 
Sharif is planning a grand entrance. 
His “decisive struggle against dictatorship” – and determined opposition to any deal with Bhutto that excludes him – will intensify. 
Musharraf is warning him to remain in London. 
America isn’t happy with Musharraf, either. 
Some in Washington charge that he has done too little to roust al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters from safe havens along the country’s border with Afghanistan. 
His recent flirtation with a plan to bypass Bhutto and declare emergency rule provoked pointed Bush administration criticism. 
But it’s the army that is most likely to eventually decide the fate of his presidency. 
Musharraf’s rule has given the military leadership a strong role in policymaking, but his eight years in office have badly damaged domestic support for the army’s influence within the government. 
His unpopularity has become their unpopularity. 
Aware of a potential threat from within their ranks, Musharraf has populated his inner circle with relatively junior (and reliably loyal) officers. 
But a deal that makes Bhutto prime minister would undermine the military’s influence – and eventually its support for Musharraf’s presidency. 
As prime minister, she could eventually revisit her deal with Musharraf from a position of strength. 
Military leaders know this, and the threat that they will eventually push him aside will plague his presidency well into next year. 
The army is unlikely to move on Musharraf directly unless subtler methods fail. 
The generals know that another coup would further weaken the military’s popular standing – as well as Pakistan’s relations with the US – at a moment when Bhutto and Sharif have raised expectations at home and abroad for a permanent return to civilian rule. 
But if Musharraf were to refuse to go quietly, the generals could promise him a long list of public corruption charges that he must survive without their protection. 
Musharraf’s presidency won’t survive long without military backing. 
To preserve the appearance that their meddling is benign, senior military officers probably know that they cannot afford to install another general as president. 
Instead, they will most likely support cosmetic political reforms, including a new law that formally separates the roles of army commander and head of state. 
That is the strategy the military adopted in 1988, following the mysterious plane crash that killed former President (and General) Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. 
The army leadership ordered elections, permitted the formation of a civilian government, and then stage-managed the political process from the wings. 
Bhutto, the leader of a secular party that now enjoys substantial support in Washington, would dominate policy planning in the next government at Musharraf’s expense. 
She must build on her domestic support, but she can rely on economic and security cooperation with America to safeguard the country’s stability. 
In addition, the military’s role as guarantor of stability, and its tight control of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, the army’s crown jewels, will continue. 
The Bush administration can therefore enthusiastically back a return to civilian rule and claim a much-needed victory for democracy in a Muslim country. 
But Bhutto would inherit Musharraf’s domestic enemies. 
Sharif would fulminate against her every misstep, threats of attack from religious radicals would continue, and the military would safeguard its interests from just off stage. 
Adding to the pressure, America would expect the kind of cooperation in pacifying Pakistan’s tribal areas that Musharraf has proven unable to provide. 
The military will, under any scenario, continue to quell fears of complete political chaos. 
But it would also likely ensure that a Musharraf-Bhutto deal does not fully close a tumultuous chapter in Pakistan’s history. 
The Two Communities of Europe 
Europe finds itself at a paradoxical turning point. 
While legal harmonization and constitution- making attest to deepening integration, Europe's institutions have failed to generate what every political community needs in order to survive and thrive: a feeling of belonging. 
As long as this is true, integration cannot succeed. 
Quite simply, if the European Union is to overcome national parochialism and embrace a shared and binding purpose, it must abandon the rhetoric of accountants and speak in a language that comprehends what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, right and wrong. 
This won't happen automatically or overnight. 
Communal values and bonds evolve from a long accumulation of experience, with mythological and historical understandings that give this experience the appearance of having evolved organically. 
There is nothing comparable in EU integration, which seems far more like a deliberate choice by an imperial few. 
So it is difficult to see how this path could lead to the collective and individual identity that European unification requires. 
Instead, Europe should draw on two periods of community building. 
Medieval Christianity in its 13th-century formed a community united around a common faith, with Rome as its unifying power center. 
Saint Peter's successors as Roman pontiffs oversaw a network of Church-run universities which educated cultural elites in the same way and in the same language (Latin). 
A network of churches--built in the same style throughout Europe--shared a common calendar and liturgy. 
Medieval Christianity was by nature European, although it avoided the word itself and accepted all national forms of cultural expression. 
The ``Republic of Letters,'' lasting from Erasmus until the Enlightenment, represents Europe's second community. 
As vernacular languages--particularly French--displaced Latin, religious discourse gave way to observation and analysis, with unlimited faith in reason and scientific progress. 
A communications network that allowed rapid dissemination of ideas served a common spirit. 
Intellectual and cultural ties were reinforced by travel, so that statements such as Montesquieu's--that ``Europe is just one nation made up of many''--flowed naturally. 
The emergence of both communities--albeit in pursuit of opposite ends--forms the key reference point for a European identity. 
The German philosopher Karl Jaspers once said that European liberty was founded on the antitheses of ``the secular world and transcendence, science and faith, material technology and religion.'' 
So the EU should not be afraid to affirm both medieval Christianity's community of faith and the modern era's community of reason. 
Only this will do justice to the contradictory essence of the European spirit. 
But by this standard, the preamble of the draft European Constitution drawn up by the Convention is utterly inadequate. 
Initially, the Convention refused to include any mention of Christianity or Europe's Judeo-Christian heritage whatsoever, citing only the Enlightenment tradition, alongside the Greeks and Romans. 
Although a compromise solution was provisionally accepted, its message is weak and obscure. 
A pity. 
To be sure, Europe has paid a heavy and painful price for its religious rifts, and these feuds must not be rekindled. 
But the Constitution must not only introduce more clarity, transparency, and efficiency into the workings of European institutions; it must also bring the EU closer to its citizens. 
This calls for a bit of ``European metaphysics.'' 
EU leaders should talk about the European idea and the European spirit in a way that encourages Europe's citizens to think about how they came together, why they are staying together, and what they want to do together. 
The answer seems to revolve around the central place that European civilisation has given the human person since mixing barbarian customs with Christianity. 
This anthropocentric vision is carried by the Christian tradition in the message that man is made in the image of God and that the Son of God sacrificed himself for man. 
But we also find it in the Enlightenment tradition, which declares that man is the measure of all things or that he is vested with grandeur and dignity. 
The dual foundation of European thought makes it possible to transcend the conflict between religion and secularism that accompanied the recent debate on the ideological bases of the constitution. 
By taking the model of a civilisation that puts man and his dignity in a central position, it can also be the starting point for a genuine discussion on the future of Europe. 
The danger here is that ``community values'' might become a partition that generates attitudes and policies of exclusion. 
On the contrary, the concept of human dignity must encourage a radical opening towards others. Europe owes it to itself to be pluralist, aware of its cultural debt to the Greeks and Romans, the Arabs and the Jews, learning from its own experience the power of tolerance and the poverty and shame of closed, totalitarian ideologies. 
In fact, human rights must define the very image of Europe; it must be its emblem or even its ``religion.'' 
Human rights should be the ideological benchmark for Europe's internal politics and foreign policy--otherwise, the creation of the post of EU foreign affairs minister will remain a dead letter. 
Europe should base the multilateralism of its foreign policy on human rights, while working on reforming international law and the UN system to ensure that human rights win out over short-sighted political calculations. 
But most importantly, European integration must not only define institutions and policies, but it must also galvanise ideas. 
The role of the intellectual debate on the future of Europe is to strengthen European solidarity, to produce ideas and visions that are powerful enough to show realistically what direction to take, and to mobilise the imagination to build a powerful, courageous, and lucid community. 
The Two-Faced Economy 
ROME: Italy's economy has two faces. 
On one side, sectors of the economy demonstrate extraordinary productivity, and have won big shares of international markets. 
For example, the mechanical industries in the Veneto and in Emilia led by Carararo, and Ducati, as well as the optical industry in the Northeast with Luxottica in the lead. 
These are firms known across the globe, and which are often the objects of acquisitive interest from foreign competitors or great international investors, such as Piaggio and Stefanel. 
On the other hand, Italy's economy as a whole is stagnant: in the last ten years Italy has been growing more slowly than the median in Europe, which is already seeing much lower growth rates than the United States. 
In the last eight years per capita GDP has increased, on average, by 3.2% per year in America, 2% in Europe, and only 1.2% in Italy. 
How are these two economic facts to be reconciled and what does this divided economy tell us about Europe, east and west, as well as other economies where the percentage of people in work may be stagnant or falling? 
The answer is at the same time simple and rich in consequences for economic policy. 
GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by the total population) depends on two factors: the productivity of those who work (that is, GDP divided by the number of people employed), and the number of people who work as a proportion of the population. 
In order for an increase in the productivity of those who work to result in a growth of GDP per capita it is necessary that productivity growth not be not nullified by a simultaneous reduction in the number, and thus the proportion, of those who work. 
Such a reduction happens not only when unemployment goes up, but also when the number of those who do not participate in the labor force grows: students, retired people, the unemployed who are discouraged and stop looking for work and so abandon the labor force. 
In Italy, the country's stagnant GDP masks two phenomena which cancel each other out. 
Productivity grows due to the expansion of the most dynamic and efficient firms, but the percentage of those who work is decreasing all the time. 
The result is that the productive sectors of the economy do not succeed in "pulling" with them the ever greater mass of people who do not work. 
Data on labor force participation is almost incredible. 
The ratio of the labor force (that is those who are employed and those unemployed who are actively looking for work) to the number of people of working age is equal to 75% in USA, 76% in Great Britain, around 68% in France and Germany, and 58% in Italy. 
This is the lowest number in all of the European Union. 
Among OECD countries, the only one with a percentage of participation in the economy lower than that of Italy is Turkey, where 53% of the population makes up the labor force. 
Considering that the Italian 58% includes the unemployed, only about half of Italians of working age are now working or even looking for work. 
This percentage is lower today than in 1970, while in the United States the equivalent number has increased from 65% to 78%. 
True, a small part of the near half of the population who officially do not work are employed in the underground economy, but this is small consolation; certainly it is not in those sectors that the future of the Italian economy is to be found. 
What accounts for this propensity of people not to look for work, and why does what is happening in Italy matter to other countries? 
First of all, an extremely generous system of retirement benefits makes the "no work" option attractive, though not quite obligatory. 
Indeed, abandoning work at an ever younger age relative to the longer life expectancy of Italians is something particularly worrying. 
In the second place, low labor force participation is a response to the heightened fiscal pressure that results from the burden of having to pay for all the retirement pensions of today's fifty-year-olds. 
The pressure affects those who do work and, because of the heavier tax burden, makes work less attractive for them, especially for the second members of a family. 
When a man works and marginal tax rates are very high, the wife very often prefers to stay at home. 
Finally, the propensity not to look for work results from a university system that accepts anyone and which does not offer any disincentive to those who seek to indefinitely prolong their so-called "studies." 
This state of affairs is reproduced inside individual families: young people of 30 survive thanks to the work of the head of the family, who supports everyone. 
Reform of the pension system is often attacked as a zero-sum game, in which whatever one person loses another gains. 
Put in these terms, the problem is always solved by giving more to those who have the most political power. 
Professor Nicola Rossi, economic advisor to Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, in the title of his recent book, expresses the wish that we give "Less to the Fathers and More to the Sons." 
But if unions are powerful or seniors are in the majority (in Italy the two coincide, because seniors are the majority in all labor unions), the exact opposite happens. 
Italy's recent budget, which neither confronted the pensions issue nor the issue of fiscal reform, demonstrates this fully. 
Here is the grand delusion of the budget and the Finance Ministry in Italy. 
Neither seems capable, and in fact neither has tried to understand, that we are not dealing with a zero some gain. 
Those countries who also provide disincentives to work should keep Italy's sluggishness in mind and learn the lessons Italy's government has ignored. 
The Two Faces of Berlusconi 
Silvio Berlusconi has endured a bumpy first month of his six-month presidency of the EU. 
Much of Europe is getting its first close look at Italy's billionaire Prime Minister, and many do not like what they see. 
But Europe should look beyond Berlusconi's careless tongue when gauging the nature of his regime. 
They may still not like what he stands for and how he governs, but they will see that he is not the unchallenged ``strong man'' that some Europeans imagine. 
Berlusconi's center-right coalition won election in 2001 by claiming to be the sole political force capable of launching--and completing--an ambitious reform program. 
Sadly for Italy, Premier Berlusconi turned out to have two reform agendas. 
One is focused on his own judicial and economic interests (call this his ``personal reform'' program), much of which he has pursued and implemented ruthlessly. 
The other, ``general reform'' agenda, has attracted scarcely any of his energy, and seems unlikely to do so. 
Italy's Parliament, where Berlusconi's ruling coalition holds an overwhelming majority, has passed four laws designed to safeguard the Prime Minister against prosecution and conviction. 
One legal ``reform'' almost abolishes the crime of false accounting; another makes it difficult, if not impossible, to collect evidence of a crime from abroad. 
A third new law allows trials to be transferred to courts in other jurisdictions if there is ``legitimate suspicion'' that the judges are ``biased''--a claim Berlusconi repeatedly makes against the Milan magistrates (he calls them ``red magistrates'') investigating him. 
Finally, a law grants immunity from prosecution to the five highest state officials, including, obviously, the Prime Minister. 
Berlusconi has been equally active in pushing reforms that serve his economic interests. 
The Chamber of Deputies is poised to enact a law only the White Queen in Alice in Wonderland could love. 
This law defines ``conflicts of interest'' in such a way that, although the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a media empire cannot be Prime Minister, the man who actually owns that empire can. 
More worrying is a proposed law that strengthens the oligopolistic power of Berlusconi's television and advertising corporations while weakening the public television service. 
Where such personally beneficial laws are concerned, Premier Berlusconi is bull-headed, almost wrecking his coalition recently when one junior minister threatened to resign after the justice ministry sought to stop all investigations into Berlusconi's affairs. 
But such energy and commitment is utterly lacking where Berlusconi's wider reform agenda is concerned. 
For example, the government sought to amend Article 18 of the ``Workers' Statute,'' which compels big firms to reinstate workers dismissed without ``just cause.'' 
It sought this change because it believed firms would not hire people they could never fire. 
Massive industrial action forced the government to back down. 
Now it says that such a reform is neither urgent nor necessary. 
Similarly, the government proclaims bold intentions to tackle reform of Italy's deeply indebted pension system, but lacks the political leverage to realize change. 
Indeed, a powerful component of the Berlusconi coalition, the Northern League, staunchly opposes a core component of the proposed reform--abolition of early retirement--because ending early retirement is contrary to workers' interests in the North, where the party has its electoral base. 
The government pledged to reduce the tax burden by about 10% of GDP. 
But reaching this figure will not be possible--even if scaled back--because the government seems unable to curb public spending and because the European Commission will not accept new budgetary subterfuges from Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti aimed at evading the constraints imposed by the Euro-zone's Growth and Stability Pact. 
On the contrary, state and local taxes actually increased over the past year. 
From the Economic and Financial Policy Forecast Document (2003-2008), now being scrutinized by Parliament, one deduces that taxes will fall by a mere 1% of GDP in the period between 2001 (when Berlusconi took office) and 2008. 
Finally, the Northern League demands that fiscal federalism should be the main goal of reform. 
Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, made three promises before the last elections: to reduce the tax burden; to halt clandestine immigration; and to devolve powers from the central government in Rome to regional administrations. 
Bossi now knows that the first two promises cannot be kept. 
So he must deliver on the third, or the League will be gravely wounded. 
But two other government parties, the National Alliance (a nationalist party) and the UDC (a Catholic one) have their electoral bases mainly in the South and oppose Bossi's project because it conflicts with their interests. 
The schisms within the ruling coalition could be overcome if Berlusconi had the strength to distribute the costs and benefits of reform among its member parties. 
But Berlusconi's leadership is based on his skill as a communicator (which declines as expectations go unfulfilled) more than on his skill as a mediator among squabbling allies. 
Unless a robust international economic boom (unlikely) unexpectedly aids Berlusconi's government, we will hear more talk about reform but see even less action. 
So by the time Italy's six-month presidency of the EU concludes, the rude reception Berlusconi received at the European Parliament may find an echo at home. 
The Two Faces of Vladimir Putin 
Russia’s split personality – symbolized by its Tsarist coat of arms, a two-headed eagle – has been on open display recently. 
One minute, President Vladimir Putin’s regime is on a charm offensive, desiring a settlement to its six-decade-old territorial dispute with Japan over the Kurile Islands and reassuring investors following the conviction of oil billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky. 
The next moment Putin balks at removing Russia’s military garrison from Moldova’s secessionist Transdniester region while prosecutors talk ominously of putting more oligarchs in the dock. 
Perhaps the greatest display of this political schizophrenia took place last month in Red Square, where a witch’s brew of Red “Victory” flags, tri-color “Imperial” flags, Stalin portraits, and Orthodox icons marched side by side during the 60th anniversary celebration marking WWII’s end. 
Putin took that occasion to repeat his political mantra – “Russia is developing it’s own brand of democracy” – while spurning requests from the Baltic countries that Russia come clean about its deal with Hitler to devour them on WWII’s eve. 
This bizarre brew appears to have been concocted in an effort to reconcile the irreconcilable: the current yearning for democracy with Russia’s despotic past. 
But, like any muddle, it is succeeding only in confusing Russians about themselves and their country. 
Strangely, Putin seems as trapped by this muddle as everybody else. 
At times, Putin truly sees himself as a “modernizer” seeking to root Russia in the West. 
At other times, like Stalin, he believes that Russia’s power requires a strong hand – what he calls his “dictatorship of law.” 
The problem, as Khodorkovsky’s conviction demonstrated, is that dictatorship usually seems to be trumping law. 
Historically, attempts at modernization in Russia, even when they look real, as with Stalin’s industrialization or Yeltsin’s market reforms, ultimately result in a Potemkin village-like state of affairs, because Russian society cannot change fast enough or with the patience necessary to see the changes through. 
So, when Yeltsin’s American-style democratization of the 1990’s failed to bring “orderly” capitalism instantly, Putin on his accession imposed a restoration of state “order,” as if a stable political or economic system demanded a fusing of the Soviet past with the Orthodox Church and Mother Russia imagery. 
Indeed, Putin’s signature characteristic is to be all men for all Russia’s people. 
By blending the Soviet past with the Tsarist past and a few shards of Yeltsin-era democracy, Putin seems to think that he can neutralize the extremes of Russian history. 
Instead, the extremes seem to be squeezing out the desire for modernization. 
High oil prices now seem to be the only factor allowing Putin to keep the reform charade going. 
The nineteenth-century czar Alexander III once said: “Russia has only two true allies – its army and its navy.” 
Alexander's formula is also popular today with Putin’s nationalists in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
In his pro-imperial Russia film “The Barber of Siberia,” the Oscar-winning director Nikita Mikhalkov – whose father composed the Stalin-era national anthem that Putin recently revived – used the coronation of Alexander III as the symbolic centerpiece of Russia’s greatness, inviting Russian leaders to walk in his footsteps. 
This strong-willed monarch, while ruling the Russian empire autocratically, managed to bring stability and prosperity, allowing capitalism to take root. 
He worked to strengthen and modernize Russia’s armed forces while avoiding armed conflict. 
He became known as “The Peasants’ Tsar,” though he didn’t tolerate any opposition thinking contrary to his own. 
Putin sees his own crusade to save Russia from disintegration and separatism as similar to Alexander’s. 
But how forward-looking is it to model a twenty-first-century country on the absolutist example of the past? 
Stalin is yet another cherished role model. 
Here, too, Putin tries to walk on both sides of the street, calling Koba a tyrant to sooth the wounded feelings the Baltic leaders, yet instantly qualifying his remarks by saying that Stalin was no Hitler. 
Can we really compare the degree of evil of these two men? 
Despite his insistence on rubbing shoulders with world leaders and portraying himself as a modernizer, Putin, like his predecessors, is in fact a ruler who believes that only authoritarian rule can protect his country from anarchy and disintegration. 
But the old ideas, the mimicry and symbols Putin employs to achieve his goals, no longer correspond to today’s realities or Russia’s present capabilities. 
Previously, it was Russia’s Western mission that was pure Potemkin village. 
Now Russianness itself seems to lack a secure foundation, for it is but a hollow shell of discarded state symbols. 
Like a bad driver, a nation that looks left and right but never ahead is bound to crash. 
The Tyranny of King Cotton 
Americans like to think that if poor countries simply open up their markets, greater prosperity will follow. 
Unfortunately, where agriculture is concerned, this is mere rhetoric. 
The United States pays only lip service to free market principles, favoring Washington lobbyists and campaign contributors who demand just the opposite. 
Indeed, it is America’s own agricultural subsidies that helped kill, at least for now, the so-called Doha Development Round of trade negotiations that were supposed to give poor countries new opportunities to enhance their growth. 
Subsidies hurt developing country farmers because they lead to higher output – and lower global prices. 
The Bush administration – supposedly committed to free markets around the world – has actually almost doubled the level of agricultural subsidies in the US. 
Cotton illustrates the problem. 
Without subsidies, it would not pay for Americans to produce much cotton; with them, the US is the world’s largest cotton exporter. 
Some 25,000 rich American cotton farmers divide $3 to $4 billion in subsidies among themselves – with most of the money going to a small fraction of the recipients. 
The increased supply depresses cotton prices, hurting some 10 million farmers in sub-Saharan Africa alone. 
Seldom have so few done so much damage to so many. 
That damage is all the greater when we consider how America’s trade subsidies contributed to the demise of the Doha Round. 
Rather than offering to do away with its cotton subsidies, America offered to open up American markets to cotton imports – an essentially meaningless public-relations move that quickly backfired. 
Owing to its huge subsidies, America exports cotton, and it would import little even if formal barriers are removed. 
Thus, recent trade negotiations have a surreal air about them, because, whatever their outcome, ultimately cotton subsidies will have to go. 
Brazil, frustrated with America’s intransigence, brought a case against US cotton subsidies before the WTO, which ruled as almost any economist would: the subsidies distort world trade and are therefore prohibited. 
Faced with the WTO order, the US will try to comply with the letter of the law and avoid its spirit, making changes in the subsidy program to ensure “technical” compliance. 
But these attempts will almost surely fail; in the end – though it may take years – cotton subsidies will be eliminated. 
Of course, the European Union’s subsidies are far larger, but, in contrast to the US, Europe has made some effort to reduce them, especially export subsidies. 
While export subsidies appear more obviously “trade distorting,” America’s cotton and other subsidies are in fact almost as bad. 
When subsidies lead to increased production with little increase in consumption, as is typical with agricultural commodities, higher output translates directly into higher exports, which translate directly into lower prices for producers, lower incomes for farmers, and more poverty in the Third world, including millions of cotton farmers eking out subsistence incomes in semi-arid conditions. 
America and other advanced countries are the real losers from the demise of the Doha Round. 
Had the Bush administration fulfilled its commitments, Americans taxpayers would have benefited from the elimination of huge agricultural subsidies – a real boon in this era of yawning budget deficits. 
Americans would have been better off as consumers, too, with increased access to a variety of low-cost goods from poor countries. 
Likewise, migration pressure would have been reduced, because it is the huge disparity in incomes more than anything else that leads people to leave their homes and families to immigrate to the US. 
A fair trade regime would have helped reduce that disparity. 
Indeed, citizens throughout the rich developed world all stand to benefit from a more prosperous globe – especially a world in which there is less poverty, with fewer people facing despair. 
For we all suffer from the political instability to which such despair gives rise. 
But it is America that perhaps now stands to gain the most by reviving the Doha talks with a more credible and generous offer. 
America’s influence in the world has suffered greatly in the last few years; the Bush administration’s hypocritical use of free-market rhetoric while pursuing protectionist policies has made matters worse. 
America’s national interests thus dictate a change of policy. 
But there is also another powerful rationale for doing so: treating fairly those who are poorer and less powerful is the morally right thing to do. 
The Ultimate Computer 
The personal computer on my desktop is hundreds of times as fast, and has thousands of times as much memory, as the mainframe computer that served my entire university when I was a student. 
Such advances in the processing speed and storage capacity of computers are expected to continue until the laws of physics impose certain limits. 
After all, we cannot shrink atoms or increase the speed of light. 
Now, imagine a computer technology that eventually approaches these limits. 
Imagine further that every star in every galaxy in the observable universe could somehow be fashioned into computers of this ``ultimate'' type. 
That would be a lot of very fast computers. 
Or if they were connected together we could think of them as a single, massively parallel computer: call it the ``Universe Computer.'' 
Admittedly, there are tasks - word processing, for example - at which this imaginary computer would be no more useful than any one of its constituent computers operating independently. 
But for large, repetitive trial-and-error tasks, such as code breaking, the speed and power of this integrated ``Universe Computer'' would be vastly superior to anything we could ever hope to build, right? 
Hold that thought. 
Quantum theory - the branch of physics that deals with elementary particles and the microscopic properties of matter - has produced some of our deepest insights into nature, and describes some startlingly counter-intuitive phenomena. 
For example, it implies that elementary particles, rather than being located at one position at a time, travel on several trajectories simultaneously. 
No one disputes that quantum phenomena, if they could be harnessed, would revolutionize information processing, enabling ways of computing that no existing computer, even in principle, would be capable of duplicating. 
Among the tasks for which quantum computing would be ideally suited are ``algorithmic searches.'' 
Put simply, algorithmic searches are what computer programmers use as a last resort when looking for a mathematical needle in a haystack: they make the computer try every possible answer in turn until it finds the right one. 
Obviously, the resources required for such searches are proportional to the number of possible answers: common sense tells us that trying a thousand possibilities requires a thousand times as many operations as trying one. 
Trying a million possibilities requires a million times as many operations. 
But our ordinary common sense does not apply in fundamental physics. 
In 1996, the computer scientist Lov Grover discovered a quantum algorithm - a way to program a quantum computer - that could try out a million possibilities in only a thousand times the time needed to try one, and a trillion possibilities in only a million times the time of one, and so on, without limit. 
What would happen inside a quantum computer when it performs an algorithmic search? 
The unseemly truth is that most physicists are perplexed and embarrassed by this question. 
Many explain away quantum phenomena with weasel words, or worse, they simply eschew explanation altogether. 
True, quantum phenomena cannot be observed directly. 
But we can deduce their existence and attributes by measuring their effects on things that are directly observable. 
We have never observed live dinosaurs, either, but we know they existed - and quite a lot about how they worked - from the fossil record. 
A growing minority of physicists, myself included, accept the ``many universes'' interpretation of quantum mechanics. 
We concluded that what we observe as a single particle is really one of countless similar entities in different universes, subtly affecting each other through a process called ``quantum interference.'' 
To us, no mystery exists in quantum computation, only wonder. 
Quantum computing, according to this view, is possible because a quantum computer performs vast numbers of separate computations in different universes and then shares the results through quantum interference. 
The equations of quantum theory describe this phenomenon step by step. 
But because such information sharing is achievable only through quantum interference, these same equations also drastically limit the types of task that quantum computation should be able to perform, or speed up. 
Direct communication between universes is, for example, ruled out. 
In fact, only a handful of potentially useful quantum algorithms are known at present. 
Grover's algorithm is one. 
Other known quantum algorithms will easily be able to crack the most widely used secure cryptographic systems of today. 
Coincidentally, cryptographic systems which themselves use quantum computation are already commonplace in laboratories, heralding the development of communication that is both perfectly secure - even against quantum attack - and immune to future advances in mathematics or technology. 
Quantum cryptography happens to be relatively easy to implement. 
Unfortunately, we have no computers powerful enough to run any other useful quantum algorithm; building powerful quantum computers is a major scientific and technological challenge for the coming decades. 
But theoretical physicists already know how many different types of components are required to make a quantum computer, and how complicated these components must be. 
The astonishing answer is that virtually any interaction between two information-carrying entities, including atoms or elementary particles, will do. 
As the physicist Seth Lloyd commented, ``almost anything becomes a computer if you shine the right kind of light on it.'' 
It has long been assumed that a single type of machine, given time and memory, could simulate the behavior of any other state of matter. 
It turns out that existing computers, or even the imaginary ``Universe Computer,'' are not the ones. 
But a general-purpose quantum computer would be. 
In quantum physics, this ``computational universality'' is part of the essence of all matter - and thus of the comprehensibility of nature. 
No other branch of physics involves such wide-ranging interaction between theory, experiment, technology, and philosophy. 
No other field of scientific research holds more promising implications for our understanding of the universe. 
The Ultimate Nuclear Test 
NEW YORK – On 1 November, a team of over 35 experts will launch an exercise to inspect a simulated nuclear test site near the Dead Sea in Jordan—a step forward in completing the global verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). 
Then on 12 November, the world’s Nobel Peace Laureates will hold a summit in Hiroshima to stress the priority of nuclear disarmament and affirm their commitment to promoting it. 
Countless other international initiatives are also underway that reflect a wider revolution in thinking about nuclear weapons—a revolution that is welcome and long overdue. 
After all, despite much talk of nuclear disarmament when the Cold War ended 20 years ago, more than 20,000 of these weapons still exist, with many on high alert, and each much larger than the devices that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. 
Nine countries are known or believed to possess them, and all are improving them in various ways. 
Let’s be clear, the very existence of these weapons aggravates three global nuclear threats – from existing arsenals (accidents, miscalculations, unauthorized use, or willful use), from their proliferation to additional states, and from their acquisition by terrorists. 
But now a new global consensus is emerging that these weapons are militarily irrelevant in dealing with emerging threats, impossible to use without violating international humanitarian law, a source of proliferation and terrorist threats, and a waste of money and scientific talent. 
This helps to explain why we are seeing new demands to start good-faith negotiations on nuclear disarmament, as has long been required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made a persuasive case for work to begin on a nuclear-weapons convention, or a framework of separate agreements resulting in a global ban. 
Even the leaders of the nuclear-weapon states are now officially supporting the goal of global nuclear disarmament. 
They are joined by former statesmen, national parliaments and regional organizations, mayors, retired military experts, women’s organizations, human rights activists, environmentalists, and countless other groups worldwide. 
Yes, nuclear disarmament has gone viral. 
It is now mainstream – a fitting subject for even die-hard realists to consider and no longer a cause promoted by peace groups alone. 
We believe that this momentum is absolutely vital to international peace and security, and there are many ways to reinforce it. 
Achieving global nuclear disarmament will surely require new legal obligations for all states, nuclear and non-nuclear. 
To be blunt, the rule of law must be brought to disarmament. 
Commitments in this sensitive field must be made irreversible and subject to strict verification. 
These tasks cannot be accomplished unilaterally – multilateral cooperation is indispensable. 
Of course, some progress in treaty-making by smaller groups of states is possible, particularly by those with the largest nuclear arsenals, the Russian Federation and the United States. 
Early ratification of the US-Russia START treaty would be a step in the right direction. 
Yet other advances of the rule of law in nuclear disarmament will require cooperation on a global scale. 
One of the most important and overdue developments in this area is the entry into force of the CTBT, which will outlaw all nuclear explosions, regardless of their size, location, or declared purpose. 
The idea of outlawing such tests was first floated in 1954 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who framed his proposal in the context of broader progress toward nuclear disarmament, just as we are doing today. 
The CTBT has now been signed by 182 states and will enter into force after being ratified by nine more: China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and the US, while Indonesia has announced it will ratify it soon. 
This ban on nuclear tests will be backed up with a verification regime that spans the globe. 
Even today, thanks to a variety of sophisticated means, we can detect very small nuclear tests in remote locations. 
The treaty is also fair—it includes the same rights and responsibilities for all its parties. 
It sets a new standard for nuclear weapons treaty obligations and verification. 
The CTBT is needed because of the role of nuclear tests in the development and improvement of nuclear weapons. 
Such tests are also political symbols that have no place in a world determined to eliminate these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction. 
On an issue as important as this, voluntary promises not to test are simply not enough. 
Other treaties are needed as well, especially one outlawing the production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons. 
We believe that non-nuclear-weapon states also deserve legally binding assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons. 
Moreover, there is merit in seeking additional treaties to outlaw weapons in space, establish agreed norms for missile defense, and make certain that nuclear materials and technologies are kept safe and secure. 
Together, these steps will take us far down the road to a nuclear-weapon-free world – not as an act of faith, but as a prudent investment in the peace and security of all peoples. 
This would be perhaps the greatest legacy we could leave for future generations. 
The UN Heresy 
No other organization is held in such respect as the United Nations. 
This is perhaps natural, for the UN embodies some of humanity's noblest dreams. 
But, as the current scandal surrounding the UN's administration of the Iraq oil for food program demonstrates, and as the world remembers the Rwanda genocide that began ten years ago, respect for the UN should be viewed as something of a superstition, with Secretary General Kofi Annan its false prophet. 
Not since Dag Hammarskjöld has a UN leader been as acclaimed as Annan. 
Up to a point, this is understandable. 
Annan usually maintains an unruffled, dignified demeanor. 
He has charm and - many say - charisma. 
But a leader ought to be judged by his or her actions when important matters are at stake. 
Annan's failures in such situations are almost invariably glossed over. 
Between 1993 and 1996, Annan was Assistant Secretary-General for UN Peacekeeping Operations and then Under-Secretary-General. 
One of the two great disasters for which he bears a large share of the blame is the Serbian slaughter of 7,000 people in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, perhaps the worst massacre in postwar Europe. 
In 1993, Bosnia's Muslems were promised that UN forces would protect them. 
This commitment was a precondition of their consenting to disarm. 
The UN declared Srebrenica a "safe haven" to be "protected" by 600 Dutch UN troops. 
In July 1995, Serb forces attacked. 
The UN did not honor its pledge. 
Annan's staff released evasive, confused statements. 
Oblivious, apparently, to the dreadfulness of the situation, they failed to sound the alarm properly and did nothing to intervene. 
The Dutch fired not a single shot. 
NATO air power could have halted the Serbs, but Annan did not ask for NATO intervention. 
Ratko Mladic, the Serb commander and war criminal, deported the women and children under the eyes of the UN, while capturing and murdering the men and adolescent boys. 
No one should be surprised by the UN's inaction, because only the year before it had demonstrated utter incompetence in facing the fastest genocide in history - the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in just 100 days. 
UN forces in Rwanda in 1994 were Annan's responsibility before and during the crisis. 
Annan was alerted four months before Hutu activists began their mass killings by a fax message from Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian general commanding UN forces in Rwanda. 
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning "anti-Tutsi extermination." 
He identified his source "a Hutu" and reported that arms were ready for the impending ethnic cleansing. 
Dallaire requested permission to evacuate his informant and to seize the arms cache. 
Annan rejected both demands, proposing that Dallaire make the informant's identity known to Rwandan President Habyarimana, a Hutu, even though the informant had expressly named the President's closest entourage as the authors of the genocide blueprint. 
Annan maintained his extreme passiveness even after the airplane crash that killed Habyarimana, which signaled the genocide's start, helped by the indifference of the great powers (America not least). 
One might think Annan far too compromised for the post of Secretary-General, but the UN doesn't work that way. 
Instead of being forced to resign after Rwanda and Srebrenica, he was promoted to Secretary-General. 
That is the culture of the UN: believe the best of barbarians, do nothing to provoke controversy among superiors, and let others be the butt of criticism afterwards. 
Even subsequent revelations about Annan's responsibility for the disasters in Rwanda and Bosnia did not affect his standing. 
On the contrary, he was unanimously re-elected and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
He is the all-time Teflon diplomat. 
The media sometimes ratchets up admiration for Annan by pointing out that his wife is Swedish and a close relative of Raoul Wallenberg. 
We are meant to infer that, on top of all his talents, Annan shares the ideals embodied during the last days of WWII by the foremost Swede of modern times. 
But Wallenberg's name should make us even more dismayed about Annan's record. 
Wallenberg refused to ignore the threat of massacres to come. 
Instead of ducking responsibility and carrying on with conventional work in Sweden, he made his way to Hungary, the scene of Hitler's last homicidal orgy against the Jews. 
In Budapest, Wallenberg exploited every available contact, resorting to shady tricks, bribes, and other stratagems to save as many people as possible from the Holocaust. 
He never allowed himself to be duped by Hitler's cronies. 
Perhaps no one's achievement should be judged by comparison with that of Wallenberg - a titan of strength, courage, and perseverance. 
The trouble with Annan is that, when similar perils loomed, he proved especially wanting. 
Annan cannot plead that he faced any risk to his personal safety, whereas Wallenberg in 1944 and 1945 was in constant peril. 
Nor can he possibly excuse himself by saying that no warnings were given, or that he lacked resources, or that he did not have the international position to intervene. 
Annan had at his disposal all of the instruments of power and opinion that Wallenberg lacked. 
Yet when thousands or hundreds of thousands of people were exposed to mortal threats that he had the authority and duty to avert, alleviate, or at least announce, he failed abjectly. 
Now, despite the recent revelations about briberies in the UN's oil-for-food program for Iraq, the world is clamoring to entrust Annan with the future of more than 20 million Iraqis who survived Saddam Hussein's depraved dictatorship. 
That is both because of who Annan is and what the UN has become: an institution in which no shortcoming, it seems, goes unrewarded. 
The UN’s Mandate Gap 
The United Nations peacekeeping operations now underway in Lebanon offer a big opportunity for the UN to demonstrate its relevance and impact on the world stage in the 21st century. 
If only those member states who claim to be the UN’s biggest supporters put their money where their mouths are. 
Many world leaders, particularly those in Europe, decry the Bush administration’s undermining of the UN, especially since 2003. 
Yet leaders in France, who expressed outrage when the US sidestepped the UN and invaded Iraq without the international community’s blessing, stunned the world in August when they backed down from their promise to send 2,000 peacekeepers to intervene in southern Lebanon, and instead only committed 200. 
Fortunately, France has reconsidered, Germany will provide limited naval assistance, and Italy has stepped up to contribute 3,000 peacekeepers. In addition, China has recently pledged 1,000 troops. 
But Europe’s response, like the US response in other cases, highlights a critical issue for all supporters of the UN and international institutions more generally. 
If we cannot do what it takes to make them more effective, we will increasingly find that nations will bypass them altogether. 
UN Security Council Resolution 1701 “calls for Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire.” 
It thus set the stage for UN officials to establish the “Rules of Engagement” (ROEs) for its peacekeepers, which dictate when and under what circumstances UN troops can fire their weapons to defend themselves. 
But as the current UN mission in Lebanon (UNIFIL) well knows, defending yourself is not the same as protecting yourself from hostile fire in the first place. 
In this context, the French are understandably worried about the fate of their soldiers – soldiers charged with supporting the Lebanese government in its efforts to establish control over the Hezbollah-controlled south. 
The terrible French peacekeeping experience in Bosnia in the early 1990s, in which France lost 84 soldiers serving in a humanitarian capacity under restrictive ROEs, justifies their fears. 
But ROEs are only the symptom of a deeper problem. 
The real issue is a yawning gap between paper and practice. 
In the heat of an international crisis, the Security Council passes resolutions to great public fanfare, establishing an official UN “mandate.” 
But then the UN Secretary General is left, resolution in hand, to ask UN member states for the actual, tangible resources necessary to implement what has been commanded. 
In the overwhelming majority of cases, those resources fall far short of what is required to successfully intervene in a crisis. 
A 2006 UN mandate review finds that UN member states adopt hundreds of mandates each year, conferring “additional responsibilities with neither corresponding funds nor guidance” on how resources should be used. 
In American domestic politics, these kinds of commands from the US Congress to states are known as “unfunded mandates;” ordering results without providing the resources necessary to achieve them. 
It’s political theater - big headlines, small results. 
The UN’s experience in Lebanon is not encouraging. 
According to the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations, up to now UNIFIL has operated on an annual budget of $94 million and suffers chronic budget shortfalls due to unpaid assessments from member states. 
Now consider what an expanded UNIFIL is mandated to do under Resolution 1701: peacekeepers must monitor the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah; support and accompany the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy in southern Lebanon; assist Lebanon’s government in securing the country’s borders and ports to keep illegal weapons from getting into Hezbollah’s hands; and “help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.” 
This is a Herculean task. 
But over a month after the resolution, barely 5,000 troops are deployed. 
Even if all 15,000 UN troops could be found and deployed, the challenges in Lebanon will remain daunting. 
The UN insists that Resolution 1701 does not mandate that the UN disarm Hezbollah; almost no nation other than Israel is willing to charge its soldiers with that task. 
Instead, the job falls to the Lebanese government and armed forces, who need all the help they can get from the international community. 
That is only the military aspect of the peacekeeping effort. 
Lebanon’s infrastructure – especially in the south – has been decimated. 
Homes and livelihoods have been destroyed. 
Who will build or re-build hospitals? 
How will communications infrastructure be rebuilt? 
Who will repair Lebanon’s bridges and roads? 
The mandate gap reflects the way the world has done business with the UN for decades – big promises, small pay-outs, much scapegoating if the UN then fails. 
But today the international community has a tremendous window of opportunity to secure a small but significant peace in the Middle East along the volatile border of Lebanon and Israel. 
How member states respond now – especially those who believe in the purpose and value of the UN - may help shape the outcomes of other, wider ongoing regional conflicts, notably with Iran and Syria, both of which support Hezbollah. 
The UN provides the mechanism for a global response, but as Kofi Annan often repeats, it does not exist apart from its member states. 
It is up to those members – to all of our governments - to provide both the necessary will and the required resources. 
Otherwise the UN is nothing more than a handy mechanism for outsourcing political blame. 
Our commitment to bring peace to the Middle East, or Darfur, or Congo, or Kosovo, or Haiti, is not measured by our words but by our wallets. 
The world gets what it pays for. 
The UN Takes Charge 
NEW YORK – While discussions about economic “green shoots” continue unabated in the United States, in many countries, and especially in the developing world, matters are getting worse. 
The downturn in the US began with a failure in the financial system, which quickly was translated into a slowdown in the real economy. 
But, in the developing world, it is just the opposite: a decline in exports, reduced remittances, lower foreign direct investment, and precipitous falls in capital flows have led to economic weakening. 
As a result, even countries with good regulatory systems are now confronting problems in their financial sectors. 
On June 23, a United Nations conference focusing on the global economic crisis and its impact on developing countries reached a consensus both about the causes of the downturn and why it was affecting developing countries so badly. 
It outlined some of the measures that should be considered and established a working group to explore the way forward, possibly under the guidance of a newly established expert group. 
The agreement was remarkable: in providing what in many ways was a clearer articulation of the crisis and what needs to be done than that offered by the G-20, the UN showed that decision-making needn’t be restricted to a self-selected club, lacking political legitimacy, and largely dominated by those who had considerable responsibility for the crisis in the first place. 
Indeed, the agreement showed the value of a more inclusive approach – for example, by asking key questions that might be too politically sensitive for some of the larger countries to raise, or by pointing out concerns that resonate with the poorest, even if they are less important for the richest. 
One might have thought that the United States would have taken a leadership role, since the crisis was made there. 
Indeed, the US Treasury (including some officials who are currently members of President Barack Obama’s economic team) pushed capital- and financial-market liberalization, which resulted in the rapid contagion of America’s problems around the world. 
While there was less American leadership than one would have hoped, indeed expected under the circumstances, many participants were simply relieved that America did not put up obstacles to reaching a global consensus, as would have been the case if George W. Bush were still president. 
One might have hoped that America would be the first to offer large amounts of money to help the many innocent victims of the policies it had championed. 
But it did not, and Obama had to fight hard to extract even limited amounts for the International Monetary Fund from a reluctant Congress. 
But many developing countries have just emerged from being overburdened with debt; they do not want to go through that again. 
The implication is that they need grants, not loans. 
The G-20, which turned to the IMF to provide most of the money that the developing countries need to cope with the crisis, did not take sufficient note of this; the UN conference did. 
The most sensitive issue touched upon by the UN conference – too sensitive to be discussed at the G-20 – was reform of the global reserve system. 
The build-up of reserves contributes to global imbalances and insufficient global aggregate demand, as countries put aside hundreds of billions of dollars as a precaution against global volatility. Not surprisingly, America, which benefits by getting trillions of dollars of loans from developing countries – now at almost no interest – was not enthusiastic about the discussion. 
But, whether the US likes it or not, the dollar reserve system is fraying; the question is only whether we move from the current system to an alternative in a haphazard way, or in a more careful and structured way. 
Those with large amounts of reserves know that holding dollars is a bad deal: no or low return and a high risk of inflation or currency depreciation, either of which would diminish their holdings’ real value. 
On the last day of the conference, as America was expressing its reservations about even discussing at the UN this issue which affects all countries’ well being, China was once again reiterating that the time had come to begin working on a global reserve currency. 
Since a country’s currency can be a reserve currency only if others are willing to accept it as such, time may be running out for the dollar. 
Emblematic of the difference between the UN and the G-20 conferences was the discussion of bank secrecy: whereas the G-20 focused on tax evasion, the UN Conference addressed corruption, too, which some experts contend gives rise to outflows from some of the poorest countries that are greater than the foreign assistance they receive. 
The US and other advanced industrial countries pushed globalization. 
But this crisis has shown that they have not managed globalization as well as they should have. 
If globalization is to work for everyone, decisions about how to manage it must be made in a democratic and inclusive manner – with the participation of both the perpetrators and the victims of the mistakes. 
The UN, notwithstanding all of its flaws, is the one inclusive international institution. 
This UN conference, like an earlier one on financing for developing countries, demonstrated the key role that the UN must play in any global discussion about reforming the global financial and economic system. 
The Unaccountable G-8 
NEW YORK – In hosting the 2010 G-8 summit of major economies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called for an “accountability summit,” to hold the G-8 responsible for the promises that it made over the years. 
So let’s make our own account of how the G-8 did. 
The answer, alas, is a failing grade. 
The G-8 this year illustrates the difference between photo-ops and serious global governance. 
Of all of the G-8’s promises over the years, the most important was made to the world’s poorest people at the 2005 G-8 Gleneagles Summit in Scotland. 
The G-8 promised that, by this year, it would increase annual development assistance to the world’s poor by $50 billion relative to 2004. 
Half of the increase, or $25 billion per year, would go to Africa. 
The G-8 fell far short of this goal, especially with respect to Africa. 
Total aid went up by around $40 billion rather than $50 billion, and aid to Africa rose by $10-$15 billion per year rather than $25 billion. 
The properly measured shortfall is even greater, because the promises that were made in 2005 should be adjusted for inflation. 
Re-stating those commitments in real terms, total aid should have risen by around $60 billion, and aid to Africa should have risen by around $30 billion. 
In effect, the G-8 fulfilled only half of its promise to Africa – roughly $15 billion in increased aid rather than $30 billion. 
Much of the overall G-8 increase in aid went to Iraq and Afghanistan, as part of the US-led war effort, rather than to Africa. 
Among G-8 countries, only the UK is making a bold effort to increase its overall aid budget and direct a significant portion to Africa. 
Since the G-8 was off track in its aid commitments for many years, I long wondered what the G-8 would say in 2010, when the commitments actually fell due. 
In fact, the G-8 displayed two approaches. 
First, in an “accountability report” issued before the summit, the G-8 stated the 2005 commitments in current dollars rather than in inflation-adjusted dollars, in order to minimize the size of the reported shortfall. 
Second, the G-8 Summit communiqué simply did not mention the unmet commitments at all. 
In other words, the G-8 accountability principle became: if the G-8 fails to meet an important target, stop mentioning the target – a cynical stance, especially at a summit heralded for “accountability.” 
The G-8 did not fail because of the current financial crisis. 
Even before the crisis, the G-8 countries were not taking serious steps to meet their pledges to Africa. 
This year, despite a massive budget crisis, the UK government has heroically honored its aid commitments, showing that other countries could have done so if they had tried. 
But isn’t this what politicians like to do – smile for the cameras, and then fail to honor their promises? 
I would say that the situation is far more serious than that. 
First, the Gleneagles commitments might be mere words to politicians in the rich world, but they are matters of life and death for the world’s poor. 
If Africa had another $15-$20 billion per year in development aid in 2010, as promised, with the amounts rising over future years (also as promised), millions of children would be spared an agonizing death from preventable diseases, and tens of millions of children would be able to get an education. 
Second, the emptiness of G-8 leaders’ words puts the world at risk. 
The G-8 leaders promised last year to fight hunger with $22 billion in new funds, but so far they are not delivering. 
They promised to fight climate change with $30 billion of new emergency funds, but so far they are not delivering. 
My own country, the US, shows the largest gap between promises and reality. 
Hosting this year’s G-8 summit reportedly cost Canada a fortune, despite the absence of any significant results. 
The estimated cost of hosting the G-8 leaders for 1.5 days, followed by the G-20 leaders for 1.5 days, reportedly came to more than $1 billion. 
This is essentially the same amount that the G-8 leaders pledged to give each year to the world’s poorest countries to support maternal and child health. 
It is absurd and troubling to spend $1 billion on three days of meetings under any circumstances (since there are much cheaper ways to have such meetings and much better uses for the money). 
But it is tragic to spend so much money and then accomplish next to nothing in terms of concrete results and honest accountability. 
There are three lessons to be drawn from this sorry episode. 
First, the G-8 as a group should be brought to an end. 
The G-20, which includes developing countries as well as rich countries, should take over. 
Second, any future promises made by the G-20 should be accompanied by a clear and transparent accounting of what each country will do, and when. 
The world needs true accountability, not empty words about accountability. 
Every G-20 promise should spell out the specific actions and commitments of each country, as well as the overall promise of the group. 
Third, the world’s leaders should recognize that commitments to fight poverty, hunger, disease, and climate change are life-and-death issues that require professional management for serious implementation. 
The G-20 meets later this year in South Korea, a country that has emerged from poverty and hunger over the past 50 years. 
South Korea understands the utter seriousness of the global development agenda, and the poorest countries’ needs. 
Our best hope is that South Korea will succeed as the next host country, picking up where Canada has fallen far short. 
The Unbearable Lightness of Change 
MADRID – Barack Obama’s first year in office has been a sobering exercise in the limits of presidential power. 
It also carries lessons about how the resilient and impersonal forces of history can constrain any leader’s drive for change. 
Obama’s current “winter of discontent” genuinely reflects the mixed record of his first year. 
The Massachusetts electoral debacle only highlighted the growing rift between the president’s agenda and popular sensibilities. 
Admittedly, Obama inherited a collapsing financial system, a declining world order, and the ever-present threat of global terrorism. 
In his titanic efforts to stem decline and reform America, Obama has shown vision and talent, but he also learned the hard way that, as Henry Kissinger put it in his memoirs, the pledges of new administrations are almost invariably like “leaves on a turbulent sea.” 
The impossible deadlines, the always ambiguous information the president is fed, and the complex choices that he must make are too frequently bound to clash with political constraints and the resistance to change of both allies and foes. 
The president’s domestic agenda is bold and revolutionary, but it clashes frontally with the most fundamental tenets of America’s liberal and individualistic ethos. 
His health-care reform plan, as the Massachusetts vote demonstrated, is perceived as a personal obsession and an entirely unnecessary distraction from much more urgent and vital concerns, such as the financial crisis and unemployment. 
Obama’s priorities in foreign policy are definitely sound. 
But creating a structure of international relations that will make a more stable and enduring world order is not a task to be completed within one year. 
Nor is it at all certain that the sacrifices required of a country already stretched beyond the limits of its financial capabilities, together with the resistance of world powers, will allow this to be accomplished even in a single presidential term. 
Iraq is showing some positive signs of political and institutional recovery, but the omens for the future remain, in Obama’s own words, “messy.” 
The disintegration of an already fragmented country, the return of civil war, and the shadow of Iran’s power being cast over the Iraqi state are all plausible scenarios. 
A man of peace, Obama has become no less a war president than his predecessor. 
Having seen the harsh realities of the world as it really is , he has become the champion of the “just war.” 
In Afghanistan, he opted for a substantial military surge, but the notion of victory that would allow for a withdrawal of troops remains as foggy and uncertain as it was in the case of Iraq. 
The solution is ultimately political, not military. 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was right to recognize that the Taliban are “part of the political fabric” of Afghanistan and thus “need to participate in the country’s government.” 
But this might not be achieved without involving the major regional stakeholders, including Pakistan, China, and possibly Iran. 
The Obama administration’s failure in re-launching the India-Pakistan peace talks over Kashmir is one of the gravest weaknesses of its “AfPak” strategy. 
If these two countries’ mutual hostility is not reined in, and a fundamentalist Afghanistan continues to provide the strategic depth through which Pakistan threatens its sworn Indian enemies, the current disaster might still breed defeat. 
Obama is right to boast of his success in enlisting China to join serious sanctions on North Korea, but he might be wrong to draw conclusions from this about Iran, a vital strategic partner for the Chinese. 
Likewise, America’s “reset button” policy with Russia has certainly improved relations with the Kremlin, but it remains highly improbable that the Russians would endanger their privileged relations with Iran by joining an economic siege. 
Israel ’s fear that the failure of sanctions might bring the United States to accept coexistence with a nuclear-armed Iran in the way it did with the Soviet Union during the Cold War is not entirely unfounded. 
Obama’s administration will not start a war with a third Muslim country while the two others continue to burn. 
Iran might eventually turn into the graveyard of Obama’s dream of a world without nuclear weapons. 
George Bernard Shaw once observed that “in the arts of peace Man is a bungler.” 
Obama has just admitted that in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, a president can also be one. “This is as intractable a problem as you get,” he admitted after a wasted year of more error than trial. 
He naively ignored the harsh lessons of 20 years of abortive peacemaking, and insisted on sticking to the worn-out paradigm of direct negotiations between parties that, when left to their own devices, are bound to come to a deadlock. 
He was commendably humble to admit that he was wrong “to have raised expectations so high.” 
With no breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli conflict, Obama is left with the epicenter of the Middle East’s maladies seriously undermining his entire strategy in the region. 
Yet he continues to be the greatest promise for a better world that this political generation can offer. 
And he still has time to vindicate Woodrow Wilson’s belief that a “president can be just as big a man as he chooses to be.” 
The Japanese Experiment 
NEWPORT BEACH – After years of tweaks, Japan has now initiated a major shift in its policy paradigm, with reactions ranging from great optimism that the country may finally be lifted out of a quarter-century of economic stagnation, to concerns that the authorities’ dramatic change of course may in fact end up making things worse. 
But, while debate naturally focuses on Japan’s economic, financial, and political maneuvers, the tipping point could well lie abroad. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government has embraced a revolutionary (rather than evolutionary) economic-policy approach that engages several initiatives, some of which were once deemed implausible, unthinkable, or even undesirable. 
From the doubling of the money supply to additional fiscal stimulus and wide-ranging structural reforms, the new policy paradigm is nothing less than one of the boldest economic-policy experiments in Japan’s post-war history. 
To demonstrate their seriousness, Japanese officials moved quickly to commit to measurable metrics. 
On the policy input side, they have specified and begun to implement purchases of securities totaling $75 billion per month (three times as much, in relative terms, as the US Federal Reserve currently purchases under its unconventional monetary-policy regime). 
On the output side, and after many years of persistent deflation (prices fell 0.5% last month), Japan is now targeting a 2% inflation rate within two years, thus underscoring its commitment to avoid a pre-mature withdrawal of monetary support for growth. 
Already, financial markets have responded with alacrity. 
The Japanese equity market is up an impressive 55% since hints of the paradigm shift started hitting investors’ radar screens. 
At the same time, the Japanese yen has depreciated sharply, including by more than 20% against the struggling euro. 
This response is part of the transmission mechanism for the Japanese government’s policies. 
The surge in the stock market benefits domestic investors, making them likelier to spend more (what economists call the “wealth effect”). 
This, in turn, should revive corporate “animal spirits,” leading to higher investment in new plants and equipment, together with higher wages and salaries. 
These are, of course, the same mechanisms that the Fed has targeted for almost three years in its own efforts to stimulate higher growth in the US. 
The macroeconomic outcomes have consistently fallen short of expectations, and there is reason to believe that it will be even more difficult in Japan for monetary policy alone to gain sufficient traction. 
Japan’s aging population mutes the potential impact of both the wealth effect and animal spirits. 
Resource flexibility is lower than in the US. 
Interest rates are already low. 
The experience of deflation is well entrenched. 
And, given Japan’s high level of public indebtedness, the risks of collateral damage and unintended consequences are potentially higher. 
With gross overall government debt already at 238% of GDP, some worry that Japan would face the threat of economic and financial dislocation were a failed policy experiment to lead its private sector – which traditionally has displayed an enormous home bias – to disinvest from Japan. 
This does not mean that Japan’s policy revolution will necessarily disappoint. 
But, critically, it does mean that even if you believe that the BOJ’s actions are necessary for Japan to emerge from its economic malaise, they certainly are not sufficient. 
Japan’s experiment requires meeting two additional conditions if it is to avoid going the way of previous failed policy initiatives: meaningful structural reforms that essentially change how segments of the economy respond and operate; and other countries’ continued acquiescence in the currency depreciation needed to boost the impact of slower-moving domestic dynamics through meaningful gains in global market share. 
Meeting the first condition is in the hands of Japanese citizens and their elected representatives. 
The required reforms, though achievable, will test the government’s resolve and implementation capabilities, as well as the population’s willingness to face immediate disruptions in exchange for the promise of longer-term gains. 
The second requirement is very different. 
It can be achieved only if other countries are willing to sacrifice output, either because they have no choice, or because they believe that, over the medium-term, a stronger Japanese economy will benefit them as the longer-term income effects offset the impact of immediate market disruptions. 
But will the rest of the world accommodate Japan’s bold policy experiment, or will it take protective steps and thus impede the operation of a crucial policy transmission mechanism? 
While initial indications are encouraging, the jury is still out. 
Many affected countries – including those hit by the trade effects (such as China, South Korea, Taiwan, and eurozone members) and those susceptible to the capital-flow channel (such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico) – have not yet had enough time to react. 
Japan’s policy change was big and abrupt, and several of the countries on the receiving end have been focused on complex domestic challenges. 
A few countries – particularly Brazil, China, and South Korea – have noticed. 
But their reactions have been generally muted by Japan’s success in getting a US-led initiative at the G-20 to classify its policy response as constituting the use of “domestic tools” to pursue “domestic objectives.” 
It is just a matter of time until the rest of the world catches up with the reality of how Japan’s experiment affects them. 
The hope is that, bolstered by evidence of Japan’s serious pursuit of structural reforms, they will accommodate the experiment in two ways: by not retaliating, and by undertaking their own domestic reforms that compensate for the output lost to Japan. 
In other words, a growing pie for all better accommodates all. 
The fear is that neither Japan’s subsequent actions nor the affected countries’ domestic realities will justify the risk of lost market share, especially at a time when the global economy as a whole – and global policy coordination – is struggling. 
Here the risk involves currency wars and other beggar-thy-neighbor disruptions. 
There is currently insufficient data to predict either outcome confidently. 
As we await additional evidence, let us appreciate how rarely we witness, in real time, such a momentous policy shift. 
The Undeserving One Percent? 
CHICAGO – It is amazing how the “one percent” epithet, a reference to the top 1% of earners, has caught on in the United States and elsewhere in the developed world. 
In the United States, this 1% includes all those with a 2006 household income of at least $386,000. 
In the popular narrative, the 1% is thickly populated with unscrupulous corporate titans, greedy bankers, and insider-trading hedge-fund managers. 
Reading some progressive economists, it might seem that the answer to all of America’s current problems is to tax the 1% and redistribute to everyone else. 
Of course, underlying this narrative is the view that this income is ill-gotten, made possible by Bush-era tax cuts, the broken corporate governance system, and the conflict-of-interest-ridden financial system. 
The 1% are not people who have earned money the hard way by making real things, so there is no harm in taking it away from them. 
Clearly, this caricature is based on some truth. 
For instance, corporations, especially in the financial sector, reward too many executives richly despite mediocre performance. 
But apart from tarring too many with the same brush, there is something deeply troubling about this narrative’s reductionism. 
It ignores, for example, the fact that many of the truly rich are entrepreneurs. 
It likewise ignores the fact that many of the wealthy are sports stars and entertainers, and that their ranks include professionals such as doctors, lawyers, consultants, and even some of our favorite progressive economists. 
In other words, the rich today are more likely to be working than idle. 
But what might be the most important overlooked fact is that the rise in income inequality is not just at the very top, though it is most pronounced there. 
Academic studies suggest that the top tenth percentile of income distribution in the US, and elsewhere, is also moving farther away from the median earner. 
This is an inconvenient fact for the progressive economist. 
“We are the 90%,” sounds less dramatic than “we are the 99%.” 
And, for some of the protesters, it may not even be true. 
Perhaps most problematic, though, is that something other than plutocrat-friendly policies is largely responsible for the growing inequality. 
That something is education and skills. True, not every degree is a passport to a job. 
Freshly-minted degree holders, especially from lower-quality programs, are finding it particularly hard to get a job nowadays, because they are competing with experienced workers who are also jobless. 
Nevertheless, the unemployment rate for those with degrees is one-third the unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma. 
Close examination suggests that the single biggest difference between those at or above the top tenth percentile of the income distribution and those below the 50th percentile is that the former have a degree or two while the latter, typically, do not. 
Technological change and global competition have made it impossible for American workers to get good jobs without strong skills. 
As Harvard professors Claudia Golden and Larry Katz put it, in the race between technology and education, education is falling behind. 
To acknowledge the fact that the broken educational and skills-building system is responsible for much of the growing inequality that ordinary people experience would, however, detract from the larger populist agenda of rallying the masses against the very rich. 
It has the inconvenient implication that the poor have a role in pulling themselves out of the morass. 
There are no easy and quick fixes to education – every US president since Gerald Ford in the mid-1970’s has called for educational reforms, with little effect. 
In contrast, blaming the undeserving 1% offers a redistributive policy agenda with immediate effects. 
The US has tried quick fixes before. 
Income inequality grew rapidly in the last decade, but consumption inequality did not. 
The reason: easy credit, especially subprime mortgages, which helped those without means to keep up with the Joneses. 
The ending, as everyone knows, was not a happy one. 
The less-well-off ultimately became even worse off as they lost their jobs and homes. 
The US needs to improve the quality of its workforce by developing the skills that are relevant to the jobs that its firms are creating. 
Several steps can be taken towards these goals, including improving community attitudes towards education, reforming schools, tying the curriculum in community colleges and vocational institutions more closely to the needs of local firms, making higher education more affordable, and finding effective ways to retrain unemployed workers. 
None of this is easy or likely to produce results quickly, and some of it may require more resources. 
While eliminating inefficient spending, especially inefficient tax subsidies, can generate some of these funds, more tax revenues may be needed. 
The rich can certainly afford to pay more, but if governments increase taxes on the wealthy, they should do it with the aim of improving opportunities for all, rather than as a punitive measure to rectify an imagined wrong. 
The Unended Recessional 
Zimbabwe's crisis has incited an unsettling feeling of déja vu . 
The reason is clear: it is, thankfully, no longer fashionable to decry colonialism's evils in assigning blame for every national misfortune. 
The imperial statues are toppled, cities and streets renamed, the vestiges of foreign rule either abandoned or adapted. 
With the sole exception of Zimbabwe, no leading politician in any post-imperial country has made a notable speech in recent years attacking colonialism. 
That great staple of political rhetoric appears to have been buried across the developing world. 
Internationally, colonialism is even more passé. 
Once, the votaries of one kind of new international order or another decried the evils of imperialism (sometimes, but not always, prefixed with a ``neo-'') in justifying demands for a more just dispensation. 
That theme has died out in diplomatic discourse. 
Yet followers of world affairs would be unwise to consign colonialism to the proverbial dustbin of history, for it remains a factor in understanding our world's problems and dangers. 
To begin, residual problems from the end of the earlier era of colonization, usually the result of untidy exits by the colonial power, still remain dangerously stalemated. 
The events in East Timor in 1999 remain fresh in memory, and difficulties linger. 
But at least closure seems in sight, unlike those messy legacies of European colonialism: Western Sahara, Cyprus, and Palestine. 
Moreover, fuses lit in the colonial era could re-ignite, as they have done, to everyone's surprise, between Ethiopia and Eritrea, where war broke out over a colonial border that Italy's occupiers had failed to define with precision. 
In Zimbabwe, colonial land ownership patterns that gave most of the viable farmland to white settlers are at least one root of the country's current crisis. 
But not only the direct results of colonialism remain relevant: the indirect ones also matter. 
The intellectual history of colonialism is littered with many a willful cause of recent conflict. 
One is careless anthropology: Belgium's classification of Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi, which reified a distinction that had not existed before, still haunts Africa's Great Lakes region. 
A related problem arises from sociology: how much bloodshed do we owe, for instance, to the British invention of ``martial races'' in India? 
One can never overlook the old colonial administrative habit of ``divide and rule,'' exemplified, again, by British policy in the subcontinent after 1857, which led almost inexorably to the tragedy of Partition. 
Such distinctions were not merely pernicious; they were often characterized by an unequal distribution of the resources of the state within a colonial society. 
Belgian colonialists favored Tutsis, leading to Hutu rejection of them as alien interlopers; 
Sinhalese resentment of Tamil privileges in colonial-era Sri Lanka prompted the discriminatory policies after Independence that fueled the Tamil revolt. 
A ``mixed'' colonial history within one modern state is also a potential source of danger. 
When a state has more than one colonial past, its future is vulnerable. 
Ethnicity or language hardly seem to be a factor in the secessions (one recognized, the other not) of Eritrea from Ethiopia and the ``Republic of Somaliland'' from Somalia. 
Rather, it was different colonial experiences (Italian rule in Eritrea, British rule in Somaliland) that set them off, at least in their own self-perceptions, from the rest of their ethnic compatriots. 
A similar case can be made about the former Yugoslavia, where lands that existed under Austro-Hungarian rule for 800 years were joined to lands that spent almost as long under Ottoman suzerainty. 
The war that erupted in 1991 in no small measure pitted those parts that had been ruled by the German-speaking empires against those that avoided such colonization. 
Boundaries drawn in colonial times, even if unchanged after independence, still create problems, especially in Africa. 
Where colonial constructions force disparate peoples together by the arbitrariness of a colonial map-maker's pen, nationhood becomes elusive. 
Older tribal and clan loyalties in Africa were mangled by the boundaries drawn, in distant cities like Berlin, for colonially-created states whose post-independence leaders needed to invent new traditions and national identities. 
The result was the manufacture of unconvincing political myths, as artificial as the countries they mythologize, which all-too-often cannot command genuine patriotic allegiance from their citizenry. 
State failure in the wake of colonialism is another source of conflict. 
The collapse of effective central governments - manifested in recent years in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Somalia - could unleash a torrent of alarming possibilities because ``weak states,'' particularly in Africa, seem vulnerable to collapsing in a welter of conflict. 
Underdevelopment in post-colonial societies itself causes conflict. 
The uneven development of infrastructure, as a result of priorities skewed to benefit colonialists, can lead to resources being distributed unevenly, which can lead to increasing social fissures. 
Underdevelopment in many countries of the South, which are faring poorly in their struggle to remain viable in a globalizing world, creates conditions of desperate poverty, ecological collapse and rootless, unemployed populations beyond the control of atrophying state systems. 
We will not create a better world in the 21 st century by forgetting what happened in the 19 th and much of the 20 th . 
This is not to say that our responses to the dangers emerging from the legacies of the past must be rooted in the past. 
There is a greater need than ever before for innovative, forward-looking approaches to global governance. 
As we embark upon the still-new millennium, though, it seems ironically clear that tomorrow's possible disorder might be due, in no small part, to yesterday's colonial order. 
I have no wish to give politicians in post-colonial countries whose leadership has been found wanting any reason to find excuses in the past for their own failures. 
But in looking to understand possible future sources of conflict, the best crystal ball may be a rear-view mirror. 
Austerity’s Children 
WASHINGTON, DC – When economists discuss “fiscal adjustment,” they typically frame it as an abstract and complex goal. 
But the issue is actually simple: Who will bear the brunt of measures to reduce the budget deficit? 
Either taxes have to go up for some people, or spending must fall – or both. 
“Fiscal adjustment” is jargon; what austerity is always about is the distribution of income. 
Much of Europe is already aware of this, of course. 
Now it’s America’s turn. 
And current indications there suggest that the people most directly in line for a fiscal squeeze are those who are least able to defend themselves – relatively poor children. 
For example, the current budget sequester (that is, across-the-board spending cuts) is already hurting programs like Head Start, which supports pre-school education. 
The American comedian Jimmy Kimmel recently poked fun at his compatriots’ lack of fiscal knowledge by asking pedestrians on Hollywood Boulevard what they thought of “Obama’s decision to pardon the sequester and send it to Portugal.” 
The segment is hilarious, but also sad, because the impact on some people’s lives is very real. 
Around 70,000 children are likely to lose access to Head Start on our current fiscal course. 
And much larger cuts are in store for early-childhood nutrition programs and health care. 
Perhaps most shocking are the dramatic cuts to the Medicaid health-insurance program that the House of Representatives’ Republican majority have embraced in their latest budget proposal. 
Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, proposes to balance the budget over the next 10 years largely by slashing the program. 
About half of all people covered by Medicaid are children. 
Is it fair to force low-income children to bear the burden of fiscal adjustment? 
According to data available on the economist Emmanuel Saez’s invaluable Web site, from 1993 to 2011, average real income for the bottom 99% of the population (by income) rose by 5.8%, while the top 1% experienced real income growth of 57.5%. 
The top 1% captured 62% of all income growth over this period, partly owing to a sharp rise in returns to higher education in recent decades. 
(On average, those with only a high school education or less have few good income prospects.) 
This implies that, if anything, the tax system should become more progressive, with the proceeds invested in public goods that are not sufficiently provided by the private sector – things like early childhood education and preventive health care to minimize educational disruption resulting from common ailments like childhood asthma. 
Think of it this way: In recent decades, some families chose locations and occupations that seemed to offer a reasonable means of support – and good prospects for their children. 
Many of these decisions turned out badly, largely because information technology (computers and how they are used) eliminated many middle-class jobs. 
Increasing globalization of trade also did not help in this regard. 
In addition, as Till von Wachter of Columbia University has documented, prolonged periods of unemployment for parents have a severe and lasting negative impact on their children. 
Children whose families cannot provide a decent start in life deserve help. 
But America has not provided it – a point recently made by Jeb Bush, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. 
“In our country today,” Bush said in a speech to fellow conservatives, “if you’re born poor, if your parents didn’t go to college, if you don’t know your father, if English isn’t spoken at home, then the odds are stacked against you.” 
Nor is America likely to provide such help in the future, given the coming budget cuts’ disproportionate impact on children at the lower end of the income distribution. 
America can easily afford to do better, of course. 
Its large budget deficits reflect the impact of tax breaks that favor the wealthy and upper middle class; an unfunded expansion of Medicare coverage to include prescription medicines; two foreign wars; and, most important, a banking system that was allowed to get out of control, inflicting massive disruption on the real economy (and thus on tax revenue). 
Today’s children did not play a role in any of these policy mistakes. 
The preschoolers who are about to lose access to Head Start weren’t even born when they were made. 
Imposing austerity on poor children is not just unfair; it is also bad economics. 
When economists, again with their dry jargon, talk about a country’s “human capital,” what they really mean is the cognitive and physical abilities of its people. 
As I pointed out in recent Congressional testimony, poor education leads to poor job prospects, poor families, and back to poor education – if not with a detour through incarceration, which makes it even harder to break the cycle. 
Unfortunately, no one in a position of power is likely to heed such arguments. 
They should. 
When you travel to a foreign country for the first time, and you see neglected, ill-fed, and uneducated children, do you regard that country as likely to be one of the world’s great economic powers over the next half-century? 
The Unfinished Cold War 
MOSCOW – This November will mark the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
But the end of confrontation in Europe may be proving only temporary. 
One year after last summer’s war in Georgia, old divisions seem to be re-emerging in a different form. 
Although the Cold War in Europe was declared over, the truth is, it never really finished. 
When the Soviet Union withdrew from Central and Eastern Europe, we Russians believed that NATO would not be extended to the countries and territories from which we had withdrawn. 
Our hope was for unification with Europe, a “common European home,” and the creation of a Europe “united and free.” 
Our hopes were not starry-eyed self-deception. 
After all, the leaders of the United States and Germany had promised Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand eastward. 
At first, after they had vanquished communism, Russians regarded themselves as victors. 
But, after a few euphoric years, the West began acting more and more like the Cold War’s winners. 
Once the potential “military threat” posed by the Soviet Union had vanished into thin air, successive waves of NATO enlargement served neither a military nor an ideological purpose. 
The West’s logic for enlargement was geopolitical: to bring the former Soviet republics and socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe into the Western sphere of political and economic influence. 
At first, NATO’s new members were declared to have met both democratic and military criteria. 
Later, these criteria were abandoned when NATO began to invite even the most backward and corrupt states to join. 
NATO, moreover, not only enlarged its membership, but also transformed itself from an anti-Communist defensive alliance into an offensive grouping (with operations in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan). 
NATO’s expansion towards Russia’s own borders, and the membership of countries whose elites have historical complexes in regard to Russia, increased anti-Russian sentiment inside the alliance. 
For all its efforts to improve its image, many Russians now view NATO as a much more hostile organization than they did in the 1990’s, or even before then. 
Moreover, NATO enlargement has meant that Europe itself has still not emerged from the Cold War. 
No peace treaty ended the Cold War, so it remains unfinished. 
Even though the ideological and military confrontation of those times is far behind us, it is being replaced with a new stand-off – between Russia, on one hand, and the US and some of the “New Europeans” on the other. 
My hope is that, when historians look back at Georgia’s attack on South Ossetia of last summer, the Ossetians, Russians, and Georgians killed in that war will be seen as having not died in vain. 
Russian troops crushed Georgia’s army on the ground, but they also delivered a strong blow against the logic of further NATO expansion, which, if not stopped, would have inevitably incited a major war in the heart of Europe. 
For the time being, the situation remains open. 
The US failed to unleash some new form of Cold War after the South Ossetian episode, not least because of the global financial and economic crisis. 
It is my hope that the global economic crisis and Barack Obama’s presidency will put the farcical idea of a new Cold War into proper perspective. 
Greater Europe, in which I include not only Russia, but also the US, needs a new peace treaty, or rather system of accords, that draw a line under Europe’s horrible twentieth century and thus prevent a historical relapse. 
What is needed is a new pan-European treaty on collective security, signed either by individual countries or by NATO and the EU, as well as by Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
Countries not included in any of the current security systems would be able to join in the treaty and receive multilateral guarantees. 
NATO enlargement would de facto be frozen. 
With the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in mind, we must seek to prevent the further fragmentation of states, and also their forcible reunification. 
Kosovo, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia must be the last of the states that break away through force. 
The “Pandora’s box” of self-determination must be closed. 
Once the legacy of confrontation inherited from the twentieth century has been overcome, perhaps deep cuts in the Russia and US nuclear arsenals may become possible, together with coordination of military-strategic policies. 
In this scenario, Russian-US cooperation in crisis situations like Afghanistan, or in countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, would become much more profound. 
In Europe proper, a union between Russia and the EU should be founded, based on a common economic space, a common energy space – with cross-ownership of companies that produce, transport, and distribute energy – and a common human space that would be visa-free and include coordinated Russian and EU international policies. 
Emphasis should also be placed on establishing a new system for governing the global economy and finance, whose creation will be even more difficult if the confrontations of the Cold War are not resolved. 
Europe, Russia, and the US must finish the “unfinished war.” 
Then, perhaps in 2019, the year that will mark the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, we may finally bid farewell to the twentieth century. 
DNA at 60 
LONDON – On April 25, 1953, Francis Crick and James Watson published a one-page paper that many believed would revolutionize biological research. 
Building on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, they had discovered DNA’s double-helix structure, providing the first glimpse into how organisms inherit and store biological information. 
But, 60 years later, has their discovery really had the transformative impact that the world expected? 
The media marked the publication’s 60th anniversary with much fanfare, hailing the breakthrough that “ushered in the age of genetics,” and calling it “one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time.” 
The British newspaper The Guardian featured the headline, “Happy Birthday, DNA! 
The golden moment that changed us all.” 
To some extent, they are right. 
The finding forms the basis of genetics and has opened up promising new research areas, such as synthetic biology, in which biological systems are created or modified to perform specific functions. 
Likewise, it has facilitated important innovations, such as pharmacogenetic cancer treatment, in which drugs target specific genetic defects within cancer cells. 
Moreover, DNA has acquired a certain mystique in popular culture. 
According to Dorothy Nelkin and Susan Lindee, it has become a sacred entity – the modern equivalent of the Christian soul, an individual’s essence. 
While some forms of biological determinism, such as the belief that race or gender dictates a person’s destiny, have been widely rejected, the idea that a person can be genetically predisposed, say, to get into debt, become a ruthless dictator, or vote regularly in elections remains socially acceptable. 
But, almost from the beginning – and most intensely since 1971, when Time magazine published a special section entitled “The New Genetics: Man into Superman” – science and society alike have tended to overestimate the impact of genetics. 
When the Human Genome Project published the first draft of the fully sequenced human genome in 2000, Henry Gee, an editor of the journal Nature, predicted that scientists would be able “to alter entire organisms out of all recognition to suit our needs and tastes” by 2099. 
“We will have extra limbs, if we want them,” he asserted, “maybe even wings to fly.” 
Thirteen years later, Gee’s prediction looks increasingly unlikely, with the Human Genome Project so far having failed to meet expectations. 
Indeed, in 2010, the science writer Nicholas Wade lamented that, a decade after the project was launched, geneticists were “almost back to square one in knowing where to look for the roots of common disease.” 
For example, a 12-year study of 19,000 white American women found that 101 genetic markers that had been statistically linked to heart disease had no predictive value. 
Self-reported family histories, by contrast, proved very accurate in predicting the disease. 
In fact, most diseases are not caused by single genes. 
As a result, after a few early successes with atypical single-gene disorders such as Huntington’s disease, progress has stalled. 
Common variants typically explain a small fraction of genetic risk. 
Genetics has been a source of particularly high hopes when it comes to cancer treatment. 
Between 1962 and 1985, cancer-related deaths in the United States rose by 8.7%, despite the use of aggressive chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy, highlighting the dangers of a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment. 
An understanding of the genetic determinants of patients’ therapeutic response, it was believed, would enable doctors to develop individualized treatment programs, sparing more responsive patients from harmful overtreatment. 
But patients are not the only variable. 
Cancer, too, is heterogeneous, even in patients with the same diagnosis. 
After sequencing the entire genomes of 50 patients’ breast cancer tumors, researchers found that only 10% of the tumors had more than three mutations in common. 
According to a recent study mapping genetic mutations in 2,000 tumors, breast cancer can actually be divided into ten subgroups. 
Similarly, a genome-wide analysis of malignant cells from four kidney-cancer patients showed that, while they were related, they had mutated in many different directions. 
Two-thirds of the genetic faults identified were not repeated in the same tumor, let alone in any other metastasized tumors in the body. 
Given that a pharmacogenetic drug targets one mutation in the tumor, it will not necessarily work on the other mutations. 
In addition, as the cancer adjusts to the drug, further mutations are likely to occur, diminishing the drug’s efficacy. 
To be sure, pharmacogenetics has made a profound difference for some patients. 
Barbara Bradfield, one of the original subjects in research trials for the pharmacogenetic cancer drug Herceptin, has now been stable on the drug for more than 20 years. 
But such success stories are far too rare to constitute a “golden age” of genetics. 
The high price of such drugs is limiting their impact as well. 
Herceptin can cost up to $40,000 annually, and newer cancer drugs cost even more, making them prohibitively expensive for most patients. 
The US Supreme Court is currently faced with the question of whether genes can be patented. 
If the court upholds the biotechnology company Myriad Genetics’ patents on two genes which, in some variants, are linked to higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer, the company will retain exclusive rights to use the genes in research, diagnosis, and treatment for two decades, preventing rivals from developing cheaper alternatives. 
Women have already been denied access to a diagnostic test, because insurers refuse to pay the company’s high prices. 
Manufacturers claim that gene patents, which now cover 25-40% of the human genome, are vital to recouping their investments. 
But such patents mar DNA’s “birthday” celebrations for the patients who stand to benefit from the fruits of genetic research – if only they could afford them. 
The Ungreening of the World 
Everyone I meet claims to love trees -- I mean really love trees -- yet collectively the human race behaves as if it abhors green things. 
If you take a step back from whatever biome you are in at the moment and look at the entire Earth and its forests through recorded history, you will see that the relationship between humans and trees looks Strangely Like War (the title of a recent book on forests by Derrick Jensen and George Draffan). 
The exact extent of the damage is difficult to discern, because for many years records were not kept, but the estimates are that 75% of the world’s original forests have been logged or burned by humans. 
Some of them have grown back of course, or have been replanted, but it is thought that we now have only half of the amount of forest land we once had on this planet. 
In some places, particularly the drier places of the globe, the deforestation was so severe, and was followed by such intense grazing, that forests have not been able to grow back. 
The landscape has been permanently altered. 
When you imagine Greece, Italy, and Iraq, it is likely that you imagine a dry landscape with open views, the way they look today. 
Historical records indicate, however, that these places were once covered by dense forests. 
The forests fell as civilizations flourished, so the earlier a place became “civilized” the sooner it became deforested. 
This march of so-called progress resulting in the loss of forests was documented by John Perlin in his 1989 book A Forest Journey . 
So today we sit on a planet with only 50% of its forest cover remaining. 
And here’s the part that should bring tears to your eyes: we continue to lose more forest cover every year. 
The more recent losses are well documented. 
Every five years the United Nations produces a summary report called the Global Forest Resource Assessment; 
The team in charge of assembling the assessment relies on internet reporting and satellite surveillance to come up with the figures. 
According to the most recent report, between 2000 and 2005, we lost forest acreage equivalent to the land mass of Panama -- more than 77 thousand square kilometers of forest gone, some of it never to return. 
The next report is due to be released in 2010. 
I will not be surprised when it is released and I read that the global forest area has continued to shrink. 
If this happens when we claim to love trees, I shudder to think what would happen if we were ambivalent about them? 
Or thought we could live without them? 
In the United States, deforestation began as soon as the colonies were settled. 
Before long, the colonies were exporting wood to the many nations that no longer had the timber they needed for ships, casks, shingles, and other construction materials. 
Trees were also cut to clear cropland, provide heat, and the fledgling nation was using up its forests to build its own ironworks and railroads as well. 
By 1920, more than three-quarters of the US’s original forests had been cut. 
Similar to the global figures, today the US has only half the forest cover that it had in 1600. 
And we continue to destroy forest land. 
At the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro it was agreed that, “efforts should be undertaken towards the greening of the world.” 
The UN recognizes that “forests are essential to economic development and all forms of life.” But the UN Charter also reads: “states have the sovereign right to exploit their own resources.” 
Although the UN and my country recognize the value of forests, both ecologically and economically, such recommendations are not strong enough to stop my local council from voting “yes” to deforestation. 
Last week, I went to a zoning meeting in the town where I live. 
A real estate housing project developer wanted to cut many acres of trees so he could build houses. 
That forest land will be lost, probably forever, and a few more numbers will be added to the global deforestation total next year. 
Why do local politicians, tree lovers all, allow yet more forest destruction? 
Why do humans all claim to love trees, but their actions deny their claim? 
I think it has to do with fear. 
When a would-be exploiter of trees stands before a politician and requests, or demands, the right to clear a forest, the politician, out of fear, complies. 
But we do not fear trees. 
We do not fear their retaliation. 
Trees stand mute despite our betrayal. 
Perhaps that is one of the reasons we really love them. 
But if we want to do more than love them, if we want to save them, we must become fearless. 
The Unilateral Road to Peace 
In the next three weeks, the Israeli army will do something unprecedented: instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorism, it will evacuate – by force if necessary – 9,000 Israelis from their homes. 
Israel’s unilateral withdrawal is the outcome of a deep political shift that has been caused by two somewhat contradictory convictions that have characterized Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s policies since 2003: first, that the US-initiated “road map” is going nowhere and, second, that the status quo is untenable. 
Certainly, according to Sharon’s thinking, there is no future for 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. 
Hence, in the absence of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only meaningful step towards de-escalation and stabilization. 
This policy has deeply divided Israel: the settlers – mostly, but not exclusively religious – feel betrayed by Sharon, “The Father of the Settlements.” 
It is now the Israeli left that, however reluctantly, realizes that Sharon’s new pragmatism may be the first step in the right direction. 
Like de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has reshuffled the cards of Israel’s politics. 
The last weeks have seen massive demonstrations, some of them verging on violence; many of the settlers have declared that they will not obey government orders to evacuate. 
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions. 
This forcible approach is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis. 
Only the next days and weeks will tell whether the evacuation proceeds peacefully or not. 
In the meantime, Sharon has paid heavily for his policies. 
Two right-wing parties have left his ruling coalition, he has lost his majority within his own Likud Party, and his finance minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has quit his government. 
Only by bringing Shimon Peres’s Labor Party into his cabinet did Sharon manage to retain his parliamentary majority. 
The question, of course, is what will happen after the Gaza disengagement. 
Many governments were initially skeptical about disengagement, but realized that – as the Washington saying goes – “this is the only game in town.” Among them, as well as among the Palestinians, one hears the hope that after the Gaza withdrawal, it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations leading to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
This is a major mistake. 
While motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality. 
Future negotiations will have to deal with the ultimate borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, and with the problem of the 1947-48 Palestinian refugees. 
On all of these issues, the gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions has not narrowed since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000, while fear and distrust have increased. 
To attempt negotiations under these circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility, but may merely deepen alienation and suspicion on both sides. 
The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough – and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians. 
So what can be done? 
Probably the only rational way to proceed would be to acknowledge that unilateral steps on both sides can still further the cause of de-escalation and ultimate reconciliation. 
On the Israeli side, further disengagement from dozens of isolated and small settlements on the West Bank, entailing the evacuation of between 20,000 and 30,000 settlers, may be politically feasible and would give the Palestinians a contiguous territory on the West Bank. 
On the Palestinian side, consolidation of the Palestinian Authority’s control over a dozen security services and militias would be an important step. 
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, recognizes this, but the question is whether he can deliver. 
The Palestinian leadership could also start down the difficult road of telling the refugees that – contrary to almost 50 years of Palestinian propaganda – they will not return to Israel, but will have to be settled in the West Bank and Gaza, the areas that will become part of the eventual Palestinian state. 
In an ideal world, conflicts end by agreements and treaties. 
But in the real world – and Cyprus, Bosnia, and Kosovo may be examples – stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end, even without formal agreement. 
In the absence of plausible alternatives, one hopes that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians. 
The Union and the Dragon 
This month, China and the European Union mark 30 years of official relations. 
During that period, changes within China, and in the nature of those relations, have been dramatic. 
But how will relations evolve over the next thirty years? 
Will China and the EU be competitors or partners? 
Many challenges face both China and the EU. 
The first are economic. 
China’s development in recent years has been magnificent. 
But speedy growth always incites turbulence, which China will have to minimize and manage. 
As it integrates into the world economy, it must seek to sustain growth while protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality. 
These are daunting tasks, and China cannot address them alone. 
Indeed, sustainable development is a challenge for both China and Europe. 
After all, by far the most important factor determining whether our children and grandchildren will enjoy secure, healthy, and productive lives is whether the world’s natural ecosystems survive the pressures put on them by modern civilization. 
A recent UN report warned that we have already entered the danger zone. 
Numerous land and sea ecosystems are in danger of being destroyed forever, with effects that are hard to predict. 
One downside to China’s rapid growth is its rising demand for energy and the increased CO2 emissions that accompany it. 
China is quickly turning into one of the world’s largest importers of oil and gas. 
The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2004 predicts that, between now and 2030, global demand for energy will rise by roughly 60%, with China and India accounting for nearly two-thirds of that increase. 
Huge investments – worth trillions of euros – will be needed to meet global energy requirements. 
The same report warns that, if we do not change our ways, worldwide CO2 emissions will rise exponentially. 
So a new phase in international environmental cooperation is needed, with China’s active contribution. 
Of course, China clearly has a right – like any country – to seek the energy, minerals, and other resources it needs. 
But a lack of cooperation could result in higher-than-necessary oil and gas prices and perhaps defeat in the battle against climate change. 
This means that China must treat climate change and intelligent energy use as priorities in its national policies. 
Beyond economics, China must reassure others that its awakening will not make the world tremble. 
Thus, in formulating its policies, China must also sell those policies to a global audience. 
Most Europeans believe that China wants to be a shaper of – not a challenger to – a balanced world order, a strong United Nations, and an effective multilateral system. 
But, in a global village, misperceptions can arise all too easily – and can do great damage. 
China’s important role concerning North Korea’s nuclear ambitions is a good example of exercising responsibility for international security and stability. 
The international community counts on China to pursue that role with vigor. 
If necessary, it must use its influence even more assertively to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table. 
Obviously, that solution must be in line with Chinese proposals and interests: a denuclearized Korean peninsula, which has the support of the EU. 
Opportunities exist for a constructive Chinese role elsewhere. 
Having concluded a ten-year energy agreement with Iran, China is in a position to support the EU’s efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation, as the Union supports China’s efforts concerning North Korea. 
This is not just about Iran, but also about the threat of a nuclear arms race across the entire Middle East. 
Chinese interests are served by a Middle East marked by regional cooperation. 
We count on China’s continued support for European and American efforts in making sure that Iran’s nuclear program remains limited to purely civilian purposes. 
Europe and the world are also watching China’s handling of domestic human rights issues. 
The EU welcomed the inclusion last year of the following clause in the Chinese Constitution: “The government respects and protects the human rights of the people.” 
But it is deeds that matter. 
At the EU-China Summit, we discussed the Chinese government’s plans for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
One subject China should address is freedom of belief. 
The obligation of prior registration of religious communities is discriminatory. 
Ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – and the resulting changes in Chinese laws and practice – would help to secure social and political stability in China, boost dialogue between China and the EU, and increase China’s moral authority. 
It is time to replace the old cooperation agreement between the Union and China, dating from 1985. 
Our relationship has evolved from a predominantly economic one into one that includes fighting terrorism, piracy, and organized crime, as well as many other issues. 
A structured dialogue – including the private sector, which is so intimately involved in China’s development – is needed on energy, sustainable development, and the environment. 
We must see environmental problems and energy scarcity for what they are: threats to mankind as a whole. 
China will undoubtedly find the EU a tough negotiating partner. 
The EU sets all kinds of conditions for cooperation with other countries. 
Some issues are non-negotiable, because they are pillars of the European model that we seek to share with the world. 
These include democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and the environment, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and the campaign against terrorism. 
The EU’s political standards are high, but the fruits of cooperation are sweet. 
If we tackle our common problems together, China and Europe can be instrumental in turning the twenty-first century into a century of hope. 
The United States and the Test Ban Treaty 
Two weeks before President George W. Bush takes office, the uncertainty that surrounded his election has been replaced by concerns about the impact his presidency will have on America’s foreign policy. 
America’s allies and adversaries alike are looking for evidence of continuity or change in the new president’s approach. 
One key test will be the new administration’s actions on nuclear nonproliferation in general and on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in particular. 
A year ago, President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright asked me to serve as their Special Advisor for the Test Ban Treaty. 
The US Senate had recently voted against the Treaty’s ratification. 
I was asked to conduct a quiet, low-key dialogue with Senators in order to sort out the complex issues in the debate and think about what should be done. 
To this end, I met with Democratic and Republican Senators and consulted with senior administration representatives, laboratory officials, scientists and other experts with widely disparate views on ratification. 
I listened to their concerns and sought their suggestions. 
My consultations assured me that there is broad bipartisan support within the US for strengthening American leadership of a comprehensive international response to the dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
I am more convinced than ever that the Test Ban Treaty is an integral – even indispensable – component of global nonproliferation efforts. 
I hope that the Bush administration will revisit the Treaty in the context of its importance to combating the spread of nuclear weapons. 
This week, I submitted to President Clinton a series of recommendations that may help the incoming administration give favorable consideration to revisiting the Treaty. 
These recommendations focus on four principal concerns raised by Treaty opponents: questions about its value to the non-proliferation regime; the potential for cheating; its impact on the US nuclear deterrent; and the uncertainties associated with the Treaty’s indefinite duration. 
Although too numerous to list here, the broad objectives of these recommendations are to: 
· Increase bipartisan and allied support for a carefully coordinated comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation program; 
· Enhance US capabilities to detect and deter nuclear testing and other aspects of nuclear proliferation; 
· Improve the management of potential risks associated with the long-term reliability and safety of the US nuclear deterrent; 
· Address concerns about the Test Ban Treaty’s indefinite duration through a joint legislative-executive review of its net value for national security ten years after US ratification and at regular intervals thereafter. 
America recognizes that it has a deep responsibility to join with like-minded nations in leading global nonproliferation efforts. 
US leadership is essential to the success here, as is the Test Ban Treaty. 
Banning nuclear tests contributes to an effective nonproliferation policy predicated on the skillful use of a variety of political, diplomatic and economic responses to proliferation problems. 
It helps to constrain further development and proliferation of advanced nuclear weapons and strengthens political support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
It will make it easier for America and its friends to mobilize international support for other important nonproliferation measures, including tighter export controls and strengthened safeguards on civilian nuclear programs if the US were part of the Test Ban Treaty regime. 
The spread of nuclear weapons is unquestionably among the greatest threats to global security. 
Now more than ever, proliferation threatens to heighten regional tensions and multiply devastation should war break out. 
One need look no further than the Middle East or South Asia to see the potential for catastrophe. 
If unthinkable disasters in these and other regions are to be averted, America must exercise clear and consistent leadership to sustain global support for nonproliferation efforts. 
Around the world, some viewed the Senate vote against the Test Ban Treaty as a sign that the US might be walking away from its traditional leadership. 
I am confident that this is not the case. 
The Senate and the Clinton administration have demonstrated their support for nuclear test restraints by maintaining the US moratorium on nuclear testing begun under President Bush in 1992 and by continuing to fund and participate in efforts to complete the Treaty’s verification regime. 
These efforts should be continued by the incoming administration. 
Ultimately, this will not be enough. 
The global community’s initial reaction to the Senate vote was muted somewhat by signs that the administration and key senators wanted to build bipartisan support for eventual reconsideration of the Treaty. 
Other nations will, of course, afford the new administration time to review these issues. 
But they will soon want to see concrete signs of progress toward ratification. 
Extended delay is unlikely to be met with extended tolerance. 
If other states perceive a definite end to hopes of American ratification of the Treaty, the damage to the nonproliferation regime, over time, could be immeasurable. 
Whether this can be averted depends in part on whether the Bush administration decides to pursue a bipartisan and deliberate reconsideration of the Treaty by the Senate and whether the Treaty will be viewed in isolation or within the context of a comprehensive nonproliferation strategy. 
Ratification should not be expected to happen quickly, as the Bush administration and the Senate will need to become convinced that the benefits of the Treaty’s impact on nonproliferation outweigh the potential risks. 
I am confident that the recommendations included in my report set forth a balanced, responsible approach to mitigating these risks without renegotiating the Treaty. 
I hope that the new administration and Congress will consider implementing my recommendations at the earliest date possible as a means of facilitating a bipartisan approach to nonproliferation while reassuring the international community of America’s continued leadership in this area. 
The Universe in a Grain of Sand 
There was a flurry of press coverage when the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland was turned on, and again when it was shut down by a technical problem shortly afterwards. 
The collider’s operation was a much-anticipated event in science, one that could confirm or undermine one of the most successful theories about how the universe is structured. 
The public attention that it has received is rare for scientific news, perhaps owing to concerns that something celestially dangerous is being cooked up in our backyard. 
The lead-up coverage was accompanied by hype about the potential risks, so when the test did not seem to go as planned, it was natural to wonder if the fabric of space-time had been bruised. 
Some of the initial rumors about what could happen were extreme. 
One speculated that these new high energies, when combined with the specific way the particles would be broken, would annihilate us. 
In another scenario, the lab might create uncontrollable tiny black holes. 
In yet another, the creation of a “stranglet” would spawn new and terrible levels of nuclear power. 
There are possible risks when messing around with fundamental matter, but in this case, the shutdown was due to a mundane gas leak. 
What makes this test interesting for scientists, rather than newsmakers, is unchanged, and will still be exciting when CERN starts up the collider again. 
Here is what is at stake. 
For a scientific theory to be accepted, it must 1) explain observable phenomena; 2) be “elegant” in the sense that its truth and clarity are obvious; and 3) predict what will happen when you do something you have never done before. 
The purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to create an unprecedented situation. 
If the predicted particle does not appear, a series of theoretical abstractions will be questioned – and become open to replacement by radically different alternatives. 
It is not generally appreciated how much real-world impact a changed scientific model can have. 
For most people, the topics that excite physicists do not seem to affect daily life in the slightest. 
But there is a deeper chain of abstractions – the tools we use to think – at work here, one based on the way we perceive reality. 
For example, consider how different the world was before the concept of “zero” was discovered. 
Zero is essential to bookkeeping and hence all modern commerce. 
And that is quite apart from the way we take for granted the idea of “nothing.” 
The concept simply did not exist in the west until the Catholic Church ended its prohibition on the notion in the twelfth century, 1400 years after zero had been invented in the Arab World. 
Similarly, what if theories using germs had not been proven? 
We wouldn’t think about information transfer or messages the same way. 
Or the concept of the force field, which enables the concept of influence? 
Freud’s original model of the mind, the successors of which since shaped how we think of ourselves, were inspired by Einstein’s theory of relativity. 
Powerful scientific abstractions eventually creep into the way we enjoy art, and how we form our laws and articulate our ethics. 
In the highly anticipated CERN experiment, the theory in question is at the center of a controversy about what abstractions seem more fundamental in the universe. 
One is based on number; the other is based on form. 
The first holds that the universe is fundamentally probabilistic, generally random but with an order to its randomness. 
The other posits that the universe is inherently geometric, and that geometric properties, such as symmetry, govern it. 
If the experiment finds the predicted particle, it will tilt the argument toward form. 
Here’s what this could mean in the long run. 
When you just read the word “symmetry,” you probably thought about two balanced halves, or a reflection. 
We extend this simple notion through all of our reasoning about the world: man and woman, boss and employee, love and hate, left and right. 
It drives our ideas of politics, religion, and even the principles of truth underpinning our system of laws. 
But what if you naturally dealt with symmetries of three? 
What if it was proven, through a particle collision, that a true balance required three sides instead of two? 
The tests in the Hadron Collider may trigger this change, every bit as disruptive as an explosion. 
Or perhaps it will be less dramatic, dawning in the mind of a clerk gazing out the window of a patent office. 
A different perception of reality has the power to change us – change the way we think – and it could come from anywhere. 
The Unknown Promise of Internet Freedom 
MELBOURNE – Google has withdrawn from China, arguing that it is no longer willing to design its search engine to block information that the Chinese government does not wish its citizens to have. 
In liberal democracies around the world, this decision has generally been greeted with enthusiasm. 
But in one of those liberal democracies, Australia, the government recently said that it would legislate to block access to some Web sites. 
The prohibited material includes child pornography, bestiality, incest, graphic “high impact” images of violence, anything promoting or providing instruction on crime or violence, detailed descriptions of the use of proscribed drugs, and how-to information on suicide by Web sites supporting the right to die for the terminally or incurably ill. 
A readers’ poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed 96% opposed to those proposed measures, and only 2% in support. 
More readers voted in this poll than in any previous poll shown on the newspaper’s Web site, and the result is the most one-sided. 
The Internet, like the steam engine, is a technological breakthrough that changed the world. 
Today, if you have an Internet connection, you have at your fingertips an amount of information previously available only to those with access to the world’s greatest libraries – indeed, in most respects what is available through the Internet dwarfs those libraries, and it is incomparably easier to find what you need. 
Remarkably, this came about with no central planning, no governing body, and no overall control, other than a system for allocating the names of Web sites and their addresses. 
That something so significant could spring up independently of governments and big business led many to believe that the Internet can bring the world a new type of freedom. 
It is as if an inherently decentralized and individualist technology had realized an anarchist vision that would have seemed utterly utopian if dreamed up by Peter Kropotkin in the nineteenth century. 
That may be why so many people believe so strongly that the Internet should be left completely unfettered. 
Perhaps because Google has been all about making information more widely available, its collaboration with China’s official Internet censors has been seen as a deep betrayal. 
The hope of Internet anarchists was that repressive governments would have only two options: accept the Internet with its limitless possibilities of spreading information, or restrict Internet access to the ruling elite and turn your back on the twenty-first century, as North Korea has done. 
Reality is more complex. 
The Chinese government was never going to cave in to Google’s demand that it abandon Internet censorship. 
The authorities will no doubt find ways of replacing the services that Google provided – at some cost, and maybe with some loss of efficiency, but the Internet will remain fettered in China. 
Nevertheless, the more important point is that Google is no longer lending its imprimatur to political censorship. 
Predictably, some accuse Google of seeking to impose its own values on a foreign culture. 
Nonsense. 
Google is entitled to choose how and with whom it does business. 
One could just as easily assert that during the period in which Google filtered its results in China, China was imposing its values on Google. 
Google’s withdrawal is a decision in accordance with its own values. 
In my view, those values are more defensible than the values that lead to political censorship – and who knows how many Chinese would endorse the value of open access to information, too, if they had the chance? 
Even with censorship, the Internet is a force for change. 
Last month, when the governor of China’s Hubei province threatened a journalist and grabbed her recorder after she asked a question about a local scandal, journalists, lawyers, and academics used the Internet to object. 
A Web report critical of the governor’s behavior stayed up for 18 hours before censors ordered it taken down. 
By then, however, the news was already widely dispersed. 
Likewise, in Cuba, Yoani Sánchez’s blog Generation Yhas broken barriers that conventional media could not. 
Although the Cuban government has blocked access to the Web site on which the blog is posted, it is available around the world in many languages, and distributed within Cuba on compact disks and flash drives. 
The new freedom of expression brought by the Internet goes far beyond politics. 
People relate to each other in new ways, posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception. 
We discover new things about what people want to do and how they want to connect to each other. 
Do you live in an isolated village and have unusual hobbies, special interests, or sexual preferences? 
You will find someone online with whom to share them. 
Can’t get to a doctor? 
You can check your symptoms online – but can you be sure that the medical Web site you are using is reliable? 
Technology can be used for good or for bad, and it is too soon to reach a verdict on the Internet. 
The Unraveling of Europe’s Peace 
COPENHAGEN – The European Commission recently unveiled long-awaited measures to bring neighboring countries in the Mediterranean and the former Soviet Union closer to Europe. 
On the same day, another department of the same Commission presented proposals aimed at curbing visa-waiver programs for some non-European nationals. 
Few missed the irony of formulating two plans that pointed in opposite directions. 
Attracting neighbors has long been a noble aspiration – and something of a European specialty. 
The European Union’s embrace of post-communist republics in Central Europe represented a most powerful symbol of the reach of Western liberal democracy. 
In today’s neighborhood, where EU expansion is not in the cards, Europe hopes to shore up its presence by opening its huge internal market and increasing assistance. 
Crucially, the Commission’s recent proposals include the creation of “mobility partnerships” with Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, aimed at facilitating travel for local students and businesspeople. 
By contrast, the proposed restrictions on the visa-waiver program include “safeguard clauses” that would temporarily suspend access to Europe’s Schengen area, most likely for those from Balkan countries. 
This is controversial enough: the decision is motivated by a large influx of asylum-seekers, often offering frivolous reasons, originating from Serbia. 
But visa liberalization has been the main concrete signal of Europe’s goodwill towards this neglected backyard, which dreams of joining the EU. 
Whatever this plan’s impact in practice, the political message is clear: when in doubt, Europe is better off sealing its borders. 
The same Janus-faced approach is evident in Europe’s response to the Arab Spring. 
After a lukewarm reaction to the uprisings, Europe was eager to show its support for democratic movements in the region. 
At the same time, with boatloads of migrants arriving from Tunisia, some rather drastic measures have been adopted. 
A recent dispute between Italy (the main port of arrival) and France (the principal final destination) ended with the French reintroducing border controls. 
In an unrelated move, Denmark did the same, ostensibly to prevent cross-border crime. 
To its credit, the European Commission also issued strong calls to member states for better legislation and practices concerning migration. 
But there is a clear correlation between unrest at the EU’s doorstep and Europe’s irresistible instinct to keep trouble at arm’s length. 
For once, the rot is not in Brussels, but rather in a growing number of European capitals. 
The case of Italy is instructive: “human tsunami” is the unfortunate phrase used by senior policymakers to warn against the possible flood of migrants. 
But, almost six months into the North African upheavals, the number of arrivals on the southern island of Lampedusa has reached roughly 30,000. 
By comparison, Sweden, with one-sixth the population of Italy, accepted the same number of asylum-seekers in 2009. 
Italian officials privately confirm that the current figures are not unmanageable. 
The problem for Italian officials, as for the other governments concerned by the recent migration flows, is the pressure of right-wing populist parties, which no longer need to be on the defensive. 
The case for openness, inclusion, and diversity in European societies has become much harder to make. 
Not coincidentally, mainstream leaders, from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to British Prime Minister David Cameron, have caught up with the current mood by deeming European multiculturalism a failure. 
This turn of events comes at a price. 
The genius of modern Europe has consisted in linking long-term stability to the pursuit of ever-deeper economic and political integration. 
For the past half-century, this has represented Europe’s revolutionary recipe for peace, and has served as something of a microcosm of globalization. 
The ever-freer and faster flow of capital, labor, goods, and ideas found in the EU a model and a forerunner. 
Free movement of people within Europe constitutes this visionary project’s most tangible feat. 
One unintended effect of the Arab revolutions is that the link between security and integration that forms Europe’s foundation is decoupling. 
The advantages of pooling sovereignty and resources ring increasingly hollow to ordinary Europeans. 
Governments find it more politically rewarding to pursue security by erecting administrative or physical barriers. 
As election campaigns beckon in some of the countries that are now debating immigration controls, this trend is unlikely to be reversed any time soon. 
But Europeans should make no mistake about the consequences. 
Opposing Europe now means not only standing up to an unelected behemoth in Brussels, as Euro-skeptics would have it. 
Nor is it merely about questioning the sources of Europe’s influence in a fast-changing world. 
Unraveling the nexus between security and integration means nothing less than rejecting the formula of Europe’s peace. 
Grand Mal Economics 
BERKELEY – Across the North Atlantic region, central bankers and governments seem, for the most part, helpless in restoring full employment to their economies. 
Europe has slipped back into recession without ever really recovering from the financial/sovereign-debt crisis that began in 2008. 
The United States’ economy is currently growing at 1.5% per year (about a full percentage point less than potential), and growth may slow, owing to a small fiscal contraction this year. 
Industrial market economies have been suffering from periodic financial crises, followed by high unemployment, at least since the Panic of 1825 nearly caused the Bank of England to collapse. 
Such episodes are bad for everybody – workers who lose their jobs, entrepreneurs and equity holders who lose their profits, governments that lose their tax revenue, and bondholders who suffer the consequences of bankruptcy – and we have had nearly two centuries to figure out how to deal with them. 
So why have governments and central banks failed? 
There are three reasons why the authorities might fail to restore full employment rapidly after a downturn. 
For starters, unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment. That was the problem in the 1970’s, but it is not the problem now. 
The second reason might be that even with anchored inflation expectations (and thus price stability), policymakers do not know how to keep them anchored while boosting the flow of spending in the economy. 
And here I stop, flummoxed. 
At least as I read the history, by 1829, Western Europe’s technocratic economists had figured out why these periodic grand mal economic seizures occurred. 
That year, Jean-Baptiste Say published his Cours Complet d’Economie Politique Pratique, admitting that Thomas Malthus had been at least half right in arguing that an economy could suffer for years from a “general glut” of commodities, with nearly everybody trying to reduce spending below income – in today’s jargon, to deleverage. 
And, because one person’s spending is another’s income, universal deleveraging produces only depression and high unemployment. 
Over the following century, economists like John Stuart Mill, Walter Bagehot, Irving Fisher, Knut Wicksell, and John Maynard Keynes devised a list of steps to take in order to avoid or cure a depression. 
1. Don’t go there in the first place: avoid whatever it is – whether external pressure under the gold standard, asset-price bubbles, or leverage-and-panic cycles such as that of 2003-2009 – that creates the desire to deleverage. 
2. If you do find yourself there, stop the desire to deleverage by having the central bank buy bonds for cash, thereby pushing down interest rates, so that holding debt becomes more attractive than holding cash. 
If you still find yourself there, stop the desire to deleverage by having the Treasury guarantee risky assets, or issue safe ones, in order to raise the quality of debt in the market; this, too, will make holding debt more attractive. 
4. If that fails, stop the desire to deleverage by promising to print more money in the future, which would raise the rate of inflation and make holding cash less attractive than spending it. 
5. In the worst case, have the government step in, borrow money, and buy stuff, thereby rebalancing the economy as the private sector deleverages. 
There are many subtleties in how governments and central banks should attempt to accomplish these steps. 
And, indeed, the North Atlantic region’s governments and central banks have tried to some degree. 
But it is clear that they have not tried enough: the “stop” signal of unanchored inflation expectations, accelerating price growth, and spiking long-term interest rates – all of which tell us that we have reached the structural and expectational limits of expansionary policy – has not yet been flashed. 
So we remain far short of full employment for the third reason. 
The issue is not that governments and central banks cannot restore employment, or do not know how; it is that governments and central banks will not take expansionary policy steps on a large enough scale to restore full employment rapidly. 
And here I reflect on the 1930’s, and on how historical events recur, appearing first as tragedy and then, pace Karl Marx, as yet another tragedy. 
Keynes begged the policymakers of his time to ignore the “austere and puritanical souls” who argue for “what they politely call a ‘prolonged liquidation’ to put us right,” and professed that he could “not understand how universal bankruptcy can do any good or bring us nearer to prosperity.” 
Today’s policymakers, so eager to draw a bold line under expansionary measures, should pause and consider the same question. 
The Unreality of the “Real” Business Cycle 
LONDON – Testifying recently before a United States congressional committee, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that the recent financial meltdown had shattered his “intellectual structure.” 
I am keen to understand what he meant. 
Since I have had no opportunity to ask him, I have to rely on his memoirs, The Age of Turbulence , for clues. 
But that book was published in 2007 – before, presumably, his intellectual structure fell apart. 
In his memoirs, Greenspan revealed that his favorite economist was Joseph Schumpeter, inventor of the concept of “creative destruction.” 
In Greenspan’s summary of Schumpeter’s thinking, a “market economy will incessantly revitalize itself from within by scrapping old and failing businesses and then reallocating resources to newer, more productive ones.” Greenspan had seen “this pattern of progress and obsolescence repeat over and over again.” 
Capitalism advanced the human condition, said Schumpeter, through a “perennial gale of creative destruction,” which he likened to a Darwinian process of natural selection to secure the “survival of the fittest.” 
As Greenspan tells it, the “rougher edges” of creative destruction were legislated away by Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, but after the wave of de-regulation of the 1970’s, America recovered much of its entrepreneurial, risk-taking ethos. 
As Greenspan notes, it was the dot-com boom of the 1990’s that “finally gave broad currency to Schumpeter’s idea of creative destruction.” 
This was the same Greenspan who in 1996 warned of “irrational exuberance” and, then, as Fed chairman, did nothing to check it. 
Both the phrase and his lack of action make sense in the light of his (now shattered) intellectual system. 
It is impossible to imagine a continuous gale of creative destruction taking place except in a context of boom and bust. 
Indeed, early theorists of business cycles understood this. 
(Schumpeter himself wrote a huge, largely unreadable book, with that title in 1939.) 
In classic business-cycle theory, a boom is initiated by a clutch of inventions – power looms and spinning jennies in the eighteenth century, railways in the nineteenth century, automobiles in the twentieth century. But competitive pressures and the long gestation period of fixed-capital outlays multiply optimism, leading to more investment being undertaken than is actually profitable. 
Such over-investment produces an inevitable collapse. 
Banks magnify the boom by making credit too easily available, and they exacerbate the bust by withdrawing it too abruptly. 
But the legacy is a more efficient stock of capital equipment. 
Dennis Robertson, an early twentieth-century “real” business-cycle theorist, wrote: “I do not feel confident that a policy which, in the pursuit of stability of prices, output, and employment, had nipped in the bud the English railway boom of the forties, or the American railway boom of 1869-71, or the German electrical boom of the nineties, would have been on balance beneficial to the populations concerned.” 
Contemporary “real” business-cycle theory builds a mountain of mathematics on top of these early models, the main effect being to minimize the “destructiveness” of the “creation.” 
It manages to combine technology-driven cycles of booms and recessions with markets that always clear (i.e., there is no unemployment). 
How is this trick accomplished? 
When a positive technological “shock” raises real wages, people will work more, causing output to surge. 
In the face of a negative “shock,” workers will increase their leisure, causing output to fall. 
These are efficient responses to changes in real wages. 
No intervention by government is needed. 
Bailing out inefficient automobile companies like General Motors only slows down the rate of progress. 
In fact, whereas most schools of economic thought maintain that one of government’s key responsibilities is to smooth the cycle, “real” business-cycle theory argues that reducing volatility reduces welfare! 
It is hard to see how this type of theory either explains today’s economic turbulence, or offers sound instruction about how to deal with it. 
First, in contrast to the dot-com boom, it is difficult to identify the technological “shock” that set off the boom. 
Of course, the upswing was marked by super-abundant credit. 
But this was not used to finance new inventions: it was the invention. 
It was called securitized mortgages. 
It left no monuments to human invention, only piles of financial ruin. 
Second, this type of model strongly implies that governments should do nothing in the face of such “shocks.” 
Indeed, “real” business-cycle economists typically argue that, but for Roosevelt’s misguided New Deal policies, recovery from the Great Depression of 1929-1933 would have been much faster than it was. 
Equivalent advice today would be that governments the world over are doing all the wrong things in bailing out top-heavy banks, subsidizing inefficient businesses, and putting obstacles in the way of rational workers spending more time with their families or taking lower-paid jobs. 
It reminds me of the interviewer who went to see Robert Lucas, one of the high priests of the New Business Cycle school, at a time of high American unemployment in the 1980’s. 
“My driver is an unemployed Ph.D. graduate,” he said to Lucas. “Well, I’d say that if he is driving a taxi, he’s a taxi-driver,” replied the 1995 Nobel Laureate. 
Although Schumpeter brilliantly captured the inherent dynamism of entrepreneur-led capitalism, his modern “real” successors smothered his insights in their obsession with “equilibrium” and “instant adjustments.” 
For Schumpeter, there was something both noble and tragic about the spirit of capitalism. 
But those sentiments are a world away from the pretty, polite techniques of his mathematical progeny. 
Pakistan’s Tipping Point 
LAHORE – Pakistan’s moment of political truth is fast approaching. 
On May 11, some 40-50 million voters will elect a new national assembly. 
The outcome, preceded by a spike in extremist violence, is likely to reverberate far and wide. 
Pakistan’s homegrown terrorist groups know that the country is at a tipping point, and are attacking candidates and voters who favor a secular state. 
Hundreds of people have already been killed, and more will undoubtedly die before Election Day, targeted because, if these groups prevail, they would push what is sometimes called the “idea of Pakistan” to its logical – and extreme – conclusion. 
Some 70 years ago, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan’s founding father, launched the movement to create an independent state for the Muslims of British India. 
The British colonial administration finally acquiesced, creating a country out of Muslim-majority areas. 
The population of what is now Pakistan was about two-thirds Muslim; the remainder were mostly Hindus and Sikhs. 
That composition changed dramatically with the partition of the new states of India and Pakistan in 1947, when 14 million people moved across the newly drawn border. 
Eight million Muslim refugees fled India and entered Pakistan, and six million Hindus and Sikhs moved in the opposite direction. 
By the time this “ethnic cleansing” was over, Pakistan’s population was 95% Muslim. 
Over time, an increasing proportion of this population began to demand the creation of an Islamic state in the areas that were now Pakistan. 
The upcoming election will determine how far the country will go along this route. 
Pakistan is not the only Muslim country seeking to redefine its political and economic future. 
Similar processes are playing out in other large countries in the western part of the Islamic world. 
By contrast, other large Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have succeeded in establishing political orders that serve all segments of highly diverse populations reasonably well. 
That may eventually happen in the western Islamic world as well, but only after a struggle of the type occurring now in Pakistan. 
The large countries in this part of the Islamic world – most notably Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey – are attempting to address four problems, the most challenging of which is to define Islam’s role in the political system. 
Turkey seems to have found an answer, prodded in part by its wish to join the European Union. 
A conservative ruling party with deep religious roots is content to leave religion to private observance, with no direct influence on public policy. 
The issue remains less settled in Egypt, while in Pakistan a small but highly motivated part of the population has embraced extreme violence as a form of political expression. 
The role of the military in politics also needs to be resolved. 
Once again, Turkey has taken the lead; in both Egypt and Pakistan, the men in uniform have returned to their barracks, but they have not lost influence over public policy. 
Then there is sectarianism, particularly the growing strife between Sunni and Shia Muslims. 
This conflict may be exacerbated by the outcome in Syria. 
If Sunnis triumph there, they may become more assertive in countries that have large Shia populations. 
It is not often recognized that Pakistan has the world’s second-largest Shia population, after Iran, with roughly 50 million adherents. 
They have been mercilessly attacked in Karachi and Quetta in recent years, with more than 400 killed. 
Finally, there is the question of the Muslim world’s relations with the West, particular the United States. 
The old post-Ottoman “grand bargain” – Western acceptance of authoritarianism in exchange for the secure flow of oil, use of sensitive sea-lanes, and some tolerance for the existence of Israel – has broken down. 
What replaces it will be determined by the shape of the new political order that finally emerges in the western Islamic world. 
In other words, more is at stake in Pakistan’s upcoming election than just the future of Pakistan. 
There is growing recognition, some of it grudging, that the coalition led by the Pakistan People’s Party has managed to create a political structure built on fairly stable foundations. 
This is a real accomplishment in a country that was on a political roller-coaster for most of its history. 
But the coalition proved unable to translate political success into strong economic performance. 
For the last five years, Pakistan’s annual GDP growth has averaged just 3% – half the rate needed to absorb two million new labor-force entrants every year. 
If growth does not pick up, the ranks of the unemployed and underemployed will swell, increasing the size of the pool from which extremist groups find fresh recruits. 
The upcoming election has both nurtured hope and generated anxiety among Pakistanis. 
It could go either way. 
And, for good or bad, where Pakistan goes other Muslim countries could follow. 
The Uptick’s Downside 
RIO DE JANEIRO – Since late last year, a series of positive developments has boosted investor confidence and led to a sharp rally in risky assets, starting with global equities and commodities. 
Macroeconomic data from the United States improved; blue-chip companies in advanced economies remained highly profitable; China and emerging markets slowed only moderately; and the risk of a disorderly default and/or exit by some members of the eurozone declined. 
Moreover, under its new president, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank appears willing to do anything necessary to reduce stress on the eurozone’s banking system and governments, as well as to lower interest rates. 
Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have provided massive injections of liquidity. 
Volatility is down, confidence is up, and risk aversion is much lower – for now. 
But at least four downside risks are likely to materialize this year, undermining global growth and eventually negatively affecting investor confidence and market valuations of risky assets. 
First, the eurozone is in deep recession, especially in the periphery, but now also in the core economies, as the latest data show an output contraction in Germany and France. 
The credit crunch in the banking system is becoming more severe as banks deleverage by selling assets and rationing credit, exacerbating the downturn. 
Meanwhile, not only is fiscal austerity pushing the eurozone periphery into economic free-fall, but the loss of competitiveness there will persist as relief at the waning prospect of disorderly defaults strengthens the euro’s value. 
To restore competitiveness and growth in these countries, the euro needs to fall towards parity with the US dollar. 
And, while the risk of a disorderly Greek collapse is now receding, it will re-emerge this year as political instability, civil unrest, and more fiscal austerity turn the Greek recession into a depression. 
Second, there is now evidence of weakening performance in China and the rest of Asia. 
In China, the economic slowdown underway is unmistakable. 
Export growth is down sharply, turning negative vis-à-vis the eurozone’s periphery. 
Import growth, a sign of future exports, has also fallen. 
Similarly, Chinese residential investment and commercial real-estate activity are slowing sharply as home prices start to fall. 
Infrastructure investment is down as well, with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales. 
Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore’s economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011. 
India’s government predicts 6.9% annual GDP growth in 2012, which would be the lowest rate since 2009. 
Taiwan’s economy fell into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
South Korea’s economy grew at a mere 0.4% in the same period – the slowest pace in two years – while Japan’s GDP contracted at a larger-than-expected 2.3%, as the yen’s strength weighed down exports. 
Third, while US data have been surprisingly encouraging, America’s growth momentum appears to be peaking. 
Fiscal tightening will escalate in 2012 and 2013, contributing to a slowdown, as will the expiration of tax benefits that boosted capital spending in 2011. 
Moreover, given continuing malaise in credit and housing markets, private consumption will remain subdued; indeed, two percentage points of the 2.8% expansion in the last quarter of 2011 reflected rising inventories rather than final sales. 
And, as for external demand, the generally strong dollar, together with the global and eurozone slowdown, will weaken US exports, while still-elevated oil prices will increase the energy import bill, further impeding growth. 
Finally, geopolitical risks in the Middle East are rising, owing to the possibility of an Israeli military response to Iran’s nuclear ambitions. 
While the risk of armed conflict remains low, the current war of words is escalating, as is the covert war in which Israel and the US are engaged with Iran; and now Iran is lashing back with terrorist attacks against Israeli diplomats. 
The Islamic Republic, with its back to the wall as sanctions bite, could also react by sinking a few ships to block the Strait of Hormuz, or by unleashing its proxies in the region – the pro-Iranian Shia in Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. 
Moreover, there are broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that will not ease – and that might intensify. 
The Arab Spring has produced a relatively favorable outcome in Tunisia, where it started, but developments in Egypt, Libya, and Yemen remain far more uncertain, while Syria is on the brink of civil war. 
In addition, there are substantial concerns about political stability in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia’s oil-rich Eastern Province, and potentially even in Kuwait and Jordan – all areas with substantial Shia or other restless populations. 
Beyond the countries affected by the Arab Spring, rising tensions between Shia, Kurdish, and Sunni factions in Iraq since the US withdrawal do not bode well for a boost in oil production. 
There is also the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, as well as strains between Israel and Turkey. 
In other words, there are many things that could go wrong in the Middle East, any combination of which might stoke fear in markets and lead to much higher oil prices. 
Despite weak economic growth in advanced economies and a slowdown in many emerging markets, oil is already at around $100 per barrel. 
But the fear premium could push it significantly higher, with predictably negative effects on the global economy. 
With so many risks in so many places, investors, not surprisingly, will eventually prize liquidity in their portfolios, while shunning riskier fixed assets again when these tail risks materialize. 
That is yet another reason to believe that the global economy remains far from achieving a balanced and sustainable recovery. 
Civilizing the City 
BANGALORE – Half of humanity – 3.5 billion people – live in urban areas today. 
Our metropolises are the engines of growth for a global economy emerging from the shadow of financial crisis. 
In Bangalore, my home, investment is pouring into a city at the forefront of the Indian economy’s transformation – home to companies like Infosys and Wipro, and named by Forbes Magazine as one of the “Fastest Growing Cities of the Next Decade.” 
But, as Bangalore’s citizens prepare to go to the polls in state elections, their concerns are not merely economic. 
The city’s financial success stories mask a darker reality – quality of life for many city-dwellers has deteriorated over recent years. 
The movement of the rural poor to large cities is one of the exemplary narratives of the modern era. 
And governments, which typically focus on crude measures of economic performance, encourage rapid urbanization. 
In China, for example, the relaxation of migration controls in the 1980’s and the opening of the economy led to the spectacular growth of the country’s eastern cities. 
More than 50% of Chinese live in urban areas today, up from 25% in 1990, and the proportion is expected to reach 70% by 2035. 
While the majority of Indians still live in rural areas, this, too, is changing fast. 
From 1970 to 2010, India’s urban population grew by 250 million. 
The next quarter-billion will be added in half that time. 
By 2030, 70% of India’s GDP will come from its cities. 
But cities are simply unable to cope with the influx of migrants on the current scale. 
The fast-growing metropolises of India, China, Brazil, and other major emerging economies offer plenty of jobs, but basic amenities are lacking; as a result, many of the urban poor live in slums, without adequate health care, water supplies, or electricity. 
The problems are legion. 
Municipalities, often owing to corruption or poor management, are unable or unwilling to impose rigorous planning regulations. 
Infrastructure spending is either inadequate or poorly targeted. 
Workers come home from their jobs to homes that are dark, dank, and depressing. 
They feel unsafe on poorly-lit streets, and have little access to parks or recreational facilities. 
Mornings and evenings are lost to long commutes on polluted highways. 
The novelty of the rapid economic improvements seen by many city-dwellers in India, China, and elsewhere over the past ten years has insulated governments from the repercussions of poor urban planning. 
As I take my morning strolls through Bangalore, though, I sense growing resentment of the inadequacies, and frustration at insufficient improvements in citizens’ quality of life. 
Democracy exists precisely to remedy the kinds of injustices I hear from the hardworking Bangaloreans I encounter on the street and online. 
Bangalore is a modern city, and its citizens are expressing their displeasure in modern ways – on Facebook, in chat rooms, and on Twitter. 
Governments would do well to heed these complaints (indeed, to engage with them in these hi-tech incarnations of a town-hall meeting), because civil unrest could disrupt the positive momentum, not only in cities, but in the entire global economy. 
That threat might seem far-off while growth continues at relatively high rates; but, unless workers see the benefit of their labors in the form of improved living conditions, protests could ensue. 
Already, there have been major strikes at factories across China – Motorola, Honda, and Foxconn, among others. 
That would have been unheard of several years ago, as would today’s growing trend among China’s urban middle classes for de-urbanization – a brain drain whereby educated city dwellers give up on the rat race and return to the countryside in pursuit of cleaner air, open spaces, and better accommodation. 
Our cities risk becoming literally uninhabitable. 
Of the world’s ten most densely populated cities, seven are in India. 
The urban sprawl of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore has continued unchecked, unplanned, and with under-investment in infrastructure for far too long. 
Urban pollution contributed to 620,000 needless deaths in India last year, mainly among the very poor. 
The number of people living in our slums has doubled over the past decade, and is now greater than the population of the United Kingdom. 
The consultancy McKinsey argues in a recent report that India needs to invest at least $1.2 trillion in its urban infrastructure over the next two decades, or $134 per capita annually. 
It currently invests only $17 per capita, compared to $116 in China and $292 in the United States. 
India spends less on health care and education per capita than China, Brazil, South Africa, or Mexico. 
If India is to maintain its competitiveness, a focus on dramatically improving the nation’s urban areas is imperative. 
McKinsey calculates that the country requires between 700-900 million square meters of new residential and commercial space each year; 350-400 kilometers (217-248 miles) of metros and subways (20 times what has been achieved in the past decade); and 19,000-25,000 kilometers of annual road construction (equivalent to all the roads built over the past ten years). 
The task is daunting. 
But, despite the grumbling, India’s city dwellers – like those elsewhere – do not want to sacrifice the enormous gains of the past few decades to ineffective or corrupt governance. 
They want to work toward a future in which their quality of life is among the best in the world, with green spaces, sustainable public transport, clean air, well-built houses, and safe streets. 
This is why I have set up the Nammu Bengaluru (“Our Bangalore”) Awards. 
It is important to recognize those who are contributing to the vision of a city that is feted not just for its economic successes, but also for its quality of life. 
Their example is one that emerging-country urbanites everywhere should seek to emulate. 
Globalizing the Security Council 
BRASILIA – The 1945 United Nations Charter represented a historic breakthrough in the pursuit of peace on a multilateral basis. 
At the end of a global war that claimed more than 50 million lives, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the world’s two major powers. 
The UN Charter, initially negotiated by the US, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom during World War II, established a Security Council containing five permanent members, including France and the Republic of China. 
At its inception, the UN brought together 51 countries; it now has 193 member states. 
But, although the Security Council was enlarged in 1965 by increasing the number of non-permanent seats from six to ten, its permanent members have not changed since 1945. 
The world has gone through extraordinary transformations since then. 
In addition to interstate conflict and the proliferation of weapons – particularly weapons of mass destruction – new challenges have emerged, such as terrorism and the involvement of non-state actors in internal conflicts. 
Meanwhile, the global distribution of economic and political power has undergone a radical reconfiguration, setting the stage for the emergence of a multipolar international order. 
In this environment, the Security Council’s frozen composition is imposing significant limits on the international community’s capacity to address global challenges. 
Conflicts drag on without proper action from the body created to resolve them. 
Thousands of civilians die, are displaced, or are subjected to appalling human-rights abuses, while the Security Council proves unable or unwilling to act. 
Reform of the Council is thus urgent and indispensable. 
A majority of UN member states are in favor of creating a new Council with an expanded roster of both permanent and non-permanent members. 
This majority reflects a growing perception that the world would be more stable and more secure with a strengthened and updated multilateral system. 
That means adding new voices to reflect the world in which we now live. 
Only then will the Security Council have the legitimacy to act on today’s manifold conflicts. 
A reformed Security Council would reflect the emergence of new powers and their readiness to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. 
In the financial and economic arena, this new multipolarity has already led to quota reforms at the International Monetary Fund and resulted in the consolidation of the G-20 as the premier venue for multilateral economic-policy coordination. 
The contrast with matters of peace and security is stark. 
Entire regions of the world, such as Africa and Latin America, are excluded from the nucleus of decision-making. 
A governing body that is not representative fuels uncertainty and frustration among those subject to its decisions, undermining the legitimacy – and thus the effectiveness – of its actions. 
The greatest risk that we run is erosion of the Security Council’s credibility, and, with it, a diminishing capacity to confront grave threats to peace. 
We all stand to lose if new international crises end up being addressed by coalitions of countries at the margins of the Security Council and in a manner that flouts international law. 
The lessons of the recent past are clear. 
In any conflict, neighboring countries’ participation and commitment are indispensable to the achievement of peace. 
Only an expanded Security Council can enable effective conflict resolution worldwide. 
The international community cannot afford to postpone reform. 
It is our duty to preserve the multilateral system of peace and security – an achievement of the international community that, despite its shortcomings, has helped save the planet from another war on a global scale. 
Only an increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent seats can remedy the representation deficit within the Security Council and adapt it to the realities of the twenty-first century. 
If new members and regions are not offered a seat at the table, the Council will face increasing irrelevance – and the world, more than ever in need of effective conflict resolution, will be far worse off. 
The Sino-American Mirror 
HONG KONG – November was a month of major leadership changes around the world, including Xi Jinping’s confirmation as China’s top official and US President Barack Obama’s re-election. 
The changes highlighted the sharp differences between the two countries’ political systems. 
Yet the two countries share similar national development goals:increasing their citizens’ prosperity, narrowing social inequities, and addressing environmental sustainability. 
The fact is that rapid social, technological, and environmental change is challenging both the Western and Chinese models of governance and development, with both requiring significant reform. 
And both countries’ leaders must deliver reforms within a limited tenure, with limited resources, and within a global context of trade rivalry and interdependence. 
In the United States, where markets, the judiciary, and regulation are highly developed, the imperative is not institutional reform, but policy reform – addressing the weak fiscal position, income and wealth inequities, unemployment, health care, and deteriorating physical infrastructure. 
For China, the issue largely concerns the design and implementation of the next stage of institutional reforms to sustain economic growth and efficiency, reduce social inequality, remove market distortions, address environmental deterioration, and combat corruption. 
As China becomes a more urban and elderly middle-income society, the challenge for the new leadership is not only to meet the population’s need for employment, health care, and social security, but also to improve governance and state effectiveness by establishing checks and balances on political power. 
Both countries face formidable resistance to reform from formidable vested interests and lobby groups. 
Both also face major price distortions, owing to quantitative easing by monetary policymakers, which has led to negative real interest rates. 
To some extent, the two countries’ problems are mirror images of each other. 
The US lacks investment in infrastructure and has excess investment in financial derivatives – the result of opaque leverage from over-consumption. 
China suffers from under-consumption and possible over-investment, and needs to strike a balance between the state-owned sector and private enterprise. 
American democracy’s emphasis on short time horizons is costly, with tax cuts and increased welfare benefits giving rise to chronic fiscal deficits, with future generations forced to foot the bill for years of excessive consumption. 
In China, the one-party system has been effective in delivering strong growth, but it must now address the rampant corruption and excessive bureaucracy that has crowded out the private sector and limited creativity and innovation. 
China and the US can draw important lessons from the strengths and weaknesses inherent in both systems. 
First, in both countries, the challenge is not one of state versus market, but about finding complementarities between the two. 
The state performs best when it delineates, protects, and adjudicates property rights, while the market works best when it allocates property rights and aligns people’s incentives. 
Second, both countries must find the right metric to balance short-term and long-term interests. 
Given inter-generational demands, large spillover effects between different communities, and interdependence with the rest of the world, any governance system must weigh the interests of ruling elites and lobbyists against those of weaker groups without voice, and popular demands against long-term planning. 
Finally, the issue for both countries is not corruption or inequality – which are universal – but equal opportunity and, in China’s case, respect for property rights. 
Opaque and unfair delineation and allocation of land rights in China, together with state monopolies and burdensome bureaucracies, create distortions that give rise to corruption and inequities. 
China’s main priority should be to strengthen its legal institutions to protect property rights, while reducing state ownership and control of resources and large enterprises. 
So far, Xi’s down-to-earth approach has raised hopes that China will enter a new phase of reform that will address economic imbalances, increase social inclusion, and tackle endemic corruption. 
In the US, Obama’s re-election has led some to believe that much-needed policy reforms will bring the country back from the brink of the “fiscal cliff” and ignite a new era of growth. 
Yet the two leaders and their administrations must overcome monumental challenges as their countries strive to reach the next stage of their development. 
How they use monetary, fiscal, structural, institutional, and regulatory policies may differ, but each will ultimately be judged by how close he comes to achieving that goal. 
The Sino-American Test in North Korea 
MADRID – Repeated threats from North Korea have turned the Korean Peninsula into one of the world’s most dangerous hotspots. 
But the situation also offers an important opportunity: a gain in strategic trust between China and the United States, the two countries with the capacity to resolve the tensions once and for all. 
If they manage to cooperate constructively in order to shape a peace acceptable to all sides, this would make not only Korea, but also the region and the world, a safer place. 
Ten years after opting out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, North Korea clearly possesses nuclear weapons. 
The regime’s nuclear test in February – its third since 2006 – was likely a miniaturized device, which makes the situation even more worrying, given that successful miniaturization is critical for using nuclear weapons in ballistic missiles. 
February’s test provoked another round of United Nations sanctions, drafted by the US and China, triggering an escalation of threats and provocations from the North. 
The tension on the peninsula increased further with the annual joint military exercises conducted by the US and South Korea – especially when American nuclear-capable B-52 and B-2 bombers were added to the drills. 
Nobody wants war on the Korean Peninsula. 
For the North, it would be suicide; for the South, with its vibrant economy and widening free-trade agreements, the opportunity cost would be particularly high. 
Likewise, regional stability is a prerequisite of China’s stellar economic growth, and military conflict would be a setback for US economic rebirth as well. 
Indeed, with US defense spending finally set to decline after a decade of debt-financed war in Iraq and Afghanistan, America has little fiscal room for an unforeseen military entanglement. 
The US “pivot” to Asia is built on economic opportunities there; a conflict with unpredictable fallout does not fit the scheme. 
China is the key geostrategic player in resolving the conflict, because it provides North Korea with 90% of its energy, 80% of its consumer goods, and 40% of its food. 
But it is unclear how much influence China’s government holds over Kim Jong-un’s regime. 
Sino-North Korean relations have borne a significant scar since 1991, when China recognized South Korea without insisting that the US formally recognize the North. 
The North Koreans believe that China sacrificed them for commercial interests, and bilateral relations have yet to recover. 
Nonetheless, China continues to regard North Korea as an important strategic asset, because it serves as a buffer state shielding China’s border from American troops on the peninsula – which has historically been used as an entry point by invading troops. 
China’s ideal solution would therefore be to maintain the status quo while persuading the North to open up – a path of gradual change that avoids open conflict or the regime’s collapse. 
Either of these traumatic outcomes would spell disaster, for both the region and the world. 
First, the regime’s implosion would unleash a massive refugee flow, implying enormous social and economic costs. 
Moreover, Asia remains a continent defined by balance-of-power diplomacy, border conflicts, and historic mistrust, with no multilateral security structures to soften regional tensions. 
Given these conditions, even a small spark could ignite a wildfire. 
In this environment, mistrust of China’s rise as a regional hegemon in much of East Asia only intensifies the need for active Chinese participation in promoting regional stability and peace – a peace framework with Asian roots, acceptable to all parties. 
Only through such efforts will China be able to increase its international legitimacy, thereby minimizing the risk of future conflict. 
It is essential that China and the US work together to resolve the current crisis. 
The US must reiterate clearly that indefinitely prolonging the status quo on the Korean Peninsula would imply a strategic loss for China, and that China must join the international community in its efforts to halt North Korea’s nuclear program. 
This cooperation is the only way to force the North’s hand and put an end to the incessant cycle of crisis and mounting risk. 
The current crisis offers a unique test case for joint handling of international affairs – or, in this case, regional affairs with global consequences – by the world’s two biggest powers. 
During US Secretary of State John Kerry’s trip to China this month, the two countries pronounced their shared goals: denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and durable peace in the region. 
This is a good starting point. 
Sino-US cooperation on this flashpoint could be a huge step forward in building much-needed bilateral strategic trust. 
But the two countries’ markedly different foreign-policy approaches will not facilitate matters. 
While the US tends to segment problems in order to find solutions to each part within a finite period of time, China relies on broad, long-term perspective and views issues as extended, relative processes. 
That is why, in dealing with impoverished, isolated, nuclearized North Korea, where Sino-US cooperation is the only option, the US and China face both a challenge and an opportunity. 
To make the most of it requires a significant boost in mutual strategic trust. 
The US-China Dialogue of the Deaf 
NEW YORK – The visit on January 19 of China’s president, Hu Jintao, is coming at a time when economic conflict between the United States and China has become one of the most worrying global developments. 
Throughout last year, the US pressed China to revalue the renminbi, while China blamed the US Federal Reserve policy of “quantitative easing” for currency-market turmoil. 
The two sides are talking past each other, though both are making valid points. 
The global imbalances that were at the root at the Crash of 2008 have not been corrected – indeed, some have grown larger. 
The US still consumes more than it produces, running a chronic trade deficit. 
Consumption remains too high, at nearly 70% of GDP, compared to an unsustainably low 35.6% of GDP in China. 
Households are over-indebted and must save more. 
The US economy needs higher productivity, but US corporations, which are operating very profitably, are accumulating cash instead of investing it – with quantitative easing aimed at heading off deflation. 
In China, by contrast, bank lending needs to be reigned in, but regulatory efforts have been hindered by off-balance-sheet financing and the development of an informal quasi-banking sector. The economy is showing signs of over-heating. 
These imbalances could be reduced by the US using fiscal rather than monetary stimulus, and China allowing the renminbi to appreciate in an orderly manner. 
But domestic politics in both countries stand in the way. 
In the US, the Republicans, who won the mid-term elections, were determined to extend the Bush tax cuts in their entirety. This leaves little room for fiscal stimulus, while the tax cut is more likely to be saved than invested. 
That is why the Fed had to resort to quantitative easing, even though it tends to stimulate asset bubbles rather than productive investments. 
China interprets quantitative easing as a plot to devalue the dollar and force a revaluation of the renminbi. 
The US, in turn, cannot understand why China should be so reluctant to allow the renminbi to appreciate, as doing so would help to dampen inflationary pressures. 
Maintaining a two-tier currency system and an undervalued currency has been the key to China’s success. 
It is much more efficient than taxation as a means of skimming a significant share of payments for Chinese exports, which accrue as currency reserves and can be used at the central government’s discretion. This has made the central government very powerful, attracting the best brains into its service. 
China would prefer to improve the trade balance through removal of trade barriers rather than exchange-rate adjustment, because it is reluctant to put additional strain on its export industries and eager to gain access to American technology. 
The US maintains restrictions on high-tech exports to China because of the latter’s lack of respect for intellectual property rights. The US prefers higher Chinese import prices to help relieve deflationary pressures – which would also eliminate the need for quantitative easing, removing a source of Chinese complaints. 
As things stand now, each country is pursuing policies that do not help the other and are suboptimal for their own economies. 
The entire global economy would benefit if both sides listened to each other and coordinated their economic policies. 
The conflict in economic policy is spreading to the geopolitical sphere. First, China asserted a “core interest” in the South China Sea, effectively claiming its 200-mile “special economic zone” throughout the region as territorial waters. 
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton countered that America also has “interests” in this area, bringing the two countries to loggerheads over a vast and critically important maritime region in Asia. 
Then China became embroiled with Japan in a dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku Islands. 
Few Westerners appreciate how seriously China takes this issue. Geologically, the islands are connected to Taiwan, and Japan gained control over them by taking possession of Taiwan in 1895. 
This elevates these uninhabited rocks to the same level of importance as Taiwan or Tibet for the official “one China doctrine.” 
China greatly resented it when the US endorsed the Japanese position. 
China’s rapid rise, and America’s equally rapid loss of power and influence, has created a dangerous situation. 
With the exception of the peaceful transition of world leadership from Britain to the US after World War I, such global power shifts have always involved armed conflict. 
The deterioration in US-China relations is particularly troubling because it takes place against a background of global imbalances and serious internal political divisions, which drive both countries to take intransigent positions. 
The global imbalances could be cured, and conflicts avoided, only by greater international cooperation. 
But macroeconomic policy is not the only area that would benefit from better understanding between the two countries. 
Consider Afghanistan. The country is rich in mineral resources that China needs, but it is the US that spends $10 billion a month occupying a country whose annual GDP is only $15 billion. 
As things stand, the US is likely to reduce its presence before Afghanistan is pacified and the mineral resources developed. Since China is the obvious market for these minerals, it would make sense for China to encourage continued American engagement by making a significant contribution to the cost of training the Afghan army. 
China was farsighted when it adopted the doctrine of harmonious development, but recently it has veered from it. 
Apparently, the rate of change has been too rapid for Chinese leaders to adjust to it. 
The leadership is preoccupied with taking care of the needs of its own people, many of whom still live in poverty. 
But China has become a great power, with all the obligations for maintaining world order that go with it, whether or not the leadership acknowledges it. 
When US President Barack Obama visited China in November 2009, he acknowledged China’s rapid rise and offered a partnership in maintaining and improving the world order. 
But the Chinese leadership declined the offer, explaining that China is a developing country that can hardly meet its own people’s needs. 
That rift is unfortunate, because improvement in Chinese living standards ought to go hand-in-hand with Chinese participation in building a better world order. 
Only if China pays closer attention to how it is perceived and accepted by the rest of the world can it continue to rise in a peaceful manner. 
China’s leadership knows that it must fulfill its own people’s minimum expectations in order to maintain internal peace and stability; now it must learn to make itself acceptable to the rest of the world in order to preserve external peace and stability. That means becoming a more open society and playing a more active role in maintaining a peaceful and stable world order. 
China ought to regard this not as a burdensome necessity, but as an inspiration to greatness. 
The best periods in Chinese history were those in which the country was most open both internally and towards the outside world. 
By contrast, when it comes to military might, China will not be a match for the US for some time to come. 
If current trends continue, China is bound to devote an increasing proportion of its resources to the military at the expense of the general population, whose expectations the leadership will find increasingly difficult to meet. 
In that case, today’s prosperity is likely to prove transient. 
Worried neighbors are likely to seek protection under the wings of the American eagle, reinforcing the US military budget, which is already oversized. 
Unless a deliberate effort is made by both sides to reach a better understanding, the world faces a turbulent time in 2011 and beyond. 
China and the American Dream 
PARIS – China may be just a few years away from becoming the world’s leading economic power, and America’s strategic centrality may be on the wane (certainly, no one speaks of the United States today as the world’s “hyperpower”). 
But America still makes people dream, and its emotional hold on the world remains unique. 
In this sense, last week brought two victories: not just Barack Obama’s over Republican challenger Mitt Romney in the presidential election, but also the victory of America’s democratic system over China’s one-party authoritarianism. 
In a few sentences of his victory speech – the space of a magic moment – Obama celebrated “the mystery of democracy” in a very concrete, but also nearly religious manner. 
Obama found the right words with which to pay tribute to the multitude of anonymous citizens going door to door to convince their fellow Americans to vote for their preferred candidates. 
He was describing democracy at its best, its most noble, as it should be, but not always is: freely mobilized men and women able and willing to change the course of their destiny. 
At this moment, however brief, America’s soft power defeated by a knockout that of China, which less than one day later solemnly – and in the most opaque manner – opened the 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Millions of people around the world would rather experience for themselves an election night like America’s than become a part of China’s long-term plans. 
Of course, America is no longer what it used to be. 
It is far too indebted to be the ultimate strategic and economic insurance policy for its allies, as it was in the past. 
But, if America’s protective power has receded, its power to inspire remains unique and can still redound to its benefit in the most spectacular way. 
Obama’s victory was not only that of democracy, but also of a certain vision and message of America. 
By keeping an open stance on immigration, maintaining a respectful discourse toward all who want to live out their differences freely, and considering women in a modern and dignified manner, Obama was able to mobilize the strength of America’s exceptionalism, which rests on one key word: diversity. 
In deliberately ignoring this diversity and embracing nostalgia for a long-gone past, the Republican Party – led astray by its ultra-conservative lunatics – was far more responsible than its decent candidate for the defeat. 
Romney’s mistake was to align himself for too long with ideas that were too radical for him – and for America. 
The fate of Romney’s candidacy contains a universal message for all democratic regimes: One wins nothing by cultivating the extremes or by becoming their captive. 
In fact, one runs the risk of losing not only one’s soul, but also elections. 
That was Nicolas Sarkozy’s fate in France: he was defeated after losing the support of the center of the electorate. 
Obama was reelected because the Republican Party lost sight of the center in America. 
Of course, the greatness of America’s democracy should not hide its deep flaws and current dysfunction. 
The cost of this election cycle surpassed $2 billion – all to reproduce the status quo: the same president, and the same balance of power in the US Congress. 
Money has become a corrosive agent that is eroding and redefining the democratic process, with the mobilization of personal energies giving way to the enlargement of campaign budgets. 
Beyond the issue of money, there is the problem of a system of checks and balances run amok, leading to governmental paralysis. 
“Vetocracy” – reflected in the Republicans’ routine Congressional obstructionism in Obama’s first term – is a threat to democracy. 
Will the party, chastened by its electoral defeat, recognize that its responsibility is to the American people, and not only to its members and followers? 
Obama’s reelection sends a message, but one that will resonate widely – including at home – only if rhetoric does not depart from reality, as was too often the case during Obama’s first term. 
America cannot continue to live with the injustices of its health-care system or with crumbling and obsolete infrastructure. 
Nor can it remain indifferent to the increasingly unacceptable indebtedness of its university students. 
At the same time, while America may no longer be the international actor that it once was, domestic production of shale oil and gas appears set to re-write the US energy equation – as it could for France and other Western countries, which may one day be able to do without the energy supplied by the Middle East. 
America’s main challenge globally is to accept that it will no longer be alone at the top. 
It has never had to deal with others as equals, unlike traditional European powers, which have done so for centuries. 
China’s challenge, however, may be more difficult. 
It not only has to live with the reality of US power; it must also take into account the American ideal. 
In 1989, large numbers of Chinese students took over Tiananmen Square to demand more rights, adopting a symbol resembling the Statue of Liberty. 
Today, too, it is not America’s military strength that threatens or challenges China, but rather the enduring attraction of “the American dream.” 
America’s Third-World Politics 
CAMBRIDGE – With its presidential election over, the United States can finally take a breather from campaign politics, at least for a while. 
But an uncomfortable question lingers: How is it possible for the world’s most powerful country and its oldest continuous democracy to exhibit a state of political discourse that is more reminiscent of a failed African state? 
Maybe that is too harsh an assessment of Africa’s nascent democracies. 
If you think I exaggerate, you have not been paying close attention. 
The pandering to extremist groups, the rejection of science, the outright lies and distortions, and the evasion of the real issues that characterized the most recent election cycle set a new low for democratic politics. 
Without question, the worst offenders are America’s Republicans, whose leaders have somehow become enraptured by ideas that are beyond the pale in other advanced countries. 
Of the party’s dozen presidential candidates, only two (Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman) declined to reject scientific evidence concerning global warming and its human causes. 
But, when pressed on it, Romney was sufficiently uncomfortable about his position that he wobbled on the issue. 
The Darwinian theory of evolution has long been a dirty word among Republicans as well. 
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas and an early frontrunner in the Republican primary, called it just a “theory out there,” while Romney himself has had to argue that it is consistent with creationism – the idea that an intelligent force designed the universe and brought it into being. 
Likewise, if there is an archaic idea in economics, it is that the US should return to the Gold Standard. 
Yet, this idea, too, has strong support within the Republican Party – led by Ron Paul, another contender for the party’s presidential nomination. 
No one was surprised when the party’s platform gave a nod to the Gold Standard in its convention in August. 
Most non-Americans would find it crazy that neither Romney nor Barack Obama supported stricter gun-control laws (with Obama making an exception only for assault weapons such as AK-47s), in a country where it is sometimes easier to buy guns than it is to vote. 
Most Europeans cannot understand how, in a civilized country, both candidates can favor the death penalty. 
And I won’t even get into the abortion debate. 
Candidate Romney was so cowed by his party’s obsession with low taxes that he never put forth a budget that added up. 
It was left to his spinners to explain, as The Economist put it, that this was “necessary rubbish, concocted to persuade the fanatics who vote in the Republican primaries.” 
Obama, for his part, catered to economic nationalists by attacking Romney as an “outsourcing pioneer” and calling him an “outsourcer in chief” – as if outsourcing were evil, could be stopped, or Obama himself had done much to discourage it. 
So rampant were the equivocations, untruths, and outright lies from both camps that many media outlets and non-partisan groups maintained running lists of factual distortions. 
One of the best known, FactCheck.org, an initiative of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, confessed that this campaign had kept them exceptionally busy. 
Some of the most egregious examples included Obama’s claims that Romney was planning to raise taxes by $2,000 on middle-income taxpayers and/or cut taxes by $5 trillion, and that Romney backed a law that would outlaw “all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.” 
Romney went even further, claiming that Obama planned to raise taxes by $4,000 on middle-income taxpayers; that Obama planned “to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements”; and that Chrysler, bailed out by the Obama administration, was moving all of its Jeep production to China. 
None of these claims was true. 
“It’s been that sort of campaign,” FactCheck.org’s analysts wrote, “filled from beginning to end with deceptive attacks and counterattacks, and dubious claims.” 
Meanwhile, over the course of three televised presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate, climate change, the signature issue of our time and the most serious problem confronting our planet, was not mentioned even once. 
One can draw two possible conclusions from America’s election. 
One is that the US will ultimately be undone by the poor quality of its democratic discourse, and that it is merely at the start of an inevitable decline. The symptoms are there, even if the disease has not yet infected the entire body. 
The other possibility is that what is said and done during an election makes little difference to a polity’s health. 
Campaigns are always a time for cheap populism and kowtowing to single-issue fundamentalists. 
Perhaps what really matters is what happens after a candidate takes office: the quality of the checks and balances within which he or she operates, the advice offered, the decisions taken, and, ultimately, the policies pursued. 
But, if American elections are nothing other than entertainment, why is so much money spent on them, and why do so many people get so exercised over them? 
Can the answer be that the outcome would be even worse otherwise? 
To paraphrase Winston Churchill, elections are the worst way to select a political leader, save for all other methods that have been tried – and nowhere more so than in America. 
The Use and Abuse of Religious Freedom 
MELBOURNE – What are the proper limits of religious freedom? 
Marianne Thieme, leader of the Party for the Animals in the Netherlands, offers this answer: “Religious freedom stops where human or animal suffering begins.” 
The Party for the Animals, the only animal-rights party to be represented in a national parliament, has proposed a law requiring that all animals be stunned before slaughter. 
The proposal has united Islamic and Jewish leaders in defense of what they see as a threat to their religious freedom, because their religious doctrines prohibit eating meat from animals that are not conscious when killed. 
The Dutch parliament has given the leaders a year to prove that their religions’ prescribed methods of slaughter cause no more pain than slaughter with prior stunning. 
If they cannot do so, the requirement to stun before slaughtering will be implemented. 
Meanwhile, in the United States, Catholic bishops have claimed that President Barack Obama is violating their religious freedom by requiring all big employers, including Catholic hospitals and universities, to offer their employees health insurance that covers contraception. 
And, in Israel, the ultra-orthodox, who interpret Jewish law as prohibiting men from touching women to whom they are not related or married, want separate seating for men and women on buses, and to halt the government’s plan to end exemption from military service for full-time religious students (63,000 in 2010). 
When people are prohibited from practicing their religion – for example, by laws that bar worshiping in certain ways – there can be no doubt that their freedom of religion has been violated. 
Religious persecution was common in previous centuries, and still occurs in some countries today. 
But prohibiting the ritual slaughter of animals does not stop Jews or Muslims from practicing their religion. 
During the debate on the Party for the Animals’ proposal, Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs, Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands, told members of parliament: “If we no longer have people who can do ritual slaughter in the Netherlands, we will stop eating meat.” 
Neither Islam nor Judaism upholds a requirement to eat meat. 
And I am not calling upon Jews and Muslims to do any more than I have chosen to do myself, for ethical reasons, for more than 40 years. 
Restricting the legitimate defense of religious freedom to rejecting proposals that stop people from practicing their religion makes it possible to resolve many other disputes in which it is claimed that freedom of religion is at stake. 
For example, allowing men and women to sit in any part of a bus does not violate orthodox Jews’ religious freedom, because Jewish law does not command that one use public transport. 
It’s just a convenience that one can do without – and orthodox Jews can hardly believe that the laws to which they adhere were intended to make life maximally convenient. 
Likewise, the Obama administration’s requirement to provide health insurance that covers contraception does not prevent Catholics from practicing their religion. 
Catholicism does not oblige its adherents to run hospitals and universities. 
(The government already exempts parishes and dioceses, thereby drawing a distinction between institutions that are central to the freedom to practice one’s religion and those that are peripheral to it.) 
Of course, the Catholic Church would be understandably reluctant to give up its extensive networks of hospitals and universities. 
My guess is that, before doing so, they would come to see the provision of health-insurance coverage for contraception as compatible with their religious teachings. 
But, if the Church made the opposite decision, and handed over its hospitals and universities to bodies that were willing to provide the coverage, Catholics would still be free to worship and follow their religion’s teachings. 
Religious exemption from military service can be more difficult to resolve, because some religions teach pacifism. 
That problem is usually resolved by providing alternative service that is no less arduous than military service (so that such religions do not attract adherents for that reason alone), but that does not involve fighting or killing. 
Judaism, however, is not pacifist, so, once again, there is no real issue of religious freedom at stake. 
The ultra-orthodox want exemption for those who spend their time studying the Torah on the grounds that Torah study is as important as military service to Israel’s well-being. 
Providing the option of non-combatant national service thus will not resolve this dispute, unless it consists of Torah study. 
But there is no reason why Israel’s secular majority should share the belief that having tens of thousands of ultra-orthodox scholars studying the Torah provides any benefit at all to the nation, and it is certainly not as arduous as military service. 
Not all conflicts between religion and the state are easy to resolve. 
But the fact that these three issues, all currently causing controversy in their respective countries, are not really about the freedom to practice one’s religion, suggests that the appeal to religious freedom is being misused. 
The Uses and Abuses of Economic Ideology 
LONDON – John Maynard Keynes famously wrote that “the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than commonly understood. 
Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” 
But I suspect that a greater danger lies elsewhere, with the practical men and women employed in the policymaking functions of central banks, regulatory agencies, governments, and financial institutions’ risk-management departments tending to gravitate to simplified versions of the dominant beliefs of economists who are, in fact, very much alive. 
Indeed, at least in the arena of financial economics, a vulgar version of equilibrium theory rose to dominance in the years before the financial crisis, portraying market completion as the cure to all problems, and mathematical sophistication decoupled from philosophical understanding as the key to effective risk management. 
Institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, in its Global Financial Stability Reviews (GFSR), set out a confident story of a self-equilibrating system. 
Thus, only 18 months before the crisis erupted, the April 2006 GFSR approvingly recorded “a growing recognition that the dispersion of credit risks to a broader and more diverse group of investors… has helped make the banking and wider financial system more resilient. 
The improved resilience may be seen in fewer bank failures and more consistent credit provision.” Market completion, in other words, was the key to a safer system. 
So risk managers in banks applied the techniques of probability analysis to “value at risk” calculations, without asking whether samples of recent events really carried strong inferences for the probable distribution of future events. 
And at regulatory agencies like Britain’s Financial Services Authority (which I lead), the belief that financial innovation and increased market liquidity were valuable because they complete markets and improve price discovery was not just accepted; it was part of the institutional DNA. 
This belief system did not, of course, exclude the possibility of market intervention. 
But it did determine assumptions about the appropriate nature and limits of intervention. 
For example, regulation to protect retail customers could, sometimes, be appropriate: requirements for information disclosure could help overcome asymmetries of information between businesses and consumers. 
Similarly, regulation and enforcement to prevent market abuse was justifiable, because rational agents can also be greedy, corrupt, or even criminal. 
And regulation to increase market transparency was not only acceptable, but a central tenet of the doctrine, since transparency, like financial innovation, was believed to complete markets and help generate increased liquidity and price discovery. 
But the belief system of regulators and policymakers in the most financially advanced centers tended to exclude the possibility that rational profit-seeking by professional market participants might generate rent-seeking behavior and financial instability rather than social benefit – even though several economists had clearly shown why that could happen. 
Policymakers’ conventional wisdom reflected, therefore, a belief that only interventions aimed at identifying and correcting the very specific imperfections blocking attainment of the nirvana of market equilibrium were legitimate. 
Transparency was essential in order to reduce information costs, but it was beyond the ideology to recognize that information imperfections might be so deep as to be unfixable, and that some forms of trading activity, however transparent, might be socially useless. 
Indeed, the Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, in a famous essay in Foreign Affairs entitled “Capital Myth,” talked of a “Wall Street/Treasury” complex that fused interests and ideologies. 
Bhagwati argued that this fusion played a role in turning liberalization of short-term capital flows into an article of faith, despite sound theoretical reasons for caution and slim empirical evidence of benefits. 
And, in the wider triumph of the precepts of financial deregulation and market completion, both interests and ideology have clearly played a role. 
Pure interests – expressed through lobbying power – were undoubtedly important to several key deregulation measures in the US, whose political system and campaign-finance rules are peculiarly conducive to the power of specific lobbies. 
Interests and ideology often interact in ways so subtle that is difficult to disentangle them, the influence of interests being achieved through an unconsciously accepted ideology. 
The financial sector dominates non-academic employment of professional economists. 
Because they are only human, they will tend implicitly to support – or at least not aggressively challenge – the conventional wisdom that serves the industry’s interests, however rigorously independent they are in their judgments concerning specific issues. 
Market efficiency and market completion theories can help reassure major financial institutions’ top executives that they must in some subtle way be doing God’s work, even when it looks at first sight as if some of their trading is simply speculation. 
Regulators need to hire industry experts to regulate effectively; but industry experts are almost bound to share the industry’s implicit assumptions. 
Understanding these social and cultural processes could itself be an important focus of new research. 
But we should not underplay the importance of ideology. 
Sophisticated human institutions – such as those that form the policymaking and regulatory system – are impossible to manage without a set of ideas that are sufficiently complex and internally consistent to be intellectually credible, but simple enough to provide a workable basis for day-to-day decision-making. 
Such guiding philosophies are most compelling when they provide clear answers. 
And a philosophy that asserts that financial innovation, market completion, and increased market liquidity are always and axiomatically beneficial provides a clear basis for regulatory decentralization. 
Here, I suspect, is where the greatest challenge for the future lies. 
For, while the simplified pre-crisis conventional wisdom appeared to provide a complete set of answers resting on a unified intellectual system and methodology, really good economic thinking must provide multiple partial insights, based on varied analytical approaches. 
Let us hope that practical men and women will learn that lesson. 
The Usual Suspect 
BERKELEY – Across the Euro-Atlantic world, recovery from the recession of 2008-2009 remains sluggish and halting, turning what was readily curable cyclical unemployment into structural unemployment. 
And what was a brief hiccup in the process of capital accumulation has turned into a prolonged investment shortfall, which means a lower capital stock and a lower level of real GDP not just today, while the recovery is incomplete, but possibly for decades. 
One legacy of Western Europe’s experience in the 1980’s is a rule of thumb: each year that lower labor-force attachment and reduced capital stock as a result of declining investment depresses production $100 billion below normal implies that productive potential at full employment in future years will be $10 billion below what would otherwise have been forecast. 
The fiscal implications of this are striking. 
Suppose that the United States or the Western European core economies boost their government purchases for next year by $100 billion. 
Suppose further that their central banks, while unwilling to extend themselves further in unconventional monetary policy, are also unwilling to stymie elected governments’ policies by offsetting their efforts to stimulate their economies. 
In that case, a simple constant-monetary-conditions multiplier indicates that we can expect roughly $150 billion of extra GDP. 
That boost, in turn, generates $50 billion of extra tax revenue, implying a net addition to the national debt of only $50 billion. 
What is the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate that the US or Western European core economies will have to pay on that extra $50 billion of debt? 
If it is 1%, boosting demand and production by $150 billion next year means that $500 million must be raised each year in the future to keep the debt from growing in real terms. 
If it is 3%, the required increase in annual tax revenues rises to $1.5 billion a year. 
If it is 5%, the government will need an additional $2.5 billion per year. 
Assuming that continued subnormal output casts a 10% shadow on future potential output levels, that extra $150 billion of production means that in the future, when the economy has recovered, there will be an extra $15 billion of output – and an extra $5 billion of tax revenue. 
Governments will not have to raise taxes to finance extra debt taken on to fund fiscal boosts. 
Instead, the supply-side boost to potential output over the long run from expansionary fiscal policy would be highly likely not only to pay for the additional debt needed to finance the spending boost, but also to allow for additional future tax cuts while still balancing the budget. 
Now this is, to say the least, a highly unusual situation. 
Normally, the multipliers applied to expansions in government purchases are much less than 1.5, because the central bank does not maintain constant monetary conditions as government spending expands, but rather acts to keep the economy on track to meet the monetary authority’s inflation target. 
A more usual multiplier is the monetary-policy offset multiplier of 0.5 or zero. 
Moreover, in a normal situation, governments – even the US government and those in Western Europe – cannot run up the national debt and still pay a real interest rate of 1%, or even 3%. 
Normally, the math of increasing government purchases tells us that a small or dubious boost to output today brings a heavier financing burden in the future, which makes debt-financed fiscal expansion a bad idea. 
But the situation today is not usual at all. 
Today the global economy is, as Ricardo Cabellero of MIT stresses, still desperately short of safe assets. 
Investors worldwide are willing to pay extraordinarily high prices for, and accept extraordinarily low interest rates on, core-economy debt, for they value as an extraordinary benefit having a safe asset that they can use as collateral. 
Right now, investors’ preference for safety makes financing additional government debt abnormally cheap, while the long-run shadows cast by prolonged subnormal production and employment make the current sluggish recovery predictably costly. 
Given the need to mobilize idle resources in the short run in order to maintain productive potential in the long run, a larger national debt would be, as Alexander Hamilton, the first US treasury secretary, put it, a national blessing. 
The Vagina Chronicles 
NEW YORK – Has there really been a sexual revolution? 
One of the themes that I explore in my new book, Vagina: A New Biography, is that the West’s supposedly sexually liberated societies, in which sexual images and content are available everywhere, have not really been all that liberating for women. 
Many of the reactions to my book tend to confirm that belief. 
Many responses were positive: the book is Publishers Weekly’s top science book of the fall. 
But the tone of some of the criticism – from “mystic woo-woo about the froo froo” to “bad news for everybody who has one” – suggests that even a culture in which millions of women are devouring a novel about sadomasochism, Fifty Shades of Grey, still has problems discussing women’s sexuality in a positive, empowering way. 
We need to have that conversation. 
Around the world, many women are targeted because of their sexuality: they are genitally mutilated, married off as children, raped with impunity, stoned for “fornication” and other sexual offenses, and told that their desire makes them sinful and worthy of abuse. 
Natasha Walter, who works with refugee women in London, reports that most of the persecution they are fleeing is sexual – and that the law does not validate the grounds for their asylum applications. 
Our societies do not take seriously women’s sexual integrity or crimes against it. 
The modern history of female sexuality has been plagued with misinformation, embarrassment, and sexual frustration. 
When Shere Hite published The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality in 1976, about one-third of the US women surveyed reported that they did not have orgasms during sex when they wished to. 
Hite’s important assertion that there is more to female sexual response than penetration triggered a wave of information about female sexuality. 
Although The Hite Report initially spurred great controversy, in the end it was broadly accepted that women’s pleasure and sexual well-being mattered and deserved respectful inquiry. 
But, in the past four decades, we have veered from informed discussion about women and their bodies into a raunchy culture of celebrity sex videos and zipless hookups in which women’s desire, arousal, and satisfaction – let alone their (or men’s) emotional needs – rarely play a part. 
Even in this “enlightened” age, many find it difficult to acknowledge new scientific data showing that female sexuality does not diminish or weaken women, but strengthens them in some ways – whoever they are, of whatever age or sexual orientation, whether alone or in relationships. 
Some critics have been upset by my argument that the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is related to motivation, focus, and reward, is part of what can make sexual pleasure empowering for women. 
This argument is based on the latest science about dopamine’s role in arousal (as James Pfaus and his team at Concordia University in Montreal have documented), as well as on well-established summaries of the literature, such as David Linden’s The Compass of Pleasure. 
This research indicates that positively experienced mind states are boosted when women are supported by the society in which they live and allow themselves to think about and anticipate rewarding sexual experience. 
(They are inhibited, of course, when women fear being stoned, mocked, shamed, raped or brutalized in response to their desire). 
Similarly, a rich body of data, including many important studies by Alessandra Rellini and Cindy Meston, now links women’s arousal to their autonomic nervous systems (Rellini and Meston have even found that rape can affect women’s baseline ANS years after the assault). 
These and other studies link female arousal to women’s freedom from “bad stress” and support in relaxation – and in their having some sense of control over events affecting them. 
In other words, if you want a woman to wish enthusiastically to sleep with you for the rest of her life, you must act as a teammate on the issues that affect her stress levels. 
That is nothing if not a “feminist” validation of many women’s intuitive experiences and needs. 
In fact, female and male sexual response differs in important ways: the length of response cycles, the role of “bad stress,” and the complexity of pelvic neural wiring (which in men is fairly standard, but in women is highly variegated and individualized). 
This finding should help women be less judgmental about the unique nature of their sexual responses. 
Here is one statistic that says it all: The Association of Reproductive Health Professionals claims that 30% of women do not reach orgasm regularly when they wish to, a proportion that has not budged since The Hite Report. 
Moreover, while findings vary, some estimates put the prevalence rate of “hypoactive sexual desire disorder”– a loss of libido – at about one-third of American women. 
The fact that science is finding connections between women’s sexual experience and their emotions and perception should not be cause for mockery, but for curiosity and respectful investigation of the facts. 
There are plenty of data on male sexuality and the male brain, and sound new science on the mind-body connection is transforming medical practice, from cardiology’s use of meditation to the use of talk therapies in treating breast cancer. 
If we respect both female sexuality and the female mind, surely we should not fear discussing the connections between the two that scientific research is uncovering. 
It seems odd to me that one would have to make a case for this in 2012. 
The Value of a Pale Blue Dot 
Melbourne – The eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote: “Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence, the more often and more steadily we meditate upon them: the starry firmament above and the moral law within.” 
This year, the 400th anniversary of Galileo’s first use of a telescope, has been declared the International Year of Astronomy, so this seems a good time to ponder Kant’s first source of “awe and reverence.” 
Indeed, the goal of the commemoration – to help the world’s citizens “rediscover their place in the universe” – now has the incidental benefit of distracting us from nasty things nearer to home, like swine flu and the global financial crisis. 
What does astronomy tell us about “the starry firmament above”? 
By expanding our grasp of the vastness of the universe, science has, if anything, increased the awe and reverence we feel when we look up on a starry night (assuming, that is, that we have got far enough away from air pollution and excessive street lighting to see the stars properly). 
But, at the same time, our greater knowledge surely forces us to acknowledge that our place in the universe is not particularly significant. 
In his essay “Dreams and Facts,” the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that our entire Milky Way galaxy is a tiny fragment of the universe, and within this fragment our solar system is “an infinitesimal speck,” and within this speck “our planet is a microscopic dot.” 
Today, we don’t need to rely on such verbal descriptions of our planet’s insignificance against the background of our galaxy. 
The astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that the Voyager space probe capture an image of earth as it reached the outer reaches of our solar system. 
It did so, in 1990, and Earth shows up in a grainy image as a pale blue dot. 
If you go to YouTube and search for “Carl Sagan – Pale Blue Dot,” you can see it, and hear Sagan himself telling us that we must cherish our world because everything humans have ever valued exists only on that pale blue dot. 
That is a moving experience, but what should we learn from it? 
Russell sometimes wrote as if the fact that we are a mere speck in a vast universe showed that we don’t really matter all that much: “On this dot, tiny lumps of impure carbon and water, of complicated structure, with somewhat unusual physical and chemical properties, crawl about for a few years, until they are dissolved again into the elements of which they are compounded.” 
But no such nihilistic view of our existence follows from the size of our planetary home, and Russell himself was no nihilist. 
He thought that it was important to confront the fact of our insignificant place in the universe, because he did not want us to live under the illusory comfort of a belief that somehow the world had been created for our sake, and that we are under the benevolent care of an all-powerful creator. “Dreams and Facts” concludes with these stirring words: “No man is liberated from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it is; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is capable until he has allowed himself to see his own littleness.” 
After World War II, when the world was divided into nuclear-armed camps threatening each other with mutual destruction, Russell did not take the view that our insignificance, when considered against the vastness of the universe, meant that the end of life on Earth did not matter. 
On the contrary, he made nuclear disarmament the chief focus of his political activity for the remainder of his life. 
Sagan took a similar view. While seeing the Earth as a whole diminishes the importance of things like national boundaries that divide us, he said, it also “underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.” 
Al Gore used the “pale blue dot” image at the end of his film, An Inconvenient Truth, suggesting that if we wreck this planet, we have nowhere else to go. 
That’s probably true, even though scientists are now discovering other planets outside our solar system. 
Perhaps one day we will find that we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe, and perhaps we will be able to discuss issues of interspecies ethics with such beings. 
The Value of Being Undervalued 
The paramount policy dilemma that emerging markets face nowadays is this: on the one hand, sustained economic growth requires a competitive (read “undervalued”) currency. 
On the other hand, any good news is immediately followed by currency appreciation, making the task of remaining competitive that much harder. 
So, you finally passed that crucial piece of legislation? 
Your fiscally responsible political party just won the election? 
Or your commodity exports hit the jackpot? 
Good for you! 
But the currency appreciation that follows will likely set off an unsustainable consumption boom, wreak havoc with your export sector, create unemployment, and sap your growth potential. 
Success brings its reward in the form of immediate punishment! 
In response, central banks may intervene in currency markets to prevent appreciation, at the cost of accumulating low-yield foreign reserves and diverting themselves from their primary goal of price stability. 
This is the strategy followed by countries such as China and Argentina. 
Or the central bank lets the markets go where they will, at the cost of drawing the ire of business, labor, the rest of the government, and, in fact, practically everyone except financial types. 
This is the strategy pursued by countries such as Turkey and South Africa, which have adopted more conventional “inflation targeting” regimes. 
The first strategy is problematic because it is unsustainable. 
The second is undesirable because it buys stability at the cost of growth. 
The importance of a competitive currency for economic growth is undeniable. 
Virtually every instance of sustained high growth has been accompanied by a significantly depreciated real exchange rate. 
This is as true of South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960’s and 1970’s, as it is of Argentina today. 
Chile made its transition to high growth in the 1980’s on the back of a large depreciation. 
Since the 1990’s, both China and India have received a huge boost from their undervalued currencies. 
These are just some of the better-known examples. 
Looking at the experience of more than 100 countries, I have found in my research that each 10% undervaluation adds 0.3 percentage points to growth. 
Currency undervaluation is such a potent instrument for growth for the simple reason that it creates incentives for the economy’s growth-promoting sectors. 
It increases the profitability of manufacturing and non-traditional agricultural sectors, which are the activities with both the highest level of labor productivity and with the most rapid rates of productivity increase. 
An undervalued currency enables an economy to integrate into the world economy on the basis of strong export performance. 
It stimulates production (and hence employment), unlike overvaluation, which stimulates consumption. 
So what should policymakers do? 
First, it is important to realize that a strong and overly volatile currency is not just the central bank’s problem to fix. 
While the central bank bears a good part of the responsibility, it needs support from other parts of the government, most notably from the finance ministry. 
Maintaining a competitive currency requires a rise in domestic saving relative to investment, or a reduction in national expenditure relative to income. 
Otherwise, the competitiveness gains would be offset by rising inflation. 
This means that the fiscal authorities have a big responsibility: to target a structural fiscal surplus that is high enough to generate the space needed for real exchange rate depreciation. 
This may not be popular, especially in an economic downturn. 
But no one has the right to complain about the central bank’s “high-interest rate, appreciated currency” policy when fiscal policy remains too lax for interest rates to be reduced without risking price stability. 
There are other instruments available for increasing domestic saving and reducing consumption besides the fiscal balance. 
Government policies can target private saving directly, by creating incentives for saving through appropriate tax and pension policies. 
Even more importantly, policies can discourage foreign-borrowing-led consumption booms by taxing capital inflows (Chilean-style) or increasing financial intermediaries’ liquidity requirements. 
There is little to be gained from letting hot money flow into an economy freely. 
With such policies in place, the comfort zone for central banks is enlarged sufficiently to loosen monetary policy. 
Equally important, the central bank needs to signal to the public that it now cares about the real exchange rate, because it is important to exports, jobs, and sustainable growth. 
This can be done without announcing a specific target level for the exchange rate. 
There is huge room to maneuver between the extremes of targeting a specific level of the real exchange rate and disowning any interest in the real exchange rate. 
The central bank does need to have a view, updated over time, about the exchange rate’s appropriate range, and it should signal when it thinks the currency is moving in the wrong direction. 
Once the monetary rules of the game incorporate the real exchange rate, and assuming that fiscal policy remains supportive, investors can look forward to a less volatile and more competitive currency. 
This will mean more investment in tradable industries, more employment overall, and faster growth. 
You will know you have succeeded when the United States’ Treasury Secretary comes knocking on your door saying that you are guilty of manipulating your currency. 
The Value of European Values 
Europe's leaders have revived the constitutional talks that broke down last December in a dispute about voting rights. 
Such disputes are, of course, subject to compromises, which are likely to be found. 
What still needs to be settled is a clear understanding of what the constitution is meant to achieve. 
Two fundamental principles have underpinned European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity. 
Both principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and law. 
For years they have been present in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which quotes them in the Preamble), in the recent draft Constitution. 
They are, in short, inscribed in the EU's history and ideals. 
But what do solidarity and subsidiarity really mean? 
Consider solidarity, which is open to at least two interpretations: static solidarity, which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, which concerns the production of income and wealth as well. 
In the postwar history of European integration, dynamic solidarity was strong in the first period - that of the European Coal and Steel Community - both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) and in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome. 
This does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed: European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of it. 
Some countries did not immediately benefit from the euro, but accepted it for the sake of solidarity. They were convinced that it would have positive effects in the long run. 
Dynamic solidarity, in other words, means favoring policies that foster investment, innovation, economic growth, and employment. 
However, as GDP growth in the EU indicates, dynamic solidarity has been undermined over the last decade. 
What is particularly worrying is the research and development lag. 
Realization of the EU's so-called Lisbon strategy, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world's most competitive economy, is threatened by a growing emphasis on static solidarity, reflected in high social welfare costs and the high taxes needed to finance them. 
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population, which, along with slower growth, has led to structural fiscal imbalances. 
One of the biggest challenges for the future of the EU is addressing today's prevalence of static solidarity oriented towards old people over dynamic solidarity favoring young people. 
After all, the Union cannot afford to permit current consumption to continue to prevail over the investment needed to ensure future prosperity. 
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that it, too, has two interpretations: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity. 
Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers among different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions, and municipalities. 
The best-known application of this principle is federalism. 
In the European Treaties, we find a clear expression of vertical subsidiarity. 
But is this enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional settings of the Union? 
Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings, as well as social and economic powers. 
It encompasses the relations between state, society, and market. 
But society and the market have their own rights and sovereignties that are not granted by the state. 
So the problem comes in assuring the autonomy of each realm. 
An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the internal European market, which created a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms because they are no longer protected by national governments. 
Horizontal subsidiarity means that in both society and the economic sphere, the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be respected to the greatest possible extent. 
It also means that support must be given by a "superior power" whenever individual freedom and responsibility do not suffice to achieve the ends necessary for human dignity. 
This support, however, should be implemented in ways that the natural potential of individuals, society, and the market is promoted. 
But that is possible only when the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly formulated, which it has not been in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or the work of the European Convention. 
In short, solidarity has come to mean redistribution rather than growth (which is how today's generation expresses solidarity with respect to future generations), while subsidiarity has come to mean the distribution of political power, rather than a careful delineation of the boundaries between the state, civil society, and the market. 
Today, both values are defined in ways that favor the state. 
Indeed, focusing on market-based growth has often been identified with the semi-alien values of America. 
But these values are deeply ingrained in Europe, and should be brought out again. 
The EU should restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity that is more balanced in favor of the market and society, and that reduces the state's socio-economic influence. 
State institutions should deliver public goods (like defense, justice, and fiscal and monetary policy), society should deliver social goods (like culture, education, and assistance to needy people), and the market should deliver economic goods (which are connected with profits, growth, and employment). 
In the 21st century, Europe must reconsider the value of both principles - solidarity and subsidiarity - if it is to attain integration's historic goal: the freedom and well being needed to overcome the differences and political divisions that incited tragedy in the 20th century. 
That is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written. 
Race-Based Medicine? 
PALO ALTO – Race can undoubtedly be a tricky subject, with any suggestion of genetic differences among racial groups – beyond superficial characteristics like skin color – potentially invoking memories of the nineteenth-century eugenics movement and its eventual role in Nazi ideology. Now, with drug companies increasingly seeking to develop medications that target particular racial groups, the long-taboo subject of racial genetics has reemerged. 
Much of the current debate centers on whether race should be a criterion for inclusion in clinical trials – and, by extension, whether drug labeling should mention race specifically. 
Although the issues are complicated, the solution is simple: follow the data. 
In fact, clinical trials are not intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of a treatment (drug, medical device, or other intervention) in a completely random sample from the general population. 
Rather, researchers “enrich” the study population by using a characteristic, such as age or laboratory-test results, to select a subset of patients in whom the intervention’s effects will likely be easier to detect than they would be in an unfiltered population. 
In recent years, “biomarkers,” such as certain DNA sequences or the presence of a particular drug receptor, have become increasingly important indicators for determining eligibility for clinical trials. 
This approach is not new. 
For example, scientists have known for decades that certain drugs can cause severe and precipitous anemia in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme G6PD. 
More recently, researchers have learned that certain cancer drugs are ineffective in fighting tumors containing the mutated variant of the gene KRAS. 
Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit. 
Enrichment thus enables researchers to strengthen clinical trials’ “statistical power,” that is, the probability of detecting differences, if any exist, between study groups. 
Given that a larger number of subjects or iterations enhances an experiment’s ability to detect all of the relevant effects, which bolsters confidence in the result, outcomes of small studies tend to imply significant uncertainty – unless the intervention’s effects are potent. 
Enrichment allows researchers to perform smaller, more informative trials by helping them to design studies that will show a high “relative treatment difference” between the drug and whatever it is being compared to (often a placebo, but sometimes another treatment). 
In the 1980’s, a biomarker contributed to the success of the small but seminal clinical trial of human growth hormone in children who were unable to produce it naturally. 
Some children lose the ability to make growth hormone due to injury or tumors; others lack normal growth-hormone activity from birth, owing to a genetic mutation; and others are missing the gene that codes for the hormone altogether. 
Giving the latter group exogenous growth hormone is futile, because their immune systems react to the “foreign” protein by producing antibodies. Although the hormone may stimulate growth for a short period, the antibodies soon bind and neutralize it. 
By limiting the study population to children in the other two groups, for whom exogenous growth hormone stimulates normal growth, researchers achieved a 100% relative treatment difference. In other words, every subject who received the active drug responded, and none of those who received the placebo did. 
Clearly, genetic markers are useful in designing clinical trials. 
But are more subjective factors like race or ethnicity also relevant? 
For the cardiac drug BiDil (a combination of the vasodilators hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate), the answer is yes. 
In 1996, inconclusive clinical trials led US regulators to reject the drug. 
But when more detailed analysis of the data revealed potentially elevated benefits for black patients, a new trial was performed on 1,050 self-identified “black” patients with severe heart failure for whom available treatments had proved ineffective. 
The results – a 43% reduction in mortality and a 39% decrease in hospital visits among patients who received BiDil – were so striking that the study was concluded early. 
Although BiDil has not been a great commercial success since its approval in 2009, it remains on the market. 
Some regard race-based medical treatment as necessary to reduce health disparities, while others view it as downright discriminatory. 
When BiDil was approved, Francis Collins, who was Director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute at the time, warned that “we should move without delay from blurry and potentially misleading surrogates for drug response, such as race, to the more specific causes.” 
Of course, Collins was correct; race is a crude and incomplete mechanism for understanding genetic differences. 
But we must fight illness with the data we have, not the data we wish we had. Political and ethical sensitivities notwithstanding, drug testing, approval, and labeling must go wherever the evidence leads. 
The Vanished Intellectual 
This spring marks the centenary of the birth of two all-round intellectuals, those ideological avatars of the Cold War era, Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre. 
Aron was born on March 14, 1905, Sartre on June 21. 
Sartre and Aron began their 50-year acquaintance with a shared elite French education that included a formative period in Germany just before the rise of Nazism. 
Each in his inimitable way displayed the contrariness both loved and loathed in intellectuals: Aron fancied Anglo-American liberalism before it became fashionable, while Sartre remained a Communist sympathiser after the fashion had passed. 
Aron wrote cool, sleek prose about the most heated geopolitical conflicts, while Sartre could turn any triviality into an existential crisis. 
Yet they often stood together against the French political establishment. 
Both joined the Resistance when France was a Nazi puppet state, and both called for Algerian independence after France regained its sovereignty. 
Unfortunately, Sartre and Aron are also joined in death: both have been disowned, ignored, or underrated by all the academic disciplines – philosophy, literature, sociology, politics – to which their voluminous works might be thought to have contributed. 
Silenced by death, Sartre and Aron are remembered more for the attitudes they brought to whatever they wrote about than for what they actually said. 
Theirs is a fate perennially suffered by intellectuals. 
Great intellectuals like Abelard, Erasmus, Galileo, Voltaire, Zola, and Russell each challenged the pieties of his era, and we now regard their success as a good thing. 
But most of us are likely to recoil at the methods they used in their work as intellectuals: caricature, deception, and even fabrication. 
Consider three examples. 
Abelard is credited with the introduction of theology as a critical discipline in Christianity. 
Yet, he did so by juxtaposing contradictory quotes taken out of context, showing that neither the Bible nor the Church fathers speak in one voice and that readers must decide for themselves. 
Similarly, Galileo is now known to have committed what we now call “research fraud” in his famed physical experiments. 
Assuming he conducted them at all, they very probably did not produce the neat results that he used to assail his opponents. 
As for Zola, who defended Captain Alfred Dreyfus from charges of treason fueled by anti-Semitism, he was easily convicted for libel because he merely questioned the motives of witnesses without offering any new evidence. 
All three were subsequently vindicated – sometimes in their lifetimes, sometimes not. 
What they shared is a paradoxical ethic common to all intellectuals: the end cause of truth justifies whatever means happens to be at your disposal. 
This is because the whole truth is rarely what passes for the truth at any moment. 
Such an ethic is abhorrent in today’s world, where knowledge is parceled out to academic disciplines like bits of real estate. 
To an intellectual, an academic may look like someone who mistakes the means of inquiry for its end. 
But to academics, intellectuals look like ramblers freely trespassing on other people’s property, picking the fruits and despoiling the soil. 
Intellectuals differ from ordinary academics in holding that the truth is best approached not by producing new knowledge, but by destroying old belief. 
When the Enlightenment philosophers renovated the old Christian slogan, “The truth shall set you free,” they imagined a process of opening doors, not building barricades. 
In short, intellectuals want their audiences to think for themselves, not simply shift allegiances from one expert to another. 
The intellectual’s ethic is both exhilarating and harsh, for it places responsibility for thinking squarely on the thinker’s shoulders. 
Every act of deference thus becomes an abdication of one’s own intellectual authority. 
The slogan “Knowledge is power” may be familiar, but only intellectuals see its full implications. 
Obviously, greater knowledge enhances our capacity to act. 
What is much less obvious is that such empowerment requires the destruction of socially sanctioned knowledge. 
Only then is a society’s space for decision opened up, enabling its members to move in many more directions than previously deemed possible. 
Aron and Sartre developed contrasting, but equally controversial, styles of destroying received belief. 
Aron preferred demonizing fellow intellectuals as alarmists than conceding that the Cold War might eventuate in a nuclear holocaust. 
Sartre castigated those who failed to resist oppression when they could have, while excusing those who enforced oppression given the chance. 
Aron exaggerated the power of reason, while Sartre inflated the power of action. 
Each wanted to take French society in radically different directions, but both never ceased being critical of the status quo. 
In the end, the two appear to have thought both in and out of their time. 
While this makes them awkward candidates for any academic discipline, such is the ambivalence of any intellectual’s legacy. 
The Vanishing Bomb 
WARSAW – The agreement by the American and Russian presidents to renew strategic arms reductions has revived hope for the global abolition of nuclear arms. 
The urgency can hardly be exaggerated: nuclear weapons may come into the possession of states that might use them, as well as of stateless terrorists – creating new threats of unimaginable proportion. 
A noble dream just several years ago, the elimination of nuclear arms is no longer the idea only of populists and pacifists; it has now been adopted by professionals – politicians known for their realism and academics known for their sense of responsibility. 
The invention of nuclear weapons – which served the goal of deterrence during the Cold War, when the world was divided into two opposing blocs – answered the needs and risks of the time. 
Security rested on a balance of fear, as reflected in the concept of mutually assured destruction. 
In that bipolar world, nuclear weapons were held by only five global powers, all permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
Today, the global picture is different. 
Sparked by Poland’s Solidarity movement, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and the bipolar world and its East-West divide vanished. 
An order based on the dangerous doctrine of mutual deterrence, was not, however, replaced with a system founded on cooperation and interdependence. 
Destabilization and chaos followed, accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability. 
Nuclear weapons are now also held by three states engaged in conflicts: India, Pakistan, and Israel. 
Given the development of the nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, they, too, may become nuclear-weapon states. 
There is also a real danger that this group may expand further to include states where governments will not always be guided by rational considerations. 
There is also the risk that nuclear weapons may fall into the hands of non-state actors, such as terrorist groups. 
An effective non-proliferation regime will not be possible unless the major nuclear powers, especially the United States and Russia, take urgent steps toward nuclear disarmament. 
Together, they hold nearly 25,000 nuclear warheads – 96% of the global nuclear arsenal. 
It gives us hope that US President Barack Obama recognizes these dangers. 
We note with satisfaction that the new US administration has not turned a deaf ear to responsible statesmen and scientists who are calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons. 
Indeed, the goal of a nuclear-free world was incorporated in the US administration’s arms control and disarmament agenda. 
We appreciate the proposals from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany as well, while Russia also signaled recently in Geneva its readiness to embark upon nuclear disarmament. 
Opponents of nuclear disarmament used to argue that this goal was unattainable in the absence of an effective system of control and verification. 
But, today, appropriate means of control are available to the international community. 
Of key importance are the nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
The world must have guarantees that civilian nuclear reactors will not be used for military purposes – a condition for non-nuclear-weapon states’ unrestricted access to nuclear technologies, as proposed recently by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his initiative on a global nuclear bargain for our times. 
This is especially urgent now, with the search for new energy sources and a “renaissance” of nuclear power. 
The 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference calls for an urgent formulation of priorities. 
The Preparatory Committee will meet in New York this May, and this is where the necessary decisions should be made. 
The main expectations are for a reduction of nuclear armaments, a cutback in the number of launch-ready warheads (de-alerting), negotiations on a Fissile Materials Cut-off Treaty, ratification of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, and other means of strengthening practical implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, especially its universal adoption. 
The time has come for a fundamental change in the proceedings of the Geneva-based Disarmament Conference, which for years has failed to meet the international community’s expectations. 
We share the view expressed by the academics, politicians, and experts of the international Warsaw Reflection Group that consideration should be given to the zero option as a basis for a future multilateral nuclear disarmament agreement. 
The Group’s report, Arms Control Revisited: Non-proliferation and Denuclearization , elaborated under the chairmanship of Adam D. Rotfeld of Poland and drafted by the British scholar Ian Anthony of SIPRI, was based on contributions by security analysts from nuclear powers and Poland, as well as from countries previously in possession of nuclear weapons (South Africa) and post-Soviet countries where they were once stored (Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine). 
The fact that these states were denuclearized as part of the Safe and Secure Disarmament program provides a valuable lesson. 
The process of gradual nuclear disarmament must be set in motion. 
It will not produce results overnight, but it would give us a sense of direction, a chance to strengthen non-proliferation mechanisms, and an opportunity to establish a global, cooperative non-nuclear security system. 
The deadliest threat to global security comes from a qualitatively new wave of nuclear proliferation. 
The heaviest responsibility is shouldered by the powers that hold the largest arsenals. 
We trust that the US and Russian presidents, and leaders of all other nuclear powers, will show statesmanlike wisdom and courage and begin the process of freeing the world from the nuclear menace. 
But as important as this goal is for international order and security, of equal importance is respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, as well as the establishment, on a global scale, of democracy and the rule of law. 
The Vanishing Swedish Exception? 
For the past two years, Western Europe's voters have been turning rightward. 
In Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Portugal, concerns about immigration, chronic unemployment, high taxes, and deteriorating public services have fuelled this trend. 
But as Europe's most recent parliamentary election shows, Sweden's Social Democrats--in power for 61 of the past 70 years--remain relatively immune to serious challenges from the right. 
Opinion polls just a few months ago gave the Social Democrats 44% popular support. 
Together with the former Communists and the Greens, the left held a comfortable 12-15% lead over the four non-socialist parties. 
This margin shrank dramatically during the campaign, and the left retained power by the skin of its teeth, but the lead ultimately proved insurmountable. 
Why has Sweden held out against the right-wing tide sweeping so much of Western Europe? 
The immediate reason for Social Democracy's enduring appeal is foreign policy. 
In early 2001, Sweden held the EU presidency, giving Prime Minister Göran Persson, the country's dominant politician, a bright spotlight in which to shine. 
The Social Democrats also benefited by supporting the US after the September 11 th terrorist attacks--a popular position that thus pre-empted the non-socialist opposition. 
Persson exudes competence and authority. 
He bolstered his image considerably after winning the 1994 election by tightening government finances and eliminating a huge fiscal deficit. 
But he has done nothing remarkable since winning again in 1998. 
Sweden's economy rose and fell with the IT bubble, reflected in telecoms giant Ericsson's troubles today. 
Persson's main advantages entering this year's campaign were that he was unencumbered by new promises and was well equipped to run a presidential-style contest based on his personal appeal. 
But force of character cannot mask real problems and a changing political agenda. 
Although foreigners often idealize Sweden's welfare state, its economy has been losing ground steadily for 30 years. 
In 1970, GDP per head was the fourth highest in the world; now it is 17 th place in the OECD. 
Every year Sweden attains 1% less growth on average than the rest of the West. 
The decline has been gradual, so it fails to alarm voters, but Swedes certainly notice it when they go abroad. 
One reason for this relative malaise is that Sweden remains the world leader in taxation, with public expenditures claiming nearly 60% of GDP. 
Conservatives demand lower taxes, but this is unpopular: almost 65% of Swedes live on public salaries or social transfers. 
Unlike other Europeans, Swedes are thus much keener to keep taxes high, which guarantees a large left-wing vote. 
Even so, Swedes fret about the deteriorating quality of services provided by the social welfare system. 
They complain about year-long waits for eye operations and hip surgery--a direct result of a Social Democratic reform of 1994 that abolished the right of patients to seek alternative care at public expense if they are not treated within three months by their regional council. 
The Social Democrats shrewdly reversed themselves on this point during this year's campaign, but health care entitlements have clearly gone too far. 
No less than 14% of Swedish employees are currently registered as sick, double the number five years ago. 
The Social Democrats argue that this reflects a serious health problem, while non-socialists suggest that the system is defective. 
Many Swedes have come to believe that it is their right to register as sick regardless of their health . 
No other evidence suggests that public health is actually declining. 
Deteriorating public education poses another worry. 
Stockholm, ruled by conservatives and liberals, has extended its free-market experiments, such as privatization of subway trains, to education vouchers and free choice of alternative schools. 
The Social Democrats lost miserably in the capital. 
As in most recent European elections, immigration loomed large, but as usual, Sweden was out of step with other countries. 
The small Liberal party, which campaigned in favor of free labor immigration, tripled its support. 
The Liberals make the sensible argument that anybody with a job should get a work visa, but that knowledge of Swedish be a citizenship requirement and that unemployed immigrants be barred from receiving social benefits for five years. 
Roughly 70% of Swedes support free immigration of laborers--far higher than elsewhere in Europe. 
They see that immigrants tend to be qualified East Europeans, many of them physicians, while the number of Swedes registered as sick or in early retirement has underpinned a severe labor shortage. 
But Prime Minister Persson, kowtowing to the trade unions, insists on blocking labor immigration altogether for the next decade. 
Although this stance cost the Social Democrats many votes, it was hardly enough to offset their main electoral advantage: the unseemly control over key public goods that the party has accumulated during its long incumbency. 
For example, the two dominant state-owned TV channels are under strict Social Democratic supervision, and the party also controls professorial appointments and academic research through politicization of funding agencies and university boards. 
After so many years of Social Democratic rule, a large political caste has also developed. 
The main qualification of two current ministers is that their parents were ministers. 
The party itself is awash in trade union money, which is exempt from taxation as a result of sheer cronyism. 
But Swedes have shown that still like the welfare state. 
While they worry about the quality of public services, they are not prepared to join Europe's rightist revival. 
So Sweden's Social Democrats don't have to concede much to remain remarkably strong--even if this weakens the integrity of Swedish democracy. 
The Varieties of Unemployment 
BERKELEY – We hear from surprisingly many quarters these days that governments in Europe and North America, and their central banks, should give up on the expansionary policies they have pursued to try to create jobs. 
The high unemployment currently afflicting the North Atlantic, critics of government stimulus maintain, is not cyclical but “structural,” and thus cannot be alleviated by policies that boost aggregate demand. 
Let me be the first to say that structural unemployment is a true and severe danger. 
When people who in other circumstances could be happy, healthy, and productive members of the workforce lack the skills, confidence, social networks, and experience needed to find work worth paying for, we obviously have a problem. 
And if unemployment in Europe and North America stays elevated for two or three more years, it is highly likely that we will have to face it. 
For nothing converts cyclical unemployment into structural unemployment more certainly than prolonged unemployment. 
But is that true today? 
Does it look right now as if the biggest problem facing the economies of Europe and North America is structural unemployment? 
It does not. 
Let us remember what structural unemployment looks like. 
The economy is depressed and unemployment is high not because of slack aggregate demand generated by a collapse in spending, but instead because “structural” factors have produced a mismatch between the skills of the labor force and the distribution of demand. 
The structure of demand by consumers is different from the jobs that workers are capable of filling. 
For example, suppose that you have many workers qualified and skilled to work in construction, but households have decided that their houses are more than large enough, and wish to fill them with manufactured goods. 
This would produce structural unemployment to the extent that the ex-construction workers could not do things in manufacturing that would make it worthwhile for manufacturing firms to hire them. 
In that case, we would expect to see construction depressed: firms closed, capital goods idle, and workers unemployed. 
But we would also expect to see manufacturing plants running at double shifts – the money not spent on construction has to go somewhere, and, remember, the problem is not a lack of aggregate demand. 
We would expect to see manufacturers holding job fairs, and when not enough workers showed up, we would expect to see manufacturers offering higher wages to attract workers into their plants, and then raising prices to cover their higher costs. 
The size and duration of the excess unemployment of ex-construction workers might be substantial and long lasting. 
It might require significant time to retrain construction workers and plug them into social networks in which they become good manufacturing workers. 
We might see prolonged and high unemployment in the construction sector, and in regions that had seen the biggest previous construction booms. 
But depression in the construction sector and unemployment among its ex-workers would be balanced by exuberance in the manufacturing sector, rising prices for manufactured goods, and long hours and high wages for manufacturing workers 
That is what “mismatch” structural unemployment looks like – and it is not what we have today, at least not in Europe and North America. 
In the past three years, employment in construction has shrunk, but so has employment in manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, information distribution and communications, professional and business services, educational services, leisure and hospitality, and in the public sector. 
Employment is up in health care, Internet-related businesses, and perhaps in logging and mining. 
In the United States, the past three years have seen employment fall from 137.8 million people in July 2007 to slightly less than 130 million in July 2010 – a decline of 7.9 million during a period in which the adult population grew by six million. 
What we have witnessed is not a shift in demand into sectors lacking an adequate number of qualified and productive workers, but rather a collapse in the level of aggregate demand. 
This may well look like structural unemployment in three years. 
In three years, we may well see labor shortages, rising wages, and increasing prices in expanding sectors, accompanied by high unemployment elsewhere in the economy. 
But that is not our problem now. 
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. 
The Veil Wars 
Across the world veiling has been making a comeback. 
Whether sheathed in scarves covering only the head (the so-called “hijabs”), the face and head (the “chador” and “burqa”), or the entire body, shrouded females are now visible in public places everywhere, from public schools and universities to parliaments. 
Why is this resurgence happening? 
Although the veil is supposedly grounded in tradition, its reappearance appears to be a response to today’s social and political instability. 
In Afghanistan and other parts of Asia the collapse of Communist regimes incited a rise in religious orthodoxy, as did the overthrow of the Shah in Iran. 
In Egypt and Saudi Arabia, indeed throughout the Middle East, the resurgence of veiling has many roots: some argue that it arose out of the Arab defeat in the 1967 war with Israel; others say it began with the disintegration of the dream of Arab unity. 
This connection to politics suggests even more strongly (as veiling is hardly mentioned in the Koran) that the practice is a social and religious construction: veiling allows for the creation of an instantaneous new political identity - a sort of “instant tradition” - which is particularly powerful when the veil is enforced by public sanction. 
This sanction can be achieved from the top down - ie, by government or other decrees reinterpreting Islamic tenets - as well as from the bottom up, through communal norms and social pressure. 
Where the impetus to “cover” comes welling up from below, from family and community, such veiling practices provoke countervailing state actions. 
In Turkey, the government banned headscarves in public schools and universities. 
Crackdowns have seen thousands of young women excluded from classes and even from receiving their degrees if they appear in headscarves. 
The headscarf has also been forbidden in Turkey’s parliament. 
Turkey’s highest courts rationalize these harsh measures against veiling by invoking the country’s constitutionally mandated secularism, which Kemal Ataturk imposed when he created modern Turkey out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. 
But in so infringing basic human rights to freedoms of association and expression to such a degree, Turkey’s restrictions on veiling are now, paradoxically, imperiling one of secular Turkey’s great ambitions: joining the European Union. 
Similar prohibitions on veils operate all around the region, and for much the same political reason - ie, to stave off Muslim political rule. 
In Egypt, for example, as in Tunisia and Uzbekistan, there are laws in place banning the full veil. 
Banning or restricting veils, however, is not confined to Muslim countries seeking to maintain a secular orientation in politics. 
In France, headscarves have been prohibited from public schools since the late 1980's, restrictions maintained despite the European Union’s concerns that Turkey’s curbs on veiling violate human rights. 
Headscarves were first banned in France by administrative decree. 
That ban was later upheld by the Constitutional Court, which argued that allowing such public religious expression would likely infringe on the “neutrality” of the public sphere, and so lead to “divisiveness.” 
Alas, such divisiveness already exists: public opinion opposing the veil is strident, but it appears to be less about religion than about racist xenophobia, anti-immigrant feelings, and resistance to multiculturalism. 
It also seems to contain within it fears about the potential erosion of French national identity. 
Given such pressures, the veil is a charged symbol across France. 
While these new veiling regimes - both for and against veiling - may advance the aim of consolidating political identities in times of flux, they do so by placing a disparate burden on women, undermining their rights to freedom of expression and association. 
But what can be done about it? 
If veiling injunctions that require women to wear veils seem draconian, it is by no means obvious that anti-veiling laws afford women any greater freedom. 
Indeed, when states repeal veiling regulations, authority over women often reverts to families and other community elders. 
For example, in Egypt in 1994, when the education minister banned primary school girls from wearing headscarfs, a strong backlash resulted and there followed a marked retrogression in women’s rights generally. 
Conversely, in France, many Muslim women say that they experience greater freedom when the state prohibits veiling because such laws allow them to disregard the mandates of their religious communities. 
Others argue that when the state forbids the veil, there is a net loss of freedom for women because wearing a veil - both historically and in current times - creates a buffer that allows women to circulate freely in society. 
Moreover, veils allow women greater access to secular institutions from which they would be precluded otherwise. 
In general, wearing a veil affords greater freedom to women in male dominated societies. 
Whether the veil is embraced or loathed, these veiling wars mark a vast, almost global battle about cultural and political identity. 
The veil, and the battles over it, also represents a culture war that is disproportionately played out on women’s bodies. 
In the context of a long tradition where women are held to stand for public virtue, it’s not surprising to find the battle exacerbated in places where political authority and legitimacy are frayed. 
After all, naked power usually seeks to hide behind a veil. 
The Velvet Delusion 
COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS – With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the relatively non-violent overthrow of communism throughout Central and Eastern Europe, optimists predicted a new golden age of a world filled with peaceful democracies. 
History, for some, seemed to have come to an end. 
But the optimists have proved to be misguided, as the world’s powers, great and small, drew their own, often conflicting, lessons from the past. 
For Americans, 1989 validated everything they already believed. 
They had won the Cold War, or so they perceived, through hard force and conviction. 
They saw demonstrators in East European capitals and Chinese crowds in Tiananmen Square chanting for freedom, and believed that those throngs wanted to be American. 
As George H.W. Bush declared, “We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.” 
Subsequent events seemed to validate this American recipe. 
The Gulf War confirmed American military might and the age-old perils of appeasement. 
The Clinton era gave us active democracy-promotion as the principle tool of American foreign policy, which George W. Bush’s administration took to unprecedented extremes. 
Cold War victory provided the answer for each. “America’s resolve and American ideals so clearly articulated by Ronald Reagan,” Clinton said, “helped to bring the Wall down.” 
The lesson was clear: “we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom.” 
Barack Obama’s words echo those of Clinton. Despite his frequent avowals of change, his central articulation of American policy seems remarkably static. 
“Earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks,” Obama preached in his famous campaign speech in Berlin, “but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.” 
This is why Obama’s America spends more on weaponry than the rest of the world combined, and why democracy-promotion remains the unquestioned foundation of American foreign policy, with debate possible only about its application. 
History offers a recipe for success, so long as Americans adhere to the lesson of 1989. 
But the rest of the world learned different lessons. 
European strategists largely dismissed America’s interpretation that force had won the Cold War, believing that cooperation had triumphed precisely because force was absent. 
They heard in pleas for freedom from behind the Iron Curtain not a desire to become American, but to join the remarkably successful European experiment in collective security and prosperity that emerged after World War II. 
For today’s European leaders, the central lesson of 1989 is that force is counterproductive; what matters is consensus. 
Russian leaders, not surprisingly, also drew their own conclusions. 
When Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of a “Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals,” his conception was not of a continent under Soviet domination, as Josef Stalin once threatened. 
Having demonstrated remarkable restraint in 1989, Russian leaders expected to be embraced by the West. 
Instead, NATO expanded to Russia’s doorstep, the European Union barred its doors, and membership in the World Trade Organization seemed out of reach. 
The post-Soviet economy crumbled, crime skyrocketed, and life expectancy declined. 
Russia’s voice in global affairs lost authority. 
For Russian leaders, 1989’s lesson was clear: trusting the West was foolish at best, dangerous at worst. 
Gorbachev’s vision of European inclusion neglected centuries of Russian history; the West did not want Russian participation. 
Better that Russians rely on their own power, develop their own resources, and police their own borders. 
The Kremlin trusted the West in 1989. 
Subsequent Russian leaders refuse to be duped again. Chinese leaders embraced 1989’s most puzzling legacy. 
They recoiled at the Soviet bloc’s disintegration. 
“Every effort should be made to prevent changes in Eastern Europe from influencing China’s internal development,” party officials concluded in March 1989, and within months they violently crushed democratic protesters. 
China took from 1989 the lesson that state stability was paramount. 
Yet China’s leaders also recognized that they ignored popular demands at great peril. 
The government thus made an implicit deal with its citizens: political dissent would not be tolerated, but, in exchange, the state would guarantee economic growth. 
No one could question the government’s legitimacy so long as prosperity expanded. 
Chinese foreign policy also prioritized legitimacy after 1989, with the regime hoping to reassert its authority globally by expanding China’s participation in international organizations. 
Chinese leaders embraced the cooperative nature of the post-1945 European process, but simultaneously took the Russian lesson to heart: the West would not yield merely to good intentions. 
But, unlike Russia, China de-emphasized the relevance of traditional hard power to achieve its goals. 
In fact, Chinese leaders have spent remarkably little, relative to China’s growing GDP, on the military. 
Chinese power today comes not from its ability to match America’s blue-water navy, but from its holdings in US Treasury bonds. 
The legacy of 1989 echoes even in Iran, whose leaders seem clearly to have learned from Tiananmen Square and the collapse of the Iron Curtain that a committed government can, indeed, demobilize a public demanding reform. 
The world would not soon forget the horrors of Tiananmen, global protestors promised in 1989. 
The Virtual Enemy 
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September, 2001, yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells operate, and what their weaknesses are. 
The Bush administration still uses the phrase “war on terror” and behaves as though it really is a war, the ordinary kind where one government fights another. 
Yet after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse. 
It is time to understand the new, emerging model of conflict. 
In order to make the “war” paradigm fit, the Bush administration alludes to al-Qaeda as a centrally directed enemy. 
In fact, there is now no master planner or funder of terrorist activities. 
The Madrid, London, and Bali attacks, as well as several thwarted operations in the United States and Britain, were all characterized by their dispersed organization. 
Independently generated plots emerged and used ad hoc resources, often within the target country. 
Those small operations also lacked a common internal design. 
Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person. 
Individuals can be involved for profit and power, or for political and religious reasons, while others participate for hate or thrills. 
Moreover, there are vast differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain, or jumps from cell to cell. 
Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head. 
The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context. 
Terrorism is a violent version of an “agile virtual enterprise.” A virtual enterprise is any small group that self-assembles into an organization that is just large enough to accomplish the collective intention. 
Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative, and, in the business sector, they are possibly the only system that can build a one-off product well. 
A conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry. 
In fact, they are probably the commercial model of the future. 
The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability. 
At present, most of the price of any product supports the huge, inefficient organization that assembled it. 
Nearly all the creativity and problem solving occurs in small companies and is later “integrated” by mega-corporations, which have an expensive and vulnerable infrastructure, and keep most of the profit. 
This model is the current basis of the business world, just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy. 
When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself. 
The small suppliers actually provide you with 80% of the value and innovation but only receive 20% of the reward. 
Ironically, extensive research into alternative models was funded through the US Department of Defense, which, as the world’s largest buyer of complex machinery, wanted better, cheaper and more tailored goods. 
The research noted the conditions and triggers needed to facilitate the self-assembly of small opportunistic groups and enable them to act like large companies. 
Unfortunately, the research program was cancelled before its findings could be applied in the business world, almost certainly because it threatened large companies. 
It is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of these same insights. 
But the planning for the Iraq invasion, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than advised, suggests a poor understanding of distributed systems. 
While the forces were deployed for a flexible entry and withdrawal, the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-fashioned occupation. 
Terrorists have been better at capitalizing on models of distributed operation. 
Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies. 
The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public. 
These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques. 
Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management: how to nurture and support self-organizing cells. 
Perhaps the first lesson for Western policymakers is that virtual enterprises run on a culture of trust. 
Some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of “not us” rather than on real values and direct experience. 
That is why the Bush administration’s actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic. 
Bush’s “us and them” rhetoric clearly defines an “other” and positions it as a cohesive enemy. 
His “war” approach is making it easier for Islamist terrorists to view the West as an equally united and malevolent force. 
In the future, the virtual enterprise model will shape how business is conducted, wars will be fought and probably how government services will be administered. 
It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, implying faster innovation and economic growth. 
However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate, they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise. 
The Virtual Imagination 
MILAN – Will books, through the power of computers and the internet, be transformed into boundless “hypertextual structures” in which the reader is also author? 
Today, two sorts of books exist: those to be read and those to be consulted. 
With books-to-be-read, you start at page 1, say, where the author tells you a crime has been committed. 
You follow until the end, when you discover who is guilty. 
End of book; end of reading experience. 
The same happens even if you read philosophy, say, Husserl. 
The author opens at the fist page, and follows a series of questions in order for you to see how he reaches his conclusions. 
Encyclopedias, of course, are never meant to be read cover to cover. 
If I want to know whether it was possible that Napoleon met Kant, I pick up volumes K and N and discover that Napoleon was born in 1769 and died in 1821, and that Kant was born in 1724 and died in 1804. 
It is possible that the two met. 
To know precisely, I consult a biography of Kant. 
A biography of Napoleon, who met many people, might disregard a meeting with Kant; a biography of Kant would not. 
Computers are beginning to change the reading process. 
With a hypertext, for example, I can ask for all the cases in which the name of Napoleon is linked with Kant. 
I can do my job in a few seconds. 
Hypertexts will render obsolete printed encyclopedia. 
But although computers are diffusing a new form of literacy, they are incapable of satisfying all the intellectual needs they stimulate. 
Two inventions on the verge of being exploited may help computers begin to satisfy these needs. 
The first is a copying machine through which you scan library catalogues and the books of publishing houses. 
You select the book you need, push a button, and the machine will print and bind your copy. 
This will change all publishing; it will probably eliminate bookstores but not books. 
Books will be tailored to the desires of the buyer, as happened with old manuscripts. 
The second invention is the e-book: by inserting a micro cassette into the spine or by connecting it with the Internet, you will have your book. 
But this book is as different as the first Shakespeare folio of 1623 is from the latest Penguin edition. 
Some people who say that they never read printed books are now reading, say, Kafka, in an e-book. 
On paper or on the electronic page, Kafka is the same for readers, if not from the point of view of eye doctors. 
Books will survive because of their utilitarian value, but the creative process in which they arise may not. 
To understand why, we must draw a distinction between systems and text. 
A system is all the possibilities displayed by a given natural language. 
A finite set of grammatical rules allows you to produce an infinite number of sentences and every linguistic item can be interpreted in terms of other linguistic items, a word by a definition, an event by an example, and so on. 
A text, however, reduces the infinite possibilities of a system to form a closed universe. 
Take the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. 
The text starts from a given set of characters and situations (a little girl, a mother, a grandmother, a wolf, a wood) and through a series of steps arrives at a solution. 
You can read the fairy tale as an allegory and attribute different morals to the events and characters, but you cannot transform Little Red Riding Hood into Cinderella. 
But many internet programs suggest that a story is enriched by successive contributions. 
Take Little Red Riding Hood again. 
The first author proposes a starting situation (the girl enters the wood) and different contributors develop the story - the girl does not meet a wolf but, instead, meets Pinocchio. 
Both enter an enchanted castle. They may confront a magic crocodile. 
And so on. The notion of authorship is thrown in doubt. 
This has sometimes happened in the past without disturbing authorship. 
With the Commedia dell’arte, every performance was different. We cannot identify a single work due to a single author. 
Another example is a jazz jam session. 
We may believe there is a privileged performance of “Basin Street Blues” because a recording survives. 
But there were as many Basin Street Blues as there were performances. 
But there is a difference between infinite, unlimited texts and texts which can be interpreted in infinite ways but are physically limited. 
Take Tolstoy’s War and Peace: you wish Natasha to spurn Kuryagin; you desire that Prince Andrzej live so that Natasha and he can be together. 
Make “War and Peace” into a hypertext and you can rewrite the story: Pierre kills Napoleon or Napoleon defeats General Kutusov. 
What freedom! 
Everyone is Tolstoy! 
In Les Miserables Victor Hugo provides us with a beautiful description of Waterloo. 
Hugo not only knows what happened but also what could have happened and didn’t. 
With a hypertextual program you could rewrite Waterloo so that Napoleon wins, but the tragic beauty of Hugo’s Waterloo is that things happen independent of the reader’s wishes. 
The charm of tragic literature is that we feel that its heroes could have escaped their Fate but do not because of weakness, or pride or blindness. 
Besides, Hugo tells us “Such a fall which astonished the whole of History, is it something without a cause? 
No...Someone, to whom none can object, took care of that event, God passed over there.” That is what every great book tells us, that God passed over. 
There are books that we cannot rewrite because their function is to teach us about Necessity, and only if they are respected as they are can they provide us with such wisdom. 
Their repressive lesson is indispensable to reach a higher state of intellectual and moral freedom. 
The Wages of Economic Ignorance 
LONDON – Politicians are masters at “passing the buck.” 
Everything good that happens reflects their exceptional talents and efforts; everything bad is caused by someone or something else. 
The economy is a classic field for this strategy. 
Three years after the global economy’s near-collapse, the feeble recovery has already petered out in most developed countries, whose economic inertia will drag down the rest. 
Pundits decry a “double-dip” recession, but in some countries the first dip never ended: Greek GDP has been dipping for three years. 
When we ask politicians to explain these deplorable results, they reply in unison: “It’s not our fault.” 
But this is to turn the matter on its head. 
The eurozone crisis did not derail recovery; it is the result of a lack of recovery. 
It is the natural, predictable, and (by many) predicted result of the main European countries’ deliberate policy of repressing aggregate demand. 
That policy was destined to produce a financial crisis, because it was bound to leave governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts. 
Despite austerity, the forecast of this year’s UK structural deficit has increased from 6.5% to 8% – requiring an extra £22 billion ($34.6 billion) in cuts a year. 
Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne blame the eurozone crisis; in fact, their own economic illiteracy is to blame. 
Unfortunately for all of us, the explanation bears repeating nowadays. Depressions, recessions, contractions – call them what you will – occur because the private-sector spends less than it did previously. 
This means that its income falls, because spending by one firm or household is income for another. 
In this situation, government deficits rise naturally, as tax revenues decline and spending on unemployment insurance and other benefits rises. 
These “automatic stabilizers” plug part of the private-sector spending gap. 
But if the government starts reducing its own deficit before private-sector spending recovers, the net result will be a further decline in total spending, and hence in total income, causing the government’s deficit to widen, rather than narrow. 
True, if governments stop spending altogether, deficits will eventually fall to zero. 
People will starve to death in the interim, but the budget will be balanced. 
That is the crazy logic of current economic policy in much of Europe (and elsewhere). 
Of course, it will not be carried through to the bitter end. 
Too much will crack along the way – the banks, the monetary system, social cohesion, the legitimacy of the political regime. 
Our leaders may be intellectually challenged, but they are not suicidal. 
Deficit reduction eventually will be put into cold storage, either openly, as I would prefer, or surreptitiously, as is politicians’ way. 
In the United Kingdom, there is already talk of Plan A +. 
Those who see the need for such a growth strategy, but who also want to help their friends, like the idea of tax cuts – especially for the rich. 
This knocks a hole in current deficit-reduction plans, but, provided government continues to cut spending, it has the benefit (from a conservative’s point of view) of shrinking the state’s role over time. 
Apart from questions of fairness, cutting top tax rates is an inferior way to increase spending, because the rich have a higher propensity to save. 
Tax reductions should be targeted specifically at the poor if one wants the money to be spent to stimulate the economy. 
In fact, the best option of all is for the government to spend the money itself. 
Governments can do this consistently with a medium-term deficit-reduction plan by making a crucial distinction between their budgets’ current and capital accounts. 
The current account covers spending on services and perishable goods that produce no assets. 
The capital account is for buying or building durable assets that give a prospective future return. 
The first is a charge on taxation; the second is not. 
If today’s accounting rules are too insensitive to make this distinction, a separate entity could do the investing. 
A national investment bank would be capitalized by the government, borrow from the private sector, and invest in infrastructure, housing, and “greening” the economy. 
This would simultaneously plug a hole in demand and improve the economy’s long-term growth prospects. 
There are signs that officials in the UK and the United States are starting to move in this direction. 
If nothing works, it will be time to sprinkle the country with what Milton Friedman called “helicopter money” – that is, put purchasing power directly into people’s pockets, by giving every household a spending voucher with an expiration date. 
This would at least keep the economy afloat pending the development of the longer-term investment program. 
It would be better if such schemes could be agreed upon by all by G-20 countries, as was briefly the case in the coordinated stimulus of April 2009. 
If not, groups of countries should pursue them on their own. 
The European Union desperately needs a growth strategy. 
Its current bailout schemes only help countries like Greece and Italy to borrow money cheaply in the face of prohibitively high market interest rates, while the schemes’ insistence on more budget-deficit reduction in these countries will reduce European purchasing power further. 
The recipient governments will have to cut their spending; the banks will have to take large losses. 
In the long run, the eurozone must be recognized as a failed experiment. 
It should be reconstituted with far fewer members, including only countries that do not run persistent current-account deficits. 
Everything else that has been proposed to save the eurozone in its current form – a central treasury, a monetary authority that does more than target inflation, fiscal harmonization, a new treaty – is a political pipe dream. 
The Wall Blocking the Roadmap 
The roadmap to peace between Israelis and Palestinians faces countless bloody detours. 
Few Israelis expect Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas to deliver security to Israel, or to implement far reaching political and financial reforms. 
Few Palestinians expect Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to deliver what they want: a freeze on the construction and expansion of settlements, and the eventual creation of a truly sovereign Palestinian state on contiguous territory. 
In a survey of Israeli and Palestinian opinion of the roadmap, Yaakov Shamir of Hebrew University and I found that only 15% of Palestinians agreed that Sharon would stand by Israel's commitments, while only 30% of Israelis believed that Abu Mazen would hold up the Palestinian end of the agreement. 
Security remains the critical component in the first phase of the roadmap for both parties. 
The roadmap calls upon the Palestinians to take steps that would bring violence to an end. 
One early Palestinian achievement has been a ceasefire agreement among all factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad (although both groups claim the right to retaliate for Israel's ``targeted killings'' of their leaders). 
But the roadmap stipulates that additional measures are to be taken by Palestinian authorities, including arresting individuals planning or carrying out violent attacks and the ``dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure,'' including confiscating illegal weapons from armed groups. 
The Palestinian security services are discovering that they lack the capacity to do so without risking civil war. 
But even if they could disarm the extremists, Palestinians are divided about how far they are willing to go to attain security for Israel. 
While the ceasefire remains popular--albeit increasingly tenuous in light of recent events--few Palestinians wish to see the Palestinian Authority permanently break the back of the armed resistance forces. 
Many Palestinians view violence as a useful tool in the struggle for independence and do not want to destroy the capability to resort to arms in the future if Israel reneges on its roadmap commitment to end the occupation. 
Palestinian opinion offers a different option for restraining Hamas and dismantling the ``infrastructure of violence'': incorporating Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and other factions, into the political process. 
For the younger generation of Palestinian political activists, the best hope for independence lies in the emergence of an empowered young guard, incorporating both nationalists and Islamists. 
These younger leaders guided the Intifada, gaining stature within Palestinian society, as well as a feeling that they might soon supplant the traditional old guard of the PLO. 
Youthful nationalists believe that they will gain outright leadership among Palestinians when they convince moderate young Islamists to abandon Hamas and Islamic Jihad to join with them in ousting the old guard. 
But Israelis do not accept this political logic. 
For them, such developments look like a trap that would consolidate the ``infrastructure of terror.'' 
This is where Israel's wall of separation comes in. 
They do not want to deal with the Palestinians, and so are erecting a physical barrier through areas that are now nominally under Palestinian control. 
While the roadmap speaks volumes about security, it makes no mention whatsoever of the Israeli wall. 
Yet the wall and the second phase of the roadmap, which calls for a Palestinian state with provisional borders, cannot co-exist. 
Work on the wall started around a year ago. 
Initially aimed at creating a security fence along the green line, the 1967 borders of Israel, it has gradually stretched across that would-be boundary, confiscating Palestinian land and amounting to a de facto annexation of a large part of the West Bank. 
For example, the planned portion of the wall that reaches the settlement of Ariel, deep inside the West Bank, extends 15 kilometers inside Palestinian territories. 
By encircling large parts of the West Bank from the east, covering as much as 50% of Palestinian territory, the wall deprives Palestinians of access to Jordan, their eastern neighbor. 
In Palestinian eyes, the wall is a unilateral measure that creates facts on the ground and short-circuits the timing and effectiveness of so-called ``permanent status'' negotiations, which are envisaged in the third phase of the roadmap. 
This is because the second phase, which still has to be achieved, calls for a Palestinian state with contiguous but provisional borders. 
The projected path of the wall eliminates Palestinian contiguity altogether. 
So continuing its construction will kill any Palestinian enthusiasm for the second phase of the roadmap. 
Instead, Israelis will have a strong incentive to demand an immediate implementation of the third phase, in other words, to go directly to ``permanent status'' talks. 
Permanent status negotiations, dealing with all the major issues of the conflict--including refugees, Jerusalem, settlement, security, water, and, of course, the permanent borders of the Palestinian state--are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2005, while Ariel Sharon is still slated to be Prime Minister. 
Immediate resumption of these talks will lead to profound Palestinian despair, much deeper than the disillusion that followed the collapse of the Camp David summit in July 2000. 
The roadmap, with its promise of fast achievements in the form of an Israeli settlement freeze and early Palestinian statehood, provides incentives for the Palestinian Authority to deliver security for Israelis on a sustained basis. 
If Israel must have its wall, it must also restrict it to the 1967 Green Line. 
If not, no wall will be able to contain Palestinian rage. 
The Walls of August 
MOSCOW – History’s milestones are rarely so neatly arrayed as they are this summer. 
Fifty years ago this month, the Berlin Wall was born. 
After some hesitation, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Union’s leader, allowed his East German counterpart, Walter Ulbricht, to erect a barrier between East and West Berlin in order to ensure the survival of communism in the entire Soviet bloc. 
By that point, East Germany had hemorrhaged three million people – including many of its most talented – as hundreds each day peacefully walked into the zones of Berlin that were controlled by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. 
And 20 years ago this month, hardliners in the Soviet government attempted to overthrow President Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two years after US President Ronald Reagan memorably called on him to “tear down this wall,” had done just that. 
Somewhat miraculously, a reformer who wanted Russians to be part of the democratic West had come to power in the Kremlin. 
Gorbachev’s hard-line Politburo adversaries, like those who had hemmed in Khrushchev at the time of the Berlin Wall’s construction, were determined to preserve the decrepit system that the Wall symbolized. 
But, in August 1991, ordinary Muscovites stood their ground. 
They defied the coup makers, and in the end carried with them much of the Russian Army. 
With their defiance, the coup was doomed. 
Berliners never stood a similar chance in the face of Soviet power. 
Khrushchev had assented to Ulbricht’s plea that only a physical barrier would maintain the viability of the East German state. 
Khrushchev’s response was reminiscent of how he dealt with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a time when he was just consolidating his rule and needed to keep Kremlin hardliners at bay. 
But five years after the brutal suppression of the demands for freedom heard in Budapest, Khrushchev was not fully convinced of the need to divide Berlin. 
He feared that his policy of improved relations with Western Europe would be destroyed in the process, and that President John F. Kennedy would view the Wall as the first provocative step in a confrontation that could lead to nuclear war. 
Khrushchev had placed enormous hope in the Soviet Union’s ability to build more positive relations with Europe, particularly after the U-2 spy plane incident in 1960 (when the American pilot Gary Francis Powers was shot down over Soviet territory) had poisoned relations with the US. 
While his summit with Kennedy in Vienna earlier in 1961 had done nothing to improve the situation, erecting the Wall on August 13 seemed to him a purely defensive act, not a show of force. 
Khrushchev was considering his own political fortunes as well. 
Ever since his 1956 Secret Speech denouncing Stalin’s cult of personality, his position within the Politburo had weakened; his support among the Kremlin leadership was shallow, and hardliners sniped at him from every direction. 
In the end, the decision to build the Wall was a desperate bid both to secure the continuation of communist rule in East Germany and to appease his detractors. 
Brinkmanship of the sort that took place as the Wall went up is usually the product of a politician desperate to shore up his domestic position. 
The irony for Khrushchev was that, though the hardliners wanted the Wall, they later included his indecisiveness about the Wall on the charge sheet used to force his removal in 1964. 
His decision preserved Soviet rule in East Germany for decades, but contributed to his own political demise. 
When Gorbachev allowed the Wall to be breached and then demolished, he alienated the bulk of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union even more than Khrushchev had. 
Indeed, Gorbachev once told me how Nicolae Ceauşescu, Romania’s dictator, called him to request that tanks be sent into Berlin to preserve the Wall. 
But Gorbachev, though still a believer in communism, refused to maintain the Soviet empire at the barrel of a gun. 
His was a brinkmanship very different from Khrushchev’s: he was daring the West to recognize and accept that the USSR had truly changed. 
In a conversation with then US Secretary of State James Baker, Gorbachev took issue with the American side constantly referring to the “Western values of freedom,” insisting that “these are human values.” 
By the time the West came to believe that Gorbachev and his reforms were genuine, resentment among his Kremlin colleagues was boiling over. 
The coup leaders of August 1991 viewed Gorbachev’s ouster the same way Ulbricht had regarded his demand for the Wall – as the only means to preserve communist rule. 
When the West tried to warn Gorbachev that a coup was coming, it was already too late. 
But ordinary Russians’ sudden, unexpected defense of their newfound freedoms, together with the putschists’ sheer incompetence, defeated the effort to restore totalitarian rule. 
Had the Wall not been built in 1961, would communism have collapsed sooner? 
Had Gorbachev responded to Ceauşescu’s plea and sent troops to defend the Wall, would communism in Europe ever have collapsed? 
These are unanswerable questions. 
And, given that Gorbachev refused to use force anywhere to preserve the Soviet’s East European empire, the idea that he would do so to preserve the Wall seems preposterous. 
What does seem clear is that, in the end, no wall can hold back democracy – and, conversely, that if a country’s people don’t want democracy enough, no Berlin Wall is needed to keep it out. 
The world has Vladimir Putin to thank for that lesson. 
The War Against Iraq’s Children 
Iraq’s children have suffered more than just successive wars and economic sanctions. 
The loss of parents and family resources has boosted child labor, homelessness, and inclinations towards violence and rebellion. 
They often now live in homes where 25 people live in a space of 40 square meters. 
Even intact families may comprise parents and five children in a single six-meter room. 
The increase in child labor reflects families’ dire economic situation: children are frequently a family’s only breadwinners, and they work cheap. 
Contractors in municipal services, for example, prefer to use children in order to cut costs. 
Here, a child may be used for agricultural labor or for janitorial work. 
Many work in piles of garbage, either removing them to another place or collecting empty bottles and cans to sell. 
Other children load and transport items in the markets, where they must pull carts weighing 60-70 kilograms and carry boxes weighing 15 kilograms in temperatures of 50 degrees centigrade. 
Two children may unload a truck carrying 1,000 kilograms of food items. 
Not surprisingly, Iraq’s child workers suffer from a wide array of serious health problems. 
Children who work in the garbage dumps are prone to skin and respiratory problems, while those who work with paints eventually become addicted to the intoxicants that they inhale. 
And all working children are vulnerable to malnutrition, as their diet typically lacks the items necessary to build body tissues. 
Nor is there any official authority to protect children and defend their rights in case of incapacitation or sickness. 
On the contrary, children are often beaten by family members if they do not provide the daily wage expected of them, or by their bosses when they are inattentive or make a mistake. 
Indeed, Iraqi children are exposed to beating without regard for their age and for myriad reasons, thus growing up insecure, hostile, and violent. 
Moreover, they are prone to being kidnapped by criminal gangs, trained to steal or pickpocket, or, worse, placed at the mercy of terrorists for use in attacks. 
The deterioration of families’ financial situation has also left poor children deprived of educational opportunity. 
For many children, even when they do attend school, the collapse of infrastructure, the unavailability of electricity and water, and high temperatures in the summer are hardly conducive to successful study. 
The small number of schools, the poor condition of buildings, and the collapse of relationships between students and teachers is also at fault. 
Older children sit in classrooms with much younger children, growing frustrated and violent, rather than becoming role models for others to emulate. 
Iraqi girls suffer no less than boys – and often more. 
At one end of the spectrum of deprivation, their opportunities are more constrained. 
When a family’s income is insufficient to pay school fees for every child, girls are typically denied an education, owing to the traditional belief that marriage is a girl’s final destiny. 
They must perform household chores and are subject to beating if they do not carry out orders issued by male family members. 
In poor households, they are also likely to receive less food than boys, placing their physical health and development at even greater risk. 
At the other end of the spectrum, rape, adultery, early child bearing, and abortion have become ordinary matters. 
Increasingly, Iraqi girls interpret anything given to them as a means to have sex with them. 
Orphans, whose number has increased sharply over the past quarter-century as a result of wars, economic sanctions, and terrorism, are especially vulnerable to the cruelest type of physical and psychological violence. 
Having lost their homes and parents, they sleep in alleys, sell cigarettes or newspapers, and beg. 
Grandparents are often unable or unwilling to care for them, and the pathological education given to them by criminal gangs often puts them beyond the reach of any institution’s ability to rehabilitate them. 
Simply put, children in Iraq have been reduced from human beings worthy of care to tools of production and instruments of violence. 
We are quite literally breeding a new generation of disorder. 
The War Against Iraqi Women 
BAGHDAD – Iraqi women’s organizations and international observers point to an escalating war against women in Iraq, aided by the widespread chaos and lawlessness under the US occupation. 
In addition to violence by US troops inside and outside of prisons, women in Iraq face daily violence from militants under the guise of religion and “liberation.” 
In Iraq’s second largest city, Basra, a stronghold of conservative Shia groups, as many as 133 women were killed last year for violating “Islamic teachings” and in so-called “honor killings,” according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 
The methods are brutal evidence of a backlash by previously subdued tribal forces that have been unleashed by the occupation: women strangled and beheaded, and their hands, arms and legs chopped off. 
With US forces in Iraq now funding both Sunni and Shia tribal leaders in an effort to stabilize the country, conditions for women grow deadlier by the day. 
Islamist leaders have imposed new restrictions on women, including prohibitions on work, bans on travel without a muhram (male guardian), and compulsory veiling. 
According to the Organization of Women’s Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), formed in Baghdad in 2003, women are harassed if they appear in the streets of most Iraqi cities and towns, educational institutions, or work places. 
Now there are even “no woman zones” in some southern cities controlled by Islamist parties and tribal leaders. 
Honor killings of Iraqi women are justified by alleged promiscuity or adultery. 
In fact, the practice targets holders of PhD’s, professionals, political activists, and office workers. “Politically active women, those who did not follow a strict dress code, and women human rights defenders were increasingly at risk of abuse, including by armed groups and religious extremists,” Amnesty International said in its 2007 report. 
Indeed, a top police official in Basra reported that as many as 15 women are killed every month in the city. 
Ambulance drivers in Basra, paid to “clean the streets” before people go to work, pick up many more bodies of women every morning. 
Ironically, the forces leading this assault on women had little or no power under Saddam Hussein. 
But, following the US-led invasion in 2003, southern Iraq was opened to forces known as Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (PVPV) – militant gangs and individuals committed to archaic Islamic rule and suppression of women’s rights. 
Some members of these groups now serve in government, others in militias or as self-appointed vigilantes or hired guns. 
The goal of the PVPV is to confine women to the domestic realm and end all female participation in public and political life. 
To date, Iraqi officials have not been willing to deal with this escalating violence against women, or even to discuss it. 
But, as elected representatives, they are obligated to address these crimes. 
So must the US. 
Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, the responsibility for protecting civilian populations in an occupied country belongs to the occupying forces, which, in this case, are clearly failing to protect Iraqi women. 
Two measures are urgently needed. 
First, the Iraqi government must immediately establish “Protection of Women” security patrols in Iraq’s southern cities. 
These patrols must receive gender-sensitive training and prioritize women’s security over tribal or fundamentalist religious values. 
Second, pursuant to its obligations under the Geneva Convention, the US must immediately take steps to protect the lives and freedoms of Iraqi civilians. 
Unless the US does so, it must withdraw from Iraq, because the occupation would merely continue to sustain a breeding ground for violence against women. 
The timetable for action is not subject to debate. 
The War for Oil 
For decades, through Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, America has pursued a set of straightforward energy policy objectives: keep world oil prices as stable as possible; reduce domestic consumption of oil as painlessly as possible; reduce dependence on foreign imports whenever possible; and diversify the sources of imported oil. 
Despite appearances, none of these objectives has changed under the Bush administration. 
Many observers believe that Bush has set a new course because the invasion of Iraq seems to fly in the face of these objectives. 
A big increase in Iraq's oil production would probably increase US dependence on oil relative to other energy sources, as world oil prices will probably fall in response to the additional supplies. 
This, in turn, would mean an increase in US dependence on imported oil, especially from the Middle East. 
The irony, however, is that the US exercised greater control over the Iraqi oil sector under the UN's pre-war "Oil-for-Food Program" (in which the UN, not Saddam Hussein, determined the level of Iraqi oil sales abroad) than it will in any future democratic Iraq. 
If the Bush administration was seeking stable, secure, diverse and cheap oil supplies, it could have simply lifted the embargos on Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan and let the oil gush. 
But America's interest in Iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or energy policy. 
The Bush administration recognized that, above all, Iraqi oil is a critical geopolitical asset. 
Whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq. 
Saddam's power came from his control of the world's second largest oil reserve. 
He understood perfectly the role that oil played in his power. 
Faced with the possibility of invasion and defeat, Saddam threatened to burn Iraq's oil fields. 
Much of the subsequent destruction and looting of Iraqi oil facilities and pipelines reflects the widespread realization that control of oil means control of Iraq. 
As the US planned its invasion, securing the oil fields became a critical priority. 
The goal was not increased supplies or reduced prices for Americans, but stripping Saddam of his power and, ultimately, establishing and solidifying a new Iraqi government. 
Iraq's future depends directly on the fate of Iraqi oil production. 
Yet the vagaries of the oil business, particularly in such unsettled conditions, make it hard to see how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its goals in Iraq within the next few years. 
The logic is simple. 
The US must use oil revenues to lift the burden of financing regime change in Iraq from American taxpayers. 
All reconstruction plans depend in the long run on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities. 
If Iraq does not deliver its oil, President Bush cannot deliver on his promises to the Iraqi people, the American people, or the world community. 
Before the invasion, Iraq's oil production capacity reached three million barrels per day. 
Iraq will not be able to increase its production to that level within the time frame needed to establish an Iraqi government. 
Any increase in Iraqi oil production requires developing the oil fields, which means big investments, a legal and representative government, and political stability. 
Not even the Bush administration expects these requirements to be met soon. 
Indeed, political stability is the main condition for increasing production capacity. 
Historical evidence from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq itself, indicates that it takes about three years from the re-establishment of political stability for capacity to increase significantly and for those new higher levels to be sustained. 
Iraq needs several years to write a new constitution, establish a legitimate and democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues among its various regions, enact new investment laws, and make the economy attractive to foreigners. 
It also needs time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighboring countries, to perform technical and feasibility studies, and to reconstruct, rehabilitate, and explore its oil fields. 
So even a three-year time frame seems optimistic, for it assumes that within that period, the occupation will end, Iraqis will establish their own democratic government, and that political stability will be achieved. 
Needless to say, the situation may play out differently. 
Tensions may remain high for years. 
No one should be surprised, moreover, if Iraqi oil production suddenly stops altogether even under a democratic government. 
History suggests that labor strikes and similar disruptions that can halt oil production are a greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries. 
If Iraq cannot quickly increase its production capacity in the next few years, this will hinder both US foreign and energy policies. 
How will the US finance the long-term reconstruction of Iraq? 
Who will pay to maintain a fragile Iraqi democracy? 
Can the US sustain its occupation if it cannot provide food, health care, and other basic services to Iraq's people? 
These are tough questions, and they are fundamentally unanswerable until a stable, democratic regime in Iraq can control and ensure a steady flow of oil exports.
