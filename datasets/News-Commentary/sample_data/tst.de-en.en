A firm rejection of the one-party state will also reverberate far beyond Japan’s borders. 
It shows clearly that the desire for political choice is not confined to a few fortunate countries, mostly in the Western world. 
The Re-Birth of Utopia 
This cleavage now seems set to shape not only Germany’s future coalition government, but the future of politics across Europe. 
This fundamental debate is not about to abate. 
On the contrary, as the German election shows and with a presidential election looming in France, the debate has intensified. 
In France, this intensity is particularly visible within Socialist ranks. 
With preparations for the party’s November congress in full swing, a conflict that goes back to the party’s founding is reappearing. 
With the disappearance of the communist world and the failure of its collectivist policies, one would think that this debate had been resolved in favor of the reformist vision. 
But the surprise of the last few months is that an important part of the Socialist electorate and party leaders back radical change. 
The media success of Olivier Besancenot, a 31-year-old representative of the most intransigent section of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist League, reflects the power of this dream. 
Interestingly, an echo of the ideas mooted by radical anti-globalists can be found in someinitiatives coming from the right. 
President Jacques Chirac of France, but also Brazil’s leftist president, Lula da Silva support a tax on airline tickets designed to finance poor countries’ development. 
How do we explain this resurgent radicalism, which seems to ignore European and international political realities? 
One might suspect the influence of French political traditions which, on the right as much as on the left, always prefer purity of principle to messy compromise. 
Similarly, the social mobility once fostered by the welfare state has suffered serious reverses. 
Globalized markets are viewed as bringingmore inequalities, austerity, and insecurity than the promised benefits of economic growth. 
In this disenchanted environment, dreams of utopia thrive. 
But it is a fundamental characteristic of utopias that they cannot be implemented. 
What is now needed is a more modest debate about how to reconcile the deficiencies of the market with the demands of solidarity. 
Should the state confine itself to creating an economic environment favorable to private enterprise? 
How extensively should it contribute to security, education, research, innovation, and protection of the poor? 
But such debates can be fruitful only if they recognize the economic and political constraints under which modern states operate. 
Indeed, the role of the state is made more complicated by the fact that market regulation is becoming less national and more transnational. 
The Re-Education of Hong Kong 
HONG KONG – After less than 100 days in office, C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong’s new Chief Executive, is already in political intensive care. 
In record time, he has managed to lose his veneer of competence, credibility, and steely leadership. 
One of his cabinet appointees was arrested for corruption within two weeks of Leung’s assumption of his official duties. 
The goal of the program, inherited from the previous administration, is a good one: expand knowledge among the young about modern China. 
But, as Tang correctly pointed out in response to a question about the protests, the “devil is in the details.” 
What triggered the uproar was the appearance of a “model” textbook, financed by the government and published by a pro-China think tank. 
It offers no discussion of the lethal policies since 1949 that led to the persecution and starvation of tens of millions of Chinese. 
Nor does it mention the fratricidal political movements from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution. 
The program was clearly meant to indoctrinate, not educate. 
Massive protests forced Leung to withdraw a deadline to implement the new curriculum. 
He has also given the schools flexibility concerning when and perhaps how to introduce it. 
Since nearly all schools are dependent on government subsidies, the grant of flexibility is widely perceived to be a tactical delay. 
With the job security of schoolmasters at risk, most are sure to implement the program. 
The protesters, led by a 15-year-old student, now a folk hero, have retreated, but that, too, is a tactical decision. 
The students have promised to continue to fight the program until it is scrapped. 
But why does China’s government seek to impose the curriculum in the first place? 
Nevertheless, after more than 60 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to retain a deep sense of insecurity. 
While dissent is the lifeblood of any open society, for China it is a dangerous poison. 
Few in Hong Kong are buying the political elite’s mantra that the national education program is the “right” thing to do. 
Leung’s son, for example, is reportedly a student at Winchester College, one of the UK’s most exclusive boarding schools. 
And most, if not all, of the children of the ruling elite in Beijing are in a similar position. 
The daughter of Xi Jinping, the presumptive future leader who has now reemerged from an unexplained absence, is attending Harvard under an assumed name. 
Their parents clearly know that “national education” is not needed for a good education. 
Unfortunately, Hong Kong’s younger generation is losing confidence in democracy. 
As a result, more and more young people are turning to street demonstrations to make their voices heard. 
And, while no one in Hong Kong wants independence from China, continued strong-arm tactics to force Hong Kong to “love” China could begin to inspire such sentiments. 
Leung’s tone-deafness to popular feeling revives one of the main issues that he managed to dodge during the election campaign. 
At the time, he denied vehemently that he was a member of the CCP. 
He claimed that he had only Hong Kong’s interest in mind within the limits of China’s “one country, two systems” formula. 
So far, however, he seems inclined to make one of those systems resemble the other. 
But China’s national interest is to ensure that Hong Kong remains a first-rate city, modern and open. 
Pulling Hong Kong down, in the name of patriotism, can only impede the advance to modernity that all of China needs to become truly great. 
The Real Abortion Tragedy 
But much less attention is given to the 86% of all abortions that occur in the developing world. 
In Africa, there are 29 abortions per 1,000 women, and 32 per 1,000 in Latin America. 
The comparable figure for Western Europe, where abortion is generally permitted in most circumstances, is 12. 
A further five million women are injured each year, sometimes permanently. 
That is a huge tragedy for individuals and for the future of our already very heavily populated planet. 
One would have thought that Roman Catholics would see these outcomes as desirable. 
Restricting access to legal abortion leads many poor women to seek abortion from unsafe providers. 
The legalization of abortion on request in South Africa in 1998 saw abortion-related deaths drop by 91%. 
And the development of the drugs misoprostol and mifepristone, which can be provided by pharmacists, makes relatively safe and inexpensive abortion possible in developing countries. 
Opponents will respond that abortion is, by its very nature, unsafe – for the fetus. 
They point out that abortion kills a unique, living human individual. 
That claim is difficult to deny, at least if by “human” we mean “member of the species Homo sapiens.” 
Membership of the species Homo sapiens is not enough to confer a right to life on a being. 
Yet “pro-life” groups that picket abortion clinics are rarely seen picketing slaughterhouses. 
We can plausibly argue that we ought not to kill, against their will, self-aware beings who want to continue to live. 
We can see this as a violation of their autonomy, or a thwarting of their preferences. 
We have no obligation to allow every being with the potential to become a rational being to realize that potential. 
The Real Blockade in Cuba 
Written some months before his arrests, this article details Rivero Castañeda's objections to the Castro regime. 
Such a man has lunch on his mind-his and his family's. 
In this country, the real blockade, the one that affects the daily life of the people, is the internal governing system. 
It is the noose that ensures that Cuba remains immobilized and poor. 
However, no political process has created a smooth path toward such an ending. 
Thus, the stalemate between the two nations really concerns only Cubans who have time to contemplate lofty political questions. 
Cuba provides no free flow of information and its citizens receive and read only pure propaganda. 
While the public is suspicious of government proclamations, it has no means to be heard. 
Hence, its silence appears to sanction the situation. 
Ordinary citizens want to own a modest business, have access to a free press, organize political parties, re-make society, and liberate prisoners. 
The nation is not a united citizenry, but rather a mediocre country created through the universal gagging of its people. 
One can systematically catalog the ways that the authorities mistreat many of its people as terribly as they claim that Cuba's enemies treat her. 
Indeed, parents cannot really influence how schools shape their children. 
The leaders' commitment to the sovereignty of the masses thus rings false. 
Talk about the Cubans' free will is in reality a capricious and criminal act against the people. 
In recent weeks, thirty-six human rights activists, members of the alternative press, and representatives of the emerging civil rights movement have been imprisoned and may be tried. 
Cubans are in the end consigned to hold fast to rigid and impossible schemes. 
As a result, hundreds of thousands of young adults are embarked on a future whose path is strewn with risky symbols and immense challenges. 
Sensing that the door has been slammed shut against their country's future, they work diligently merely for their individual good. 
The Real Che Guevara 
PARIS – Hollywood history is often nonsensical, but filmmakers usually have the good sense not to whitewash killers and sadists. 
Steven Soderbergh’s new film about Che Guevara, however, does that, and more. 
That hero of the left, with his hippie hair and beard, an image now iconic on t-shirts and coffee mugs around the world, is a myth concocted by Fidel Castro’s propagandists – something of a cross between Don Quixote and Robin Hood. 
Like those tall tales, Fidel’s myth of Che bears a superficial resemblance to historical facts, but the real story is far darker. 
Some Robin Hood probably did brutalize the rich and, to cover his tracks, gave some of his loot to the poor. 
In medieval Spain, Quixote-like knights probably did roam the countryside, ridding it not of dragons but of the land’s few remaining Muslims. 
The same goes for the legendary Che. 
No teenager in rebellion against the world or his parents seems able to resist Che’s alluring image. 
Just wearing a Che t-shirt is the shortest and cheapest way to appear to be on the right side of History. 
What works for teenagers also seems to work with forever-young movie directors. 
In the 1960’s, the Che look, with beard and beret, was at least a glib political statement. 
Today, it is little more than a fashion accoutrement that inspires a big-budget Hollywood epic. 
Are Che theme parks next? 
The true Che was a more significant figure than his fictional clone, for he was the incarnation of what revolution and Marxism really meant in the twentieth century. 
Che was no humanist. 
No communist leader, indeed, ever held humanist values. 
Karl Marx certainly was not one. 
True to their movement’s founding prophet, Stalin, Mao, Castro, and Che held no respect for life. 
When criticized by one of his early companions for the death of millions during the Chinese revolution, Mao observed that countless Chinese die everyday, so what did it matter? 
Likewise, Che could kill with a shrug. 
Trained as a medical doctor in Argentina, he chose not to save lives but to suppress them. 
After he seized power, Che put to death five hundred “enemies” of the revolution without trial, or even much discrimination. 
Castro, no humanist himself, did his best to neutralize Guevara by appointing him Minister for Industry. 
He did not care about Cuba’s economy or its people: his purpose was to pursue revolution for its own sake, whatever it meant, like art for art’s sake. 
Indeed, without his ideology, Che would have been nothing more than another serial killer. 
Ideological sloganeering allowed him to kill in larger numbers than any serial killer could imagine, and all in the name of justice. 
Five centuries ago, Che probably would have been one of those priest/soldiers exterminating Latin America’s natives in the name of God. 
In the name of History, Che, too, saw murder as a necessary tool of a noble cause. 
But suppose we judge this Marxist hero by his own criteria: did he actually transform the world? 
The answer is yes – but for the worse. 
Despite the social reforms the left likes to trumpet about Cuba, its literacy rate was higher before Castro came to power, and racism against the black population was less pervasive. 
Indeed, Cuba’s leaders today are far more likely to be white than they were in Batista’s day. 
Beyond Cuba, the Che myth has inspired thousands of students and activists across Latin America to lose their lives in foolhardy guerrilla struggles. 
The left, inspired by the siren call of Che, chose armed struggle instead of elections. 
By doing so, it opened the way to military dictatorship. 
Latin America is not yet cured of these unintended consequences of Guevarism. 
The real Che, who spent most of his time as Castro’s central banker supervising executions, deserves to be better known. 
Perhaps if Soderbergh’s two-part Che epic succeeds at the box office, his financial backers will want to film a more truthful sequel. 
The Real Danger of Global Warming 
I was invited to address this issue at a recent conference in Santa Barbara, California. 
My audience included business leaders who hope to profit from cap-and-trade policies and from subsidies for renewable energy and “green” jobs. 
My advice to them was to not get caught up in the hysteria. 
Europe is several years ahead of the US in implementing policies intended to mitigate global warming. 
These policies include a cap-and-trade initiative known as the Emissions Trading Scheme, steep fuel taxes, and ambitious programs to build windmills and other renewable energy projects. 
With the global financial crisis and the sudden economic downturn, two things are becoming clear. 
First, it will be difficult to afford these expensive new sources of energy. 
Second, energy rationing policies like cap-and-trade will be a permanent drag on economic activity. 
Ironically, emissions have not decreased as a result of these policies, but are doing so now as the world economy moves into recession. 
This is not a surprise to someone like me, having been actively involved in my country’s transition from communism to a free society and market economy. 
The result was a dramatic decline in CO2 emissions. 
The secret behind the cut in emissions was economic decline. 
It should be clear to everyone that there is a very strong correlation between economic growth and energy use. 
This is a fantasy. 
Cap-and-trade can only work by raising energy prices. 
Consumers who are forced to pay higher prices for energy will have less money to spend on other things. 
While the individual companies that provide the higher-priced “green” energy may do well, the net economic effect will be negative. 
It is necessary to look at the bigger picture. 
Profits can be made when energy is rationed or subsidized, but only within an economy operating at lower, or even negative, growth rates. 
This means that over the longer term, everyone will be competing for a piece of a pie that is smaller than it would have been without energy rationing. 
This does not auger well either for growth or for working our way out of today’s crisis. 
The Real Hazard of Globalization 
This argument - an example of what economists call ``moral hazard'' - is easy on the mind, but it has feet of clay. 
Moreover, foreign investment in emerging markets shifted after 1994 to factories, real estate, service industries, and so forth. 
The hazard struck after 1996, when foreign private investors fled emerging markets even faster than they had flooded them. 
For example, in 1997-98 Thailand suffered an outflow of foreign capital equivalent to 26% of GDP, despite a solid record of sustained economic growth. 
Why were even relatively well-run economies pulled under so suddenly? 
The most likely scenario is that investors attributed the steep initial rise in credit flows after 1989 to sound policies in emerging markets. 
Throughout much of the 1990s, the ``Washington establishment'' reinforced this belief, encouraging an overly optimistic belief in the permanence of large credit flows. 
Ultimately, however, each crisis multiplied the worries of investors about emerging-market risk. 
Worse still, their mood reversal was swift owing to the lack of a long and reliable track record for emerging-market debt. 
This drove up interest rates for emerging-market debt as an asset class . 
If this were the whole story, then what lay at the root of financial contagion in emerging markets would be of secondary importance. 
Whether moral hazard or globalization hazard, more careful credit rationing by investors could be expected to reduce the recurrence of financial crises. 
But only up to a point. 
For while the moral hazard argument emphasizes the orthodox commandment ``Thou shall not intervene,'' the crucial feature of globalization hazard is market failure . 
Unlike moral hazard, market failure highlights circumstances in which government intervention is both socially desirable and economically defensible. 
That the failure of international capital markets led to sudden and devastating capital outflows after 1996 is only one such episode. 
Consider other devastating events that are uninsured (and often uninsurable) in the private sector. 
In the US, for example, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes trigger immediate Federal assistance. 
Unfortunately, many emerging markets have weak governments that cannot define credible policies for financing intervention in such circumstances. 
A typical case is a country whose terms of trade abruptly deteriorate - for example, Nicaragua after the recent collapse of coffee prices caused by Vietnam's bumper crop. 
The government, faced with lower budget revenues, is likely to issue new debt, but without being able to specify how it will be repaid. 
So, who will pay the bill eventually? 
The moment official intervention is required, everyone runs for cover. 
Investment decisions are postponed, implying slower growth and an even more precarious fiscal position. 
Weak governments grow weaker by the day. 
But even weak governments are not entirely helpless. 
They can lengthen their debt maturities by imposing controls on capital inflows, as Chile and Colombia have done. 
They also can conclude trade agreements with more advanced economies. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, probably contributed to Mexico's strong and lasting recovery from the Tequila crisis. 
Such packages provide the breathing space that governments need in a crisis in order to launch longer-term reforms. 
This was true of Thailand and South Korea, when both moved fast to strengthen their banking sectors after receiving IMF bailouts. 
IMF assistance is, of course, no universal panacea. 
Emerging markets are inherently fragile markets. 
Precisely for this reason, the problem has been too little multilateral intervention, not too much. 
The Real Long March 
Every nation has its founding myth. 
For Communist China, it is the Long March – a story on a par with Moses leading the Israelites’ exodus out of Egypt. 
I was raised on it. 
The myth can be stated succinctly. 
The fledgling Communist Party and its three Red Armies were driven out of their bases in the South in the early 1930’s by Chiang Kaishek’s Nationalist government. 
Pursued and harried by their enemies, they crossed high mountains, turbulent rivers, and impassable grassland, with Mao steering the course from victory to victory. 
After two years and 10,000 miles of endurance, courage, and hope against impossible odds, the Red Armies reached northwest China. 
Only a fifth of the 200,000 soldiers remained, worn out, battered, but defiant. 
A decade later, they fought back, defeated Chiang Kaishek, and launched Mao’s New China. 
How does China’s founding myth stand up to reality? 
In 2004, seventy years after it began, I set out to retrace the Long March. 
It remains a daunting journey, through areas little changed to this day, inaccessible, and desperately poor. 
Of the 40,000 survivors, perhaps 500 are still alive; 
Huang Zhiji was a boy, little taller than his rifle, when he joined the Red Army. 
He had no choice: they had arrested his father and would not release him until Huang agreed. 
He thought of deserting, but stayed for fear of being caught and shot. 
Many did run away. 
Six weeks into the March, Mao’s First Army was reduced from 86,000 to 30,000 troops. 
The loss is still blamed on the Xiang River Battle, the Army’s first big engagement of the March. 
But at most 15,000 died in battle; the rest vanished. 
“When you investigate historical facts, you should respect the truth. How you present it is a different matter.” 
So the legend lives on. 
There was only a skirmish over the Dadu River. 
The local warlord, who hated Chiang Kaishek, let Mao pass. 
As a reward, he was later made a minister in the Communist government. 
The Marchers did not know where they would end up. 
There were constant debates about the final destination. 
When they converged in north China in October 1936, it was hailed as the end of the March. 
But the “promised land” was not as promised. 
It could barely support its own population, let alone the Red Armies. 
Soldiers had no clothes to protect them from freezing cold. 
Women were ordered to turn back and go home because there was not enough food. 
Barely a month after the union of the three Red Armies, the Party decided that the Long March was to continue. 
But the kidnapping of Chiang Kaishek by the general he had appointed to wipe out the Communists saved them. 
As part of the price for his release, Chiang recognized the Communists as legitimate. 
The Long March was over. 
Not, however, for the 21,000 men and women of the Western Legion. 
But Mao kept sending them contradictory orders; the result was that they could neither fight nor retreat. 
Trapped in barren land where survival was difficult, the overwhelming forces of Muslim warlords wiped them out. 
Only 400 reached the border; the rest were killed or captured. 
It was the Red Army’s biggest defeat. 
Yet it is missing from official history. 
Wang Quanyan, a senior officer, was taken by a Muslim commander as a concubine. 
She and the rest of the Fourth Army survivors had to fight for half a century to be recognized as Marchers. 
The Long Marchers persevered, fought, starved, despaired, and endured. 
Hunger drove the armies to take hostages for ransom. 
Purges continued until practically no officers were left to command battles. 
If the Marchers had doubts, they conquered them with the help of Communist propaganda. 
They rose to their ordealwith a bravery and self-sacrifice unsurpassed in China’s or anyone’s history. 
I asked a top general what he knew of communism at the time. “I had no idea then and now,” he replied. 
The Real Risks of Deficits 
Deficits are back--with a vengeance. 
America's government budget deficit now stands at $455 billion, 4.1% of GDP. 
Two years ago, the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. 
By running a deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations. 
Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations. 
Their priority is paying for immediate problems, and for today's promised benefits. 
The accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding something of the future cost. 
But what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not. 
Deficits raise not only immediate political issues, but also issues of distributive justice between generations, and of intergenerational risk sharing. 
No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation. 
Whether or not deficits treat future generations properly depends on how a government's systems for taxation and expenditure are designed. 
Those who advocate running deficits often portray them as necessary to fix an economy in which confidence is draining away. 
Following Keynes, they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression can take hold. 
It is like putting a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal. 
But such arguments, although valid at times, have their limits. 
Japan's public deficits spawned a national debt of 140% of annual GDP, without producing any economic resurgence. 
Indeed, today's budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what Keynesian theory envisions. 
So discussions about deficits should be recast in terms of the really long-term intergenerational issues that matter. 
The issues are subtle, because they hinge on what future governments may do. 
In the past, some governments, when faced with large national debts, effectively ``inflated them away.'' 
Governments could decide to act this way again, especially if national debts grow bigger. 
Continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed. 
Some future politicians may succeed again in planting the idea that inflation, being stimulative, is good for the economy. 
The scale of these obligations is monumental. 
The potential for budgetary shortfall with social security and health care is even worse in Europe and Japan, due to their more troublesome demographics. 
Moreover, unlike official national debt, social-welfare obligations are not fixed in currency. 
Instead, they are promises of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation. 
No government can thus ``inflate them away.'' 
But this does not mean that pensions and other welfare obligations are entirely fixed. 
What it does mean is that the problem is political. 
Pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy, and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue. 
Still, we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today's economic dilemmas. 
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a ``generational accounting'' that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations. 
Such adjustments will probably happen anyway in the coming decades, but only after a long lag and with many inequities in the process. 
What we need is the right system from the beginning, so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations. 
Can these issues be addressed now, when the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on short-term fixes? 
Hard times, like the Great Depression, have been occasions for fundamental changes. 
The Real Route to Democracy at the IMF 
Emerging market countries from Chile to China have been arguing for some time that the International Monetary Fund – the nerve center of the international financial system ­– needs to become more “democratic.” 
(Unfortunately, benign as current market conditions may seem, there will surely be a next time for some countries.) 
I couldn’t agree more. 
The IMF’s perceived “democratic deficit” is a serious challenge to the Fund’s political legitimacy and to its ability to effectively stabilize crisis situations. 
Right now is precisely the time to do so, given that the United States has become, without rival, the world’s most reckless borrower. 
The US is draining a whopping 75% of the world’s surplus savings. 
Today, even formerly bankrupt governments from Korea to Russia to Mexico are awash in dollars. 
Why not put some of those dollars to good use? 
At the end of the day, as long as the IMF is in the lending business, it needs to keep its creditors happy. 
Otherwise, they will pull up stakes, and the Fund (and its sister organization, the World Bank) will have a debt crisis of its own. 
Right now, the US, Europe, and Japan put up the lion’s share of the capital, so they have disproportionate power. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. 
Many middle-income countries’ central banks are hoarding dollars today in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating too much against the sinking dollar. 
China alone, with over $600 billion in reserves, holds more than enough dollars to recapitalize the IMF four times over. 
Even Latin American governments now hold enough dollar reserve assets to buy out Europe’s shares in the Fund. 
So, if the Fund is to resume its identity as a cooperative, it makes sense to shift its center of gravity. 
Would middle-income developing countries actually change things if they were big creditors at the Fund? 
I wonder. 
Admittedly, no developing country ever seems to vote against a big bailout for one of its brethren, no matter how ill conceived. 
I doubt it. 
On the whole, I expect that the bailout policies of a more “democratic” IMF would look much as they do now. 
After all, the laws of economics are always going to force prodigal debtor countries into adopting austerity measures. 
Perhaps the IMF’s bedside manners would improve, perhaps not. 
The big question is whether the rich countries that have long ruled the roost at the Fund would actually surrender some of their power. 
They really have little to lose and much to gain. 
So there is an upside to today’s massive US fiscal and current account deficits. 
Let’s do it now before the chance slips away when the next round of crises hits. 
Fulfilling the Genomic Promise 
VIENNA – For most people, a promise is a reason to expect something, a well-founded hope without hype. 
This promise originated almost 400 years ago, with the institutionalization of modern science. 
Spearheaded by this minority, the scientific revolution swept through Europe and, later, spread to the rest of the world. 
By imitating and twisting nature, he declared, its secrets would be revealed – and could be manipulated to improve humans’ lives. 
And yet society’s trust in science has not wavered. 
Today, genetics is the leading source of scientific promise. 
This movement – the latest incarnation of the endless quest for human advancement – poses new challenges to the relationship between science and society. 
As the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition: “The genomic revolution is here – are you ready?” 
For example, this revolution will undoubtedly lead to the engineering of life through synthetic biology, a prospect that remains controversial. 
As a result, it is now clear that people’s lifestyles do not concern only themselves. 
These developments – and the questions that they raise – underscore the need to redraw the map of the sciences. 
A more integrated research agenda that includes the social sciences is crucial to ensuring that the promise of genetic research benefits all. 
In fact, such research is integral to improving upon the factors that contribute most to a society’s wealth: health, education, and ethics. 
Indeed, more encompassing knowledge of personal genomics can engender a new sense of commonality. 
But realizing this vision requires accounting for the different choices that people make within a pluralistic society. 
Strengthening the real-world role of genetics is an essential step in that direction. 
The Reality of Virtual Power 
That is the argument of my new book, The Future of Power. 
Two types of power shifts are occurring in this century – power transition and power diffusion. 
The transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern, but power diffusion is a more novel process. 
The problem for all states today is that more is happening outside the control of even the most powerful of them. 
As for power transition, much attention nowadays is lavished on a supposed American decline, often with facile historical analogies to Britain and Rome. 
In an information-based world of cyber-insecurity, power diffusion may be a greater threat than power transition. 
What will it mean to wield power in the global information age of the twenty-first century? 
Which resources will produce power? 
Every age produces its own answers. 
Conventional wisdom has always held that the state with the largest military prevails. 
In an information age, however, it may be the state (or non-state) with the best story that wins. 
Today, it is far from clear how to measure a balance of power, much less how to develop successful survival strategies for this new world. 
Most current projections of a shift in the global balance of power are based primarily on one factor: projections of countries’ GDP growth. 
They thus ignore the other dimensions of power, including both hard military power and the soft power of narrative, not to mention the policy difficulties of combining them into successful strategies. 
A much larger part of their populations than ever before has access to the power that comes from information. 
Governments have always worried about the flow and control of information, and the current period is not the first to be strongly affected by dramatic changes in information technology. 
As the cost of computing and communication comes down, the barriers to entry decline. 
Individuals and private organizations, ranging from corporations to NGOs to terrorists, have thus been empowered to play a direct role in world politics. 
The spread of information means that power will be more widely distributed, and informal networks will undercut the monopoly of traditional bureaucracy. 
The speed of Internet time means that all governments will have less control over their agendas. 
Political leaders will enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events, and then will have to compete with an increasing number and variety of actors in order to be heard. 
The fall of the Tunisian regime had deep domestic roots, but the timing caught outsiders, including the US government, by surprise. 
Some observers attribute the acceleration of the revolution to Twitter and WikiLeaks. 
As the Obama administration formulates policy towards Egypt and Yemen, it faces a dilemma. 
In Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime has provided important assistance in dealing with the threat from Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorism. 
In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak’s rule helped to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and balanced Iranian power in the region. 
Simplistic endorsement of democracy by George W. Bush’s administration was costly both in Iraq and in Gaza, where elections gave rise to a hostile Hamas-led government. 
How events in the Middle East will play out is anyone’s guess, but in today’s information age, upholding the freedom to access it will be an important component of smart power. 
Vladimir Putin’s Potemkin Love Life 
MOSCOW – From Russia with love? 
Not in Vladimir Putin’s Russia. 
His alleged mistresses were named and proclaimed; one, it is said, sits in the Duma (parliament) as a member of Putin’s tame political party United Russia. 
But, until now, it was taboo to discuss Putin’s private life publically. 
A few newspaper editors, indeed, have been known to lose their jobs for publishing even the slightest hints about Putin’s family life. 
Vladimir and Lyudmila have rarely been seen together over the past decade, so there was plenty of gossip in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. 
So the appearance of the couple together at a ballet in the Kremlin was a unique event, and Putin milked it for all it was worth. 
A journalist, probably in connivance with Putin, had the temerity to ask him about the state of his marriage. 
He said it was over, with his stone-faced wife on hand to confirm with a silence that spoke louder than words. 
Why make such a public and staged announcement? 
After all, in Putin’s Russia, the latter-day czar can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. 
One suggestion is that Putin is seeking to divert attention from his support for Syria’s government and from increased repression of his domestic opponents (as the leading economist Sergei Guriev’s recent flight from Russia, following police harassment, demonstrated anew). 
If Russians – particularly provincial Russian women – believe that a new First Lady will provide some humanizing, empathetic influence on the hard man of the Kremlin, they may be more inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
Or, it is said, perhaps Putin plans to use next year’s Winter Olympics in Sochi as a grandiose setting for a marriage proposal – and perhaps a wedding – to whoever comes next, possibly Kabaeva. 
He wants to show that, like France’s most famous politicians, he is a worldly dragueur who can “pull” beautiful women. 
If former French President Nicolas Sarkozy could divorce and remarry a world-famous model and singer while in office, a Russian president can, too. 
Yet, Italian machismo, with its polished shoes and shiny suits, is different from the more rough-hewn Russian version. 
And no amount of European male panache can mask Putin’s inner brute. 
Indeed, one indication of the openness of a political system is whether or not a leader appears at public functions with his or her spouse. 
It is a demonstration of modernity and equality that even the secretive Chinese and North Korean leadership appear to have learned of late. The “first lady” institution is a sign that democracies see power as something to be shared, as, say, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama do. 
Nadezhda Krupskaya, the first Soviet First Lady, performed a suffragist function. 
Nikita Khrushchev’s 1950’s thaw allowed for his wife, Nina, to accompany him on trips abroad, presenting a homey image of communism with a human face. 
But, with Khrushchev’s fall, Soviet first ladies returned to the dacha. 
As with everything else in Russia, change in women’s status came with the onset of Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika. 
Boris Yeltsin’s accession to power in independent Russia saw only a partial reversal, with his peasant-gowned wife, Naina, making public appearances at his side every now and then. 
Just as Putin has created a “managed” democracy, Russians can now look forward to a “managed” Kremlin marriage – one that will attempt to flatter and sweeten their kitschy authoritarian leader in his dotage. 
The Recession Dating Game 
But are multiple downturns so unusual in periods of severe economic distress? 
All the other G-7 economies (Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom) experienced severe recessions as well during this period. 
Major middle-income trading economies, such as Brazil, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, experienced brief but even sharper declines. 
The downturn was so severe, and lasted so long, that some even used the term “depression,” before settling on “Great Recession.” 
How exactly is a recession defined? 
Different national statistical agencies define, and therefore date, such episodes somewhat differently. 
In the US, recessions are officially dated by a non-partisan, non-profit private research institution, thus wisely depoliticizing the measurement. 
The period from the point at which the economy starts to grow again until the point at which it reaches the previous peak is called the “recovery.” 
Thereafter, growth is labeled an “expansion.” 
Little wonder, then, that ordinary citizens consider a recession over only when the economy has returned to “normal,” which means that incomes are rising and jobs are no longer desperately scarce. 
A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession. 
Neither the 2001 nor the 1974/1975 US recessions met that criterion. 
In addition to real GDP, employment, income, and sales are considered, as are the depth, duration, and diffusion of the downturn throughout the overall economy. 
America had a brief, sharp recession in 1980, followed by a long and severe one in 1981/1982. 
Many economists believe that it was one major episode, and that is probably the appropriate way to think about it in a broader historical context. 
And, since they were separated by a transition from President Jimmy Carter to President Ronald Reagan, it was politically consequential that two recessions were identified. 
If we focus on real GDP and define a double dip as a historical sequence in which a period long enough to be declared a recession is followed by a period of recovery, and then quickly followed by a second outright recession, the 1980-1982 period in the US is a classic example. 
In fact, defined more loosely as a sequence that includes periods of growth followed by periods of decline, followed by further periods of growth and decline, the 1973-1975 period in the US, with eight quarters of alternating gains and losses in real GDP, was one quadruple-dip recession. 
These are not rare occurrences. 
Around the same time, Germany had this type of double dip and the UK a quadruple dip. 
Within the current recession, we have already had a double dip; a dip at the beginning of 2008, then some growth, then another long, deep dip, then renewed growth. 
If the economy declines again – a highly plausible prospect – we would have a triple dip, although perhaps not an outright second recession. 
So history suggests that economies seldom grow out of recessions continuously, without an occasional subsequent decline. 
The Red and the Blue 
Condoleeza Rice’s replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretary of State shows that America’s recent presidential election continues to produce powerful reverberations. 
But understanding what that election tells us about America is important not only for Americans, but for the world. 
This year’s presidential vote proves that America’s democracy is healthy, but that some things could be better. 
While some Democrats remain bitter, there is little serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush’s victory. 
America remains closely divided into red states (Republican) and blue states (Democrat). 
If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (albeit with a minority of the popular vote). 
More fundamentally, there is something unseemly about electing presidents without a popular majority. 
So it is time for a serious debate about amending the constitution to abolish the Electoral College. 
Some observers also complain about the divisive negative rhetoric and advertising that characterized the campaign. 
But this should be seen in historical perspective. 
In the era of the Founding Fathers, newspapers were extremely partisan, and George Washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language. 
In general, an incumbent president with a growing economy is likely to be re-elected. 
In that sense, what was surprising about Bush’s re-election was how thin his majority was. 
In large part, this was because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War. 
Bush countered with concerns about security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion rights. 
In the end, security and cultural populism trumped economic populism. 
Interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked (after they voted) about which issues mattered most to them. 
The largest number (22%) answered “moral values,” comparison to 20% who cited the economy and 19% who mentioned terrorism. 
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term. 
A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided. 
Some call it “Coastopia.” 
But the division is not that sharp. 
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are clustered in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes. 
But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public. 
At first, this seems puzzling, because they should have an incentive to move to the vote-rich middle. 
The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe. 
The Reform Game 
Reform, when long discussed but never implemented, can do far more harm than good. 
Anticipation of a reform – say, of pension rules, the health system, or unemployment benefits – worries everyone who might feel the impact. 
Still the talk does not stop, nor does the fall in consumer confidence. 
Germany’s recent experience provides a worrying example of this vicious circle. 
Reform of Germany’s generous social system has claimed the front pages for German papers for more than ten years. 
Out on the street, pessimism runs rampant. 
For two years now, the growth rate of private consumption (measured at constant prices) has been negative: - 1% in 2002, -0.5% in 2003. 
In the case of Germany, one has to go back to the early 1980’s to see similar negative numbers in consumption growth. 
Depressed consumption and higher savings have affected all age groups, but the relatively old have been more prone to the trend than the relatively young. 
But the saving rate even in households in their thirties has risen along with concern about reforms. 
Not surprisingly, elderly people cut consumption more. 
So they are forced to rely on their savings, and virtually stop consuming. 
Put this in the context of a rapidly aging population and the effects on overall consumption are dramatic. 
The reason is simple: as the 2006 elections approach, reforms have been shifted off the political agenda. 
If a government does not have the will to adopt a reform program, then the best thing it can do is stop talking about reform altogether. 
This may start happening in Germany and for the same reason: consumer confidence remains lackluster. 
The common wisdom is that to faster European growth requires a boost from domestic demand. 
But this will not happen as long as politicians keep talking about reforms, while doing virtually nothing to realize them. 
On the contrary, all they are doing is spreading pessimism. 
Europe has two ways ahead. 
Doing nothing but talking, which is Europe’s current model of inaction, is the worst possible course. 
The Refugee Dilemma 
Some fled in terror from the invading army, some were expelled - the usual complex, morally problematic picture that emerges in such situations. 
Although overwhelmed, the Greek Cypriot community reacted with humanity, solidarity, and prudence. 
No UN-sponsored refugee agency was established to help the refugees. 
Government loans were offered for housing construction. 
In many cases, refugees built their own new homes. 
Businesses were encouraged with government subsidies and loans. 
Schools and training centers were established. 
Within a few years, the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern, Greek Cypriot sector of the island. 
Not one incident of Greek Cypriot terrorism or violence against Turkish occupation has occurred in more than a quarter of a century. 
This is also one of the reasons few people have ever heard about the Greek Cypriot refugees. 
The Greek Cypriot example shows that it is simply not true that the occupied have no recourse other than violence and terrorism. 
Recourse to violence and terror is a moral and strategic choice. 
The Greek Cypriots chose the path of non-violence; the Palestinians chose the opposite route. 
There is always a choice, and there are always consequences. 
The Relative Unimportance of Global Warming 
Global warming has become the preeminent concern of our time. 
Negotiating a follow-up treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, they argue, requires that we seek even deeper cuts in the pollution that causes global warming. 
But they are wrong about our priorities, and they are advocating an inefficient remedy. 
To be sure, global warming is real, and it is caused by CO2. 
The trouble is that today’s best climate models show that immediate action will do little good. 
Likewise, the economic models tell us that the cost would be substantial ­– at least $150 billion a year. 
Global warming will mainly harm developing countries, because they are poorer and therefore more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. 
So early action on global warming is basically a costly way of doing very little for much richer people far in the future. 
We need to ask ourselves if this should, in fact, be our first priority. 
Of course, in the best of all worlds, we would not need to prioritize. 
We could do all good things. 
But we don’t. 
So we have to ask the hard question: if we can’t do it all, what should we do first? 
Some of the world’s top economists – including four Nobel laureates – answered this question at the Copenhagen Consensus in 2004, listing all major policies for improving the world according to priority. 
They found that dealing with HIV/AIDS, hunger, free trade, and malaria were the world’s top priorities. 
This was where we could do the most good for our money. 
On the other hand, the experts rated immediate responses to climate change at the bottom of the world’s priorities. 
Indeed, the panel called these ventures – including the Kyoto Protocol – “bad projects,” simply because they cost more than the good that they do. 
The Copenhagen Consensus gives us great hope because it shows us that there are so many good things that we can do. 
For $27 billion, we could prevent 28 million people from getting HIV. 
For $12 billion we could cut malaria cases by more than a billion a year. 
Instead of helping richer people inefficiently far into the future, we can do immense good right now. 
This does not mean losing sight of the need to tackle climate change. 
But the Kyoto approach focuses on early cuts, which are expensive and do little good. 
Instead, we should be concentrating on investments in making energy without CO2 emissions viable for our descendants. 
This would be much cheaper and ultimately much more effective in dealing with global warming. 
The US and Britain have begun to tout this message. 
It would involve all nations, with richer nations naturally paying the larger share, and perhaps developing nations being phased in. 
Such a massive global research effort would also have potentially huge innovation spin-offs. 
In the long run, such actions are likely to make a much greater impact on global warming than Kyoto-style responses. 
By this standard, global warming doesn’t come close. 
The Renminbi Goes Forth 
So far, however, the RMB’s appreciation against the dollar has been slow. 
Will the pace of appreciation accelerate enough to satisfy American demands? 
If it does, will global imbalances disappear sooner? 
It is hard to argue that the RMB is not undervalued, given China’s large and persistent current-account and capital-account surpluses. 
But, despite ending the dollar peg, faster appreciation of the RMB seems unlikely for the foreseeable future. 
Delay has made current-account rebalancing via RMB appreciation costly. 
And now China faces a dilemma. 
As a result of the global financial crisis, China’s export growth in 2009 dropped by 34% compared to 2008. 
In the first seven months of 2010, China’s trade surplus was $84 billion, down 21.2% from January-July 2009. 
This large, steady fall in the country’s trade surplus makes the Chinese government hesitant to allow the RMB to appreciate significantly, for fear of the lagged impact on the trade balance. 
But the PBC is also reluctant to buy dollars constantly. 
The more the PBC intervenes, the larger the national welfare losses that China may suffer in the future. 
The Chinese government must, therefore, strike a balance between protecting China’s export sector and preserving its national welfare. 
True, commerce ministry officials recently declared their wish to see a further fall of China’s trade surplus in 2010. 
But RMB appreciation is not the preferred instrument for achieving this goal. 
Thus, nothing dramatic will happen to the RMB exchange rate in the near term – unless something dramatic happens. 
At the same time, the effect of currency appreciation on the trade balance should not be exaggerated. 
The RMB appreciated by 18.6% in real effective terms, and by 16% in dollar terms, from June 2005 to August 2008. 
Yet, from 2006 to 2008, China’s annual exports grew 23.4%, outpacing import growth of 19.7%. 
Exchange rates are just one of many factors that affect trade balances. 
For China’s, the income effect of global demand is significantly larger than the price effect of the exchange rate. 
But if the RMB is allowed to float, isn’t a balanced trade account likely? 
Probably not. 
As a result, balance-of-payments equilibrium would be reached at a certain exchange-rate level, but a current-account surplus (albeit smaller) would still exist. 
America should not pin too much hope on a weakening dollar to correct its trade imbalances. 
For the US, the fundamental cause of imbalances is not a strong dollar, but America’s over-consumption and over-borrowing. 
Of course, RMB appreciation may displace Chinese goods sold in the US. 
But if the US fails to narrow its savings gap, its current-account deficit will not disappear, regardless of where the dollar goes. 
For both China and America, the RMB-dollar exchange rate is important for achieving growth and a more balanced current account. 
But that dual objective requires structural change in the Chinese and US economies. 
The Resisted Rise of Segolene Royal 
Today, the reverse seems true. 
While the race is not over, Nicolas Sarkozy has emerged as the consistent favorite in the polls, as well as of those who declared “him” nearly defeated in early December. 
The new consensus can be described as follows: Ségolène Royal cannot defeat Nicolas Sarkozy, but Sarkozy can defeat himself. 
Why has the Socialist candidate, the first woman who had a serious chance to be elected President of France, fallen from grace so quickly? 
And why has Sarkozy proved to be so resilient, despite the often negative passions aroused by his personality? 
If Ségolène Royal is defeated, it will not be because she is a woman, but in spite of it. 
The French are ready for a woman, but perhaps not this one. 
She is beautiful, energetic, resolute, and in many ways surprising. 
But Royal has so far failed to rally her camp behind her. 
Her campaign’s combination of authoritarianism and confusion, if not sheer incompetence, is sapping her supporters’ morale while confirming the deep reservations of her opponents. 
Whatever their political preferences, many French voters have the feeling that an “amateur” is facing a “professional.” 
Royal’s emphasis on the concept of participatory democracy – “Tell me what you want, I will be your spokesperson” – has so far shown itself to have limited appeal. 
In other terms, they don’t want only a receptive ear, but a reassuring, authoritative, and competent figure. 
But the campaign is also proving the resilience of “classical politics.” 
Royal may have presented herself as a “post-modern” politician, but it is a “classical” politician who seems to be winning. 
Indeed, the reverse seems to be true, which perhaps reflects the tendency of French voters to adopt a positive view of departing presidents. 
Chirac himself has orchestrated his departure with a grace, presenting himself in the best possible light with personal confidences and public speeches. 
It is as if France were now seized by a kind of nostalgic generosity toward a presidency that had been marked by suspicion and derision. 
In fact, the persistence of strong reservations about both Royal and Sarkozy helps explain the surge in popularity for a third candidate, Francois Bayrou, a traditional centrist, pro-European politician. 
In our media-dominated age, personalities ultimately matter more than programs, which means that elimination prevails over selection. 
That process seems to favor Sarkozy. 
An anybody-but-Sarkozy reflex may exist in some circles of French society, but, in order to prevail, a credible alternative is required. 
So far, Royal has failed to play that role. 
The Resistible Rise of Hindu Fascism 
One night a year ago, a friend called me. 
Weeping, she told me of her friend, a woman caught by a mob, her stomach ripped open and stuffed with burning rags. 
What Hindu scripture preaches this? 
What Koran verse required those travellers to be roasted alive? 
The more India's Hindus and Muslims call attention to their differences by slaughtering each other, the less there is that distinguishes them. 
They worship at the same altar, apostles of the same murderous god, whoever he is. 
In parliament, the government has unveiled a portrait of Vinayak Savarkar, a pre-independence Hindu nationalist, one of whose followers assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. 
But once Muslims are "shown their place," will milk and Coca-Cola flow across the land? 
Or will some fresh hate arise? 
Will its target be Adivasis, Buddhists, Christians, Dalits, Parsis, Sikhs? 
Those who speak English? 
Those with thick lips? 
What depraved vision imagines India without the spectacular anarchy of its many cultures? 
The parallels between contemporary India and pre-Nazi Germany are chilling, but not surprising. 
Many Hindu nationalists are frank about their admiration for Hitler. 
Luckily, we don't yet have a Hitler. 
Instead, we have, the hydra-headed Sangh Parivar - the "joint family" of Hindu political/cultural organizations. 
Sangh Parivar's genius is its ability to be all things to all people. 
Of course, every kind of pogrom - against castes, tribes, religions - has been seen here. 
In 1984, following Indira Gandhi's assassination, the ruling Congress Party presided over the massacre of 3,000 Sikhs. 
But whereas Congress whipped up communal hatred undercover and in shame, communal division is part of Sangh Parivar's mandate. 
For years it has injected a slow-release poison into society. 
Hundreds of thousands of children and young people are being weaned on religious hatred and falsified history. 
Their curriculum is as dangerous as that found in the Pakistani and Afghani madrassas that spawned the Taliban. 
Whenever hostility between India and Pakistan is cranked up, hostility toward Muslims grows. 
Increasingly, Indian nationalism means Hindu nationalism, which is based not on self-respect, but on a hatred of the "Other" - not just Pakistanis, but all Muslims. 
The incipient, creeping fascism that results has been groomed by our "democratic" institutions. 
Everything flirts with it--parliament, the press, the police, and the administration. 
Fighting religious fascism means winning back minds and hearts. 
It means demanding accountability from public institutions and listening to the powerless. 
It means fighting dispossession and the everyday violence of poverty. 
It means not allowing newspapers and TV to be hijacked by spurious passions and staged theatrics designed to divert attention from everything else. 
It does not mean banning communally minded madrassas, but rather working toward the day when they are voluntarily abandoned. 
Like termites, India's Hindu fascists have weakened the foundations of our constitution, parliament, and the courts - the backbone of every democracy. 
But it's futile to blame politicians and demand from them a morality of which they are incapable. 
If India's politicians let us down, it is because we allowed it. 
Our fascists didn't create today's grievances. 
Fascist Hindus seized upon these grievances, mobilizing people by using the lowest common denominator - religion. 
Not of something they achieved, but of something they happen to be. Or, more accurately, something they happen not to be. 
Unfortunately, no quick fix exists. 
Fascism can be defeated only if those outraged by it commit themselves to social justice with an intensity that equals their indignation. 
The Resource Curse Revisited 
Yet some countries with abundant natural resources do perform better than others, and some have done well. 
Why is the spell of the resource curse cast so unequally? 
Thirty years ago, Indonesia and Nigeria - both dependent on oil - had comparable per capita incomes. 
Today, Indonesia's per capita income is four times that of Nigeria. 
Indeed, Nigeria's per capita income (as measured in constant dollars circa 1995) has fallen. 
A similar pattern holds true in Sierra Leone and Botswana. 
Both are rich in diamonds. 
Yet Botswana averaged 8.7% annual economic growth over the past thirty years, while Sierra Leone plunged into civil strife. 
The failures in the oil-rich Middle East are legion. 
Economists put forward three reasons for the dismal performance of some richly endowed countries: 
• First, the prospect of riches orients official efforts to seizing a larger share of the pie, rather than creating a larger pie. 
The result of this wealth grab is often war. 
• Second, natural resource prices are volatile, and managing this volatility is hard. 
Lenders provide money when times are good, but want their money back when, say, energy prices plummet. 
(As the old adage has it, banks only like to lend to those who do not need money.) 
For example, an inflow of oil money often leads to currency appreciation - a phenomenon called the Dutch Disease . 
So abundant natural wealth often creates rich countries with poor people. 
Two thirds of the people in Venezuela, the Latin American country with the largest oil deposits, live in poverty. 
No wonder that they are demanding that the small group of those who benefit from the country's wealth start to share it. 
Fortunately, as we have become aware of these problems, we have learned much about what can be done about them. 
The Dutch disease, however, is one of the more intractable consequences of oil and resource wealth, at least for poor countries. 
Bring it in only gradually. But in most developing countries, such a policy is viewed as using oil money to help someone else's economy. 
Some countries, notably Nigeria, are trying to implement these lessons. 
Nigeria has proposed creating stabilization funds, and, in the future, it will sell its natural resources in transparent, competitive bidding processes. 
Western governments can help with common-sense reforms. 
Secret bank accounts not only support terrorism, but also facilitate the corruption that undermines development. 
Similarly, transparency would be encouraged if only payments that are fully documented were tax deductible. 
Violent conflict is fed and its effects worsened by massive sales of arms by Western governments to developing countries. 
This should be stopped. 
Abundant natural resources can and should be a blessing, not a curse. 
We know what must be done. 
What is missing is the political will to make it so. 
The Responsibility to Protect Libyans 
ABU DHABI – Sovereignty is not a license to kill. 
There is no clearer case for its application than in Libya today. 
A bigger bloodbath seems inescapable if he does not step down. 
The need for “collective, timely, and decisive” action is overwhelming. 
Such measures, like the steps being taken in the UN Human Rights Council and elsewhere, are necessary to demonstrate that Qaddafi has no remaining international support. 
They are coercive, but they fall short of the threat or use of military force. 
Will they be enough to stop the killing? 
Is it time to apply and enforce a no-fly zone? 
Or to go further still and send in ground forces with a mandate to do what it takes? 
This is a difficult call. 
Not even the most passionate advocate of the responsibility to protect can pretend otherwise. 
That poses a huge risk of hostage-taking or other reprisals against any intervening country’s nationals still in Libya. 
An invasion force, assuming that one could be mustered on short notice, would raise the stakes higher still. 
It is important to keep in perspective what the responsibility to protect is about, and what the principle was designed to achieve. 
That part of the job is now fairly well accomplished. 
And the international condemnation of Qaddafi’s atrocities today has been swift, unqualified, and effectively unanimous. 
Nobody is claiming that sovereignty confers immunity; the shift in the normative consensus is more or less complete. 
That has proved harder, as experiences in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sri Lanka have demonstrated. 
Sanctions, embargoes, and diplomatic isolation are the absolute minimum in terms of what is required. 
If these measures do not bite immediately, and the carnage continues, there will be no alternative but to do more. 
Military options should always be a last resort, but they can’t be excluded in extreme cases, and Libya is as extreme as it gets. 
A no-fly zone will be easier to contemplate as the last vulnerable expatriates leave the country, and planning for its application should be rapidly advanced. 
For all that it has done so far, the ball remains in the Security Council’s court. 
Not only is the credibility of the responsibility-to-protect principle at stake, but also its own. 
The Cooperation Crisis 
PARIS – The rise of emerging economies worldwide has generated much optimism, in terms not only of economic development, but also of global cooperation. 
But the shift to a multipolar world order has not bolstered multilateralism. 
Consider the muddle in the United Nations Security Council over Syria’s civil war. 
Now, these countries are largely rejecting R2P, viewing it as a device employed by Western governments to legitimize their attempts to infringe upon national sovereignty. 
In this sense, Russia and China now exercise de facto control over the formal international legality of the use of force. 
Only the US, the United Kingdom, and France remain willing to use force if it is deemed necessary. 
But viewing intervention in Syria within the paradigm of Western messianism is a mistake. 
After all, in Syria, as in Libya, the forces challenging the government are not a creature of Western manipulation. 
They are indigenous – and they are asking the West for help. 
The legal basis for military intervention may be weak, but Syria is no Iraq, either. 
Security is not the only area where sovereignty concerns have superseded multilateralism. 
In 2008, the US abandoned its commitment to the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round of global trade negotiations. 
But, while the world may be happy to pretend that bilateral cooperation will revitalize multilateralism, nobody should be fooled. 
The WTO will survive, but its centrality in the trade system is rapidly diminishing. 
Even cooperation on climate change is crumbling, with the US and China rejecting the multilateral, top-down approach to policymaking. 
Rather than being subject to an internationally agreed standard, the US and China want the fight against climate change to begin with countries’ individual commitments. 
But this new, bottom-up framework, in which states determine the conditions for a multilateral agreement, lacks an authority to establish standards. 
Multilateralism requires minimal consensus on global rules and norms among all major powers. 
The Retreat of Global Democracy 
A nasty, unintended side-effect of globalization is its corrosive effect on democracy. 
Democracy means many things, but at its core it requires that people choose their rulers and that votes be weighted equally. 
But globalization means that nations and peoples can exert an asymmetric influence. 
Cuba, however, can do little to hurt America's economy. 
Likewise, China can injure Taiwan in ways that Taiwan cannot reciprocate. 
Of course, the powerful have always encroached on the sovereignty of others. 
Take the story, perhaps apocryphal, of an Indian diplomat showing a map of South Asia to Stalin. 
"India is a very big country," Stalin observed, and then pointing to Sri Lanka said, "What is the name of this little Indian island?" 
"That is not an Indian island, sir," the diplomat replied, "it is a sovereign nation." 
"Why? "Stalin asked. 
Foremost is money. 
Instantaneous electronic links and an improving system of global guarantees allow capital to flow across national boundaries as never before. 
Rapid withdrawal of such capital can have devastating effects, as we saw in 1997 when Asia's super-performing economies succumbed to financial crisis. 
People in vulnerable nations have very little say in the imposition of these policies. 
Trade sanctions for political/security ends also serve the same function. 
Another consequence of the freer flow of capital is a greater intertwining of different markets. 
The large presence of overseas investors is the cause here. 
Suppose a New Yorker buys shares in the Mumbai stock market. 
For that, dollars are converted into rupees, which are used to buy shares. 
The aim is not to hold rupees but to make money and eventually re-convert to dollars. 
Suppose, then, that the rupee's exchange rate begins to fall. 
The foreign investor will naturally want to sell off Indian stocks. 
What can be done about the erosion of global democracy and accountability? 
Utopian schemes such as a global government or a global bank answerable to all nations are a distant dream. 
Today, equity is violated in most international organizations through at least two routes. 
First, there is the open channel, which gives a larger share of votes to the nations contributing more to organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank. 
The second route is the lack of transparency in decision-making. 
Big business and the military are able to push through their interests much more in Pakistan than in India because India's government is more open to scrutiny. 
The same goes for international organizations. 
Powerful nations, by virtue of contributing senior personnel and money, gain greater access. 
Decisions taken behind opaque walls are more likely to be diverted to their interests. Take the WTO. 
This is because of what can be called the "green room" effect, that is, what goes on behind the scenes. 
If the WTO is to be a democratic institution, it must not allow its green room to be hijacked by a few. 
This problem is most obvious when drafting international labor standards. 
Although supposedly designed in the interests of the workers in developing countries, the biggest opposition to them comes from poor countries, and rightly so. 
This is not surprising given the greater access of rich countries. 
This is because democracy within a nation is a settled idea. 
When the idea of "one-person one-vote" arose, feudal landlords predicted chaos in the decision-making process. 
How wrong they were. 
For the sake of global stability, economic efficiency and also the fight against terrorism we must instill greater democracy within our international organizations. 
This may not be in the immediate individual interest of every state, especially big and powerful ones, but is, in the long run, in the enlightened interest of all of humanity collectively. 
The Retreat of Macroeconomic Policy 
For decades, I have confidently taught my students about the rise of governments that take on responsibility for the state of the economy. 
But the political reaction to the Great Recession has changed the way we should think about this issue. 
There were three reasons, all of which vanished by the end of WWII. 
They had little personally at stake in high capacity utilization and low unemployment, but a great deal at stake in stable prices. 
They wanted hard money above everything. 
Second, the working classes that were hardest-hit by high unemployment generally did not have the vote. 
Third, knowledge about the economy was in its adolescence. 
Knowledge of how different government policies could affect the overall level of spending was closely held. 
With the exception of the United States’ free-silver movement, it was not the subject of general political and public intellectual discussion. 
All three of these factors vanished between the world wars. 
At least, that is what I said when I lectured on economic history back in 2007. 
And the working classes all have the vote. 
I was wrong. That is precisely what is happening. 
How did we get here? 
Why are politicians not terrified of their displeasure? 
Economic questions abound, too. 
Why are the principles of nominal income determination, which I thought largely settled since 1829, now being questioned? 
It is now clear that the right-wing opponents to the Obama administration’s policies are not objecting to the use of fiscal measures to stabilize nominal spending. 
They are, instead, objecting to the very idea that government should try to serve a stabilizing macroeconomic role. 
Today, the flow of economy-wide spending is low. 
That is entirely standard. 
The only slight difference is that the Fed is buying seven-year Treasury notes rather than three-month Treasury bills. 
It has no choice: the seven-year notes are the shortest-duration Treasury bonds that now pay interest. 
The Fed cannot reduce short-term interest rates below zero, so it is attempting via this policy of “quantitative easing” to reduce longer-term interest rates. 
Yet America’s right wing objects to this, for reasons that largely remain mysterious: what, at the level of economic theory, is the objection to quantitative easing? 
Blather about Federal Reserve currency manipulation and excessive risk-taking is not worthy of an answer. 
Still, here we are. 
The Return of 1948 
TEL AVIV – The forthcoming United Nation’s conference commemorating the 60th anniversary of UNRWA (The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) could not come at a better moment. 
That demand brought the quest for peace back to its fundamentals, where the question of the refugees is bound to play a central role. 
Netanyahu’s intention was essentially to force the Palestinians into admitting that the right of return of refugees applies only to the Palestinian state, not Israel. 
It is as if the voice of the diaspora were being silenced in Palestine. 
This could mark a sea change in the evolution of Palestinian nationalism. 
In Zionism, the Jewish community in Palestine was the focus of decision making, with the Jewish Diaspora a strategic back-up. 
As a result, the Palestinian community in the occupied territories was always subservient to the primacy of the Palestinian Diaspora. 
When it sought to assume a leading role – during the first Intifada in 1987, for example, its effort was suppressed by the diaspora-based PLO. 
Fayaadism, by contrast, seeks the “Zionization” of the Palestinian national movement. 
In the peace process as it has been conducted up to now, the Israelis always wanted to concentrate on the issues of 1967 – that is, land and security. 
It looks as if now the roles have been inversed. 
Indeed, despite of the rise of Fayaadism, the Palestinian national movement will be careful not to betray its real sources of legitimacy: the ethos of dispossession and the refugee. 
The decisions taken at the last Fatah Convention were explicit in calling for the refugees to “return to their homes and cities.” 
Peace is frequently not about justice but about stability. 
Israel should develop enough self-confidence in its solidity as a nation to integrate into its schools’ curriculum the tragedy of the Palestinian Naqbah. 
Israel’s consolation would be that the Palestinians, too, will have to come to terms with their share of responsibility for the calamities that have befallen them. 
Only an acceptable deal on the refugees can definitely close the 1948 file – and only then can the conflict in Palestine end. 
The Return of American Realism 
NEW YORK – There are many recurring debates in American foreign policy – for example, isolationism versus internationalism, and unilateralism versus multilateralism. 
This debate between “realists” and “idealists” is intense and long-standing. 
George W. Bush was the most recent “idealist” proponent of making democracy promotion the main priority for US foreign policy. 
It was, of course, his father, George H.W. Bush, who was a strong representative of the alternative, “realist” approach to American foreign policy. 
Much of this debate can be viewed through the lens of American involvement with Iraq. 
George W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 2003 to change the government. 
Nor did he intervene on behalf of the Shia and Kurdish uprisings that erupted just after the war ended early in 1991. 
President Barack Obama appears to agree with this realist approach. 
The new US policy toward Afghanistan makes no mention of trying to transform that country into a democracy. 
This shift is also evident in US policy toward China. 
Speaking during her trip to Asia in February, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made clear that human rights issues would be a secondary concern in US-China relations. 
US support for Russia’s admission to the World Trade Organization was unconditional. 
This change in US foreign policy is both desirable and necessary. 
Mature democracies do tend to act more responsibly, but immature democracies can easily succumb to populism and nationalism. 
It is difficult and time-consuming to build mature democracies. 
Pressing problems, such as the economic crisis, nuclear proliferation, and climate change, will not wait. 
The good news is that history shows that it is possible to make peace with and work with non-democracies. 
Israel, for example, has had peaceful relations with non-democratic Egypt and Jordan for more than three decades. 
The US and the Soviet Union cooperated in limited ways (for example, in controlling nuclear arms) despite fundamental differences. 
This is not to say that promoting democracy will have no role in American foreign policy. 
It will, and it should. 
Barack Obama’s foreign policy will thus resemble that of George Bush – the father, that is, not the son. 
The Return of Franco-German Leadership 
PARIS – Whoever wins September’s parliamentary election in Germany, the time has come once again for a major Franco-German initiative. 
Are there alternatives to Franco-German leadership of the European Union? 
Joining Great Britain with them in a Club of Three would be a good idea, but it is out of the question nowadays. 
Britain has largely excluded itself from any leadership role in Europe. 
Europe simply cannot count on the British, at least for a while. 
The idea of a Club of Six, floated by Nicolas Sarkozy early in his presidency, was always abstract and is now untenable. 
Given Silvio Berlusconi’s sexcapades, the Italy that he leads cannot be taken seriously, while Spain is out of the running for an EU leadership role, owing to its dire economic conditions. 
Since the other 21 EU members never liked the idea of a Club of Six to begin with, it is just as well that such a vision has been buried, probably forever. 
So where but France and Germany can Europe turn for leadership? 
Only Germany and France, acting together, can convey to Europe’s citizens and to the world the sense that the EU is at long last waking up to today’s global realities. 
Of course, it is impossible to underestimate the combination of suspicion, tension, and exasperation that characterizes Franco-German relations lately. 
To a large extent, Germany has become a “second France” in Europe, at a time when France is more French than ever. 
And they are not only putting their respective nationalisms first. 
As long as each remains convinced that no alternative to cooperation exists within the EU, and that European cooperation remains a priority for both, it should not be overly difficult to restore their leadership. 
After all, France and Germany are closer to each other on many key topics than they have been for a long time. 
And both countries would probably subscribe to the following formulation: “Turkey’s future is with Europe, but not necessarily in the European Union, at least in the foreseeable future.” 
The fundamental question about how to deal with Russia remains a divisive issue, however. 
France and Germany have different sensitivities on the subject, which is both natural and inevitable, as these differences reflect both geography and history. 
Germany is not only much closer physically to Russia; it is also much more dependent on Russia in terms of energy security. 
France must not delude itself: Germany is not about to convert to nuclear energy to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas. 
A spectacular Franco-German security initiative following the election in Germany, accompanied by a joint message to the Kremlin, would also have the benefit of sending a message to the rest of the EU, particularly to its Václav Klauses: “If you decide to paralyze the Union through stubborn ill will, you will only end up excluding yourselves, rather than dictating Europe’s fate.” 
Bretton Woods III 
More important, can the post-crisis global economy enjoy both growth and balance? 
To answer these questions, it is important to understand the imbalances’ underlying dynamics. 
An economy’s current account is the difference between its investment rate and its savings rate. 
In 2007, the United States had a savings rate of 14.6% of GDP, but an investment rate of 19.6%, generating a current-account deficit. 
By contrast, China had a fixed investment rate of 41.7% of GDP and a savings rate of 51.9%, reflected in a large surplus. 
Since 2007, the US current-account deficit has narrowed, but not because of a higher savings rate. 
Rather, the external deficit has been squeezed by a collapse in investment activity, while America’s overall savings rate has fallen below 13% of GDP, owing to worsening government finances. 
Meanwhile, China’s savings rate remains stubbornly high. 
The surplus has narrowed because investment has been ramped up even higher, to roughly 49% of GDP. 
In other words, the Americans save even less today than they did before the crisis erupted, and the Chinese invest even more. 
Any future recovery in the US economy will almost certainly trigger a revival in investment activity. 
China has the opposite problem. 
Indeed, a stronger currency can paradoxically feed external surpluses, while discouraging investment in export-oriented industries. 
The implication is that the post-crisis global economy will not be characterized by balance, but by a return to large macroeconomic imbalances. 
But, although many economists will consider this problematic, history shows that symbiotic imbalances have characterized virtually all periods of global economic expansion. 
The Roman Empire ran a persistent trade deficit with India for centuries. 
Although the resulting outflow of gold caused monetary debasement in the Roman Empire, Indo-Roman trade remained the backbone of the global economy. 
Similarly, Spain ran persistent deficits in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, paid for by Andean silver. 
The resulting flood of liquidity caused a global boom that benefited economies from Elizabethan England to Mughal India. 
And 1870-1913, another period of rapid growth and globalization, was not characterized by balance; it was funded by the United Kingdom, acting as the world’s “bank.” 
In the last 60 years, the US has underpinned global growth by running persistent current-account deficits. 
Under the Bretton Woods system, the US ran deficits that enabled war-torn Europe and Japan to rebuild. 
In return, Europe funded the US deficits. 
The system broke down when European countries, particularly France, decided to stop funding those deficits. 
But the economic model persisted, with Asian economies stepping in to finance the US deficits, while using the US market to grow rapidly. 
China is the latest and largest beneficiary of the economic model dubbed “Bretton Woods II.” 
Clearly, periods of global growth are almost always characterized by symbiotic imbalances. 
But, while each of these episodes was characterized by macroeconomic distortions caused by the imbalances, they lasted for years, or even decades. So, the real question is what the next generation of symbiotic imbalances will look like. 
It is likely that China will soon return to running very large current-account surpluses – potentially large enough to fund the US, with plenty left over for the rest of the world. 
As this capital cascades through the global financial system, it will re-inflate the economy. 
Like all imbalanced systems, it will have its distortions, but the arrangement could last for many years. 
The Return of Industrial Policy 
CAMBRIDGE – British Prime Minister Gordon Brown promotes it as a vehicle for creating high-skill jobs. 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy talks about using it to keep industrial jobs in France. 
The World Bank’s chief economist, Justin Lin, openly supports it to speed up structural change in developing nations. 
McKinsey is advising governments on how to do it right. 
Industrial policy is back. 
In fact, industrial policy never went out of fashion. 
China is a case in point. 
Its phenomenal manufacturing prowess rests in large part on public assistance to new industries. 
State-owned enterprises have acted as incubators for technical skills and managerial talent. 
Local-content requirements have spawned productive supplier industries in automotive and electronics products. 
Generous export incentives have helped firms break into competitive global markets. 
Chile, which is often portrayed as a free-market paradise, is another example. 
The government has played a crucial role in developing every significant new export that the country produces. 
Chilean grapes broke into world markets thanks to publicly financed R&D. Forest products were heavily subsidized by none other than General Augusto Pinochet. 
And the highly successful salmon industry is the creation of Fundación Chile, a quasi-public venture fund. 
But when it comes to industrial policy, it is the United States that takes the cake. 
It is used almost exclusively to browbeat political opponents with accusations of Stalinist economic designs. 
As Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner explains in his book Boulevard of Broken Dreams, US Department of Defense contracts played a crucial role in accelerating the early growth of Silicon Valley. 
The Internet, possibly the most significant innovation of our time, grew out of a Defense Department project initiated in 1969. 
Nor is America’s embrace of industrial policy a matter of historical interest only. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, the US Department of Energy (DOE) alone is planning to spend more than $40 billion in loans and grants to encourage private firms to develop green technologies, such as electric cars, new batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels. 
During the first three quarters on 2009, private venture capital firms invested less than $3 billion combined in this sector. 
The shift toward embracing industrial policy is therefore a welcome acknowledgement of what sensible analysts of economic growth have always known: developing new industries often requires a nudge from government. 
The nudge can take the form of subsidies, loans, infrastructure, and other kinds of support. 
But scratch the surface of any new successful industry anywhere, and more likely than not you will find government assistance lurking beneath. 
The real question about industrial policy is not whether it should be practiced, but how. 
Here are three important principles to keep in mind. 
First, industrial policy is a state of mind rather than a list of specific policies. 
Through deliberation councils, supplier development forums, investment advisory councils, sectoral round-tables, or private-public venture funds, collaboration aims to elicit information about investment opportunities and bottlenecks. 
This requires a government that is “embedded” in the private sector, but not in bed with it. 
Given its risks and the gap between its social and private benefits, innovation requires rents – returns above what competitive markets provide. 
That is why all countries have a patent system. 
But open-ended incentives have their own costs: they can raise consumer prices and bottle up resources in unproductive activities. 
That is why patents expire. 
The same principle needs to apply to all government efforts to spawn new industries. 
To guard against abuse and capture, industrial policy needs be carried out in a transparent and accountable manner, and its processes must be open to new entrants as well as incumbents. 
The standard rap against industrial policy is that governments cannot pick winners. 
Of course they can’t, but that is largely irrelevant. 
What determines success in industrial policy is not the ability to pick winners, but the capacity to let the losers go – a much less demanding requirement. 
Uncertainty ensures that even optimal policies will lead to mistakes. 
The New Mercantilist Challenge 
CAMBRIDGE – The history of economics is largely a struggle between two opposing schools of thought, “liberalism” and “mercantilism.” 
Economic liberalism, with its emphasis on private entrepreneurship and free markets, is today’s dominant doctrine. 
But its intellectual victory has blinded us to the great appeal – and frequent success – of mercantilist practices. 
Today, mercantilism is typically dismissed as an archaic and blatantly erroneous set of ideas about economic policy. 
Adam Smith’s 1776 treatise The Wealth of Nations masterfully demolished many of these ideas. 
Mercantilist theorists such as Thomas Mun were in fact strong proponents of capitalism; they just propounded a different model than liberalism. 
The liberal model views the state as necessarily predatory and the private sector as inherently rent-seeking. 
So it advocates a strict separation between the state and private business. 
Mercantilism, by contrast, offers a corporatist vision in which the state and private business are allies and cooperate in pursuit of common objectives, such as domestic economic growth or national power. 
The mercantilist model can be derided as state capitalism or cronyism. 
Lagging economies have not failed to notice that mercantilism can be their friend. 
Even in Britain, classical liberalism arrived only in the mid-nineteenth century – that is, after the country had become the world’s dominant industrial power. 
A second difference between the two models lies in whether consumer or producer interests are privileged. 
For liberals, consumers are king. 
Mercantilists, by contrast, emphasize the productive side of the economy. 
For them, a sound economy requires a sound production structure. And consumption needs to be underpinned by high employment at adequate wages. 
These different models have predictable implications for international economic policies. 
Today’s China is the leading bearer of the mercantilist torch, though Chinese leaders would never admit it – too much opprobrium still attaches to the term. 
Much of China’s economic miracle is the product of an activist government that has supported, stimulated, and openly subsidized industrial producers – both domestic and foreign. 
Moreover, export-oriented firms continue to benefit from a range of tax incentives. 
From the liberal perspective, these export subsidies impoverish Chinese consumers while benefiting consumers in the rest of the world. 
From the mercantilist perspective, however, these are simply the costs of building a modern economy and setting the stage for long-term prosperity. 
As the example of export subsidies shows, the two models can co-exist happily in the world economy. 
Liberals should be happy to have their consumption subsidized by mercantilists. 
We have now reached the end of this happy coexistence. 
Medium-term growth prospects for the American and European economies range from moderate to bleak. 
Unemployment will remain a major headache and preoccupation for policymakers. 
So mercantilist pressures will likely intensify in the advanced countries. 
As a result, the new economic environment will produce more tension than accommodation between countries pursuing liberal and mercantilist paths. 
It may also reignite long-dormant debates about the type of capitalism that produces the greatest prosperity. 
The Return of Post-Communism 
The collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe 15 years ago brought vast and positive democratic changes. 
Can a new balance between the democratic ethos and the undertows of the region’s political history and culture be found? 
But these anti-communist antibodies also worked against the universal acceptance among Poles of liberal democracy. 
Indeed, right-wing populists in Poland and left-wing populists in Slovakia are now allied in government with extreme nationalist parties. 
In Hungary, the main opposition party Fidesz organizes demonstrations in front of Parliament for the resignation of a government, even after it won a confidence vote. 
In the Czech Republic, a minority right-wing government has not gained a confidence vote in Parliament after six months of bickering. 
Political instability and unpredictable behavior by elected leaders typifies affairs throughout the region. 
Even more worrying is the erosion of trust in democratic institutions. 
According to a recent Gallup International poll, Central and East Europeans are the most skeptical about democracy, which only about one-third of people trust. 
In contrast to a majority of West Europeans, East Europeans do not consider their elections free and fair. 
Only 22% responded affirmatively when asked, “Do you think your voice matters?” Democracy today has no rivals, but it is losing support. 
Populist movements harvest that ambivalence and discontent. 
They are not anti-democratic; indeed, they claim to be the “true voice of the people,” and constantly demand new elections or referenda. 
But they are anti-liberal; they accept democracy’s demand for the popular legitimacy, but reject its demand for constitutionalism (the separation of powers). 
They do not believe that constitutional norms and representative democracy have primacy over values and “legitimate” popular grievances. 
In Slovakia, the anti-liberal reaction applies also to the treatment of national minorities. 
After 15 years of free-market policies, populists in Warsaw, Bratislava, and Budapest want to bring back the state. 
Their vision is a “Christian Europe” of “sovereign nation-states” that opposes the existing materialist, decadent, permissive, and supra-national model. 
The EU can probably learn to live with these populists, because it has to. 
Indeed, populism moves in cycles. 
Many argue that the pro-EU consensus of the last decade emptied politics of its substance, contributing to the current populist backlash. 
But the EU can also constrain populism. 
After all, populist nationalists have joined (and since left) government coalitions in Austria, Italy, Holland, and Denmark. 
And, while nationalist populism is a trans-European phenomenon, populism today, unlike in the 1930’s, it does not hold itself out as an alternative to democracy. 
The Return of Religion? 
BUDAPEST – It’s a well-worn contrast: the United States is religious, Europe is secular. 
Consider French President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
On numerous occasions, he has argued that his country needs to rethink its traditional strict separation of state and religion, called laïcité . 
In particular, according to the twice-divorced self-confessed “cultural Catholic,” France should develop a “positive secularism.” 
Now he wants state subsidies for faith-based organizations – a policy proposal that upsets his many secularist critics. 
The Spanish People’s Party tried hard to mobilize Catholics during the election campaign in March 2008. 
This reminded many observers of what the America’s Republican Party tried to do in order to demonstrate its “pro-life commitments” during George W. Bush’s presidency. 
In short, there is a pattern here. 
But the point is not that individuals in different European countries are becoming more religious – there is hardly any evidence for that. 
Globally, there might be good reasons to talk about what sociologists describe as the rise of “post-secular societies,” but Europe remains the exception. 
Many of these parties used to advocate market radicalism, or at least strong doses of economic liberalization. 
Not just since the financial crisis have they retreated from these positions and tried to fashion a gentler, more socially conscious image. 
In fact, some intellectuals close to the right have long advocated an opening towards Europe’s Muslim immigrants and their descendants. 
This is not to say that all appeals to religion are just cynical election ploys. 
Especially in the face of the financial crisis, religion has been presented as a source for what Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have called the project of “moralizing capitalism.” 
That is not an absurd idea. 
There is a long and distinguished tradition of Catholic social thought. 
Theories of “red Toryism” might go some way in this direction, but it remains to be seen whether they will ever translate into practice. 
The Return of the King in Nepal 
Every time we in Nepal think things can’t get worse, they do. 
The next year, parliament was dissolved and local elected bodies were disbanded. 
Last week, King Gyanendra sacked his prime minister again, declared a state of emergency, and suspended civil liberties. 
Nepal’s 15-year experiment with democracy now seems over. 
Since February 1, the Nepali media have been subjected to absolute censorship. 
Nothing that goes against the “letter and spirit” of the king’s dismissal of his government is allowed to be printed and broadcast, and “action will be taken against anyone violating the notice.” 
Armed soldiers now sit in newsrooms, vetting the galleys before they go off to press. 
Sometimes, they change headlines that they think are critical of the royal move. 
Nepal’s vibrant FM radio stations – once models for decentralized public-service broadcasting and community radio – have been prohibited from broadcasting current affairs. 
Some FM stations have been locked down and are silent. 
The BBC’s Nepalese service, which used to be relayed through a network of 12 FM stations all over the country, has been stopped. 
All Indian news channels have been dropped from cable networks. 
On Saturday, two senior journalists were detained for issuing statements critical of the crackdowns. 
Newspapers and magazines are blandly reproducing official pronouncements and reports from the state-run news agency. 
At least one newspaper came out with its news pages completely blank. 
Most young journalists, especially those in radio, have been shocked by the censorship. 
The freedoms that they were so accustomed to, and maybe even took for granted, have now been snatched away. 
Back then, irrational news decisions, sycophancy, and propaganda were passed off as journalism. 
In those days, editors, reporters, and columnists played a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities, resorting to satire, humor, or metaphor. 
But punishment could be harsh. 
At the police station, he asked the protestor, “Why are you denouncing dictatorship in Pakistan when it exists here?” 
To be sure, many Nepalis have welcomed King Gyanendra’s move this week. 
If this is what the king had to do to restore peace, they say, so be it. 
After all, the king has staked all and gambled his own throne by taking over power. 
They have a point. 
The king has a window of opportunity to deliver on his promises. 
Perhaps King Gyanendra does have something up his sleeves. 
In the long run, however, the answer to Maoist totalitarianism is greater and more inclusive democracy, a vibrant free press, and civil liberties. 
Curtailing freedom merely polarizes society. 
Indeed, even as a short-term strategy against the Maoists, it may well prove counterproductive. 
The Return of the Radicals in Iran 
By looking at earlier revolutions, we can perhaps come to understand what is happening in Iran, for recent events there have clear historical precedents. 
Many revolutions have passed through an initial “quiet” period after an early phase of radicalism, only to experience a resurgence of radicalism 15-25 years later. 
The Mexican Revolution of 1910 began with a challenge to the dictator Porfirio Díaz that ignited peasant uprisings and worker revolts. 
For the next 14 years, Obregón and his ally General Plutarco Calles ruled Mexico. 
Known for both his radicalism and his honesty, Cárdenas refused to live in the presidential palace and cut his salary in half. 
He also took seriously the early goals of the revolution, embarking on massive land reforms. 
Only in the 1940’s, after Cárdenas left power, did Mexico turn to a more conservative political path. 
These “Red Guards” launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966-68, targeting the more conservative elements within the Communist Party. 
The Cultural Revolution tore China apart, but it returned Mao to supreme power and allowed him to purge the pragmatists. 
But did the battle between pragmatists and radicals end there? 
Deng was rehabilitated the following year, and in the late 1970’s, after Mao’s death, Deng’s pragmatists seized control of the regime. 
What do these historical examples suggest for Iran? 
It is likely that the relatively calm period dating from Khomeini’s death in 1989 is over. 
The election of Ahmadinejad marks the onset of new struggles within the ruling Islamic Republican Party. 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is left in the middle, perhaps increasingly isolated and without strong popular support. 
How should the US and European leaders respond? 
Historically, phases of resurgent radicalism have lasted 5-10 years, marked by greater aggressiveness against internal and external enemies. 
(China developed its nuclear weapons just before its Cultural Revolution, mainly to deter the Soviet Union, but never used them). 
Neither country always sees eye to eye with the West. 
But both became countries with which it is possible to do a great deal of business, and both are increasingly integrated into the global economy. 
That may be the only realistic goal in dealing with Iran. 
The Return of the Siloviki 
Instead, they would seek to enter the world trade body as a single customs union. 
In effect, this means that Russia seems to be casting aside its accession to the WTO – a major reversal of Russian strategy. 
Putin’s statement hit like a bolt from the blue. 
As late as June 3, Putin had declared himself sure of Russia’s “swift joining of the WTO.” 
After 16 years of negotiations, Russia appeared poised to join the WTO within a couple of months. 
Indeed, only three difficult hurdles remained. 
First, Ukraine demands a bilateral protocol on market access, which would force Russia to abolish roughly 100 trade sanctions, primarily in agriculture. 
Finally, the EU insists that Russia abolish planned prohibitive export tariffs on lumber. 
Only the Georgian issue is really serious. 
A customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is no alternative to Russia’s WTO accession. 
No countries have ever entered the WTO collectively, nor is this legally possible says WTO head Pascal Lamy. 
Moreover, while the customs union was proclaimed in 1995, the earliest it can be formed is in July 2011, which is unlikely. 
Predominantly a commodity exporter, Russia has less need for the WTO than a manufacturer like China. 
Even so, one-fifth of Russia’s exports comprise metals and chemicals that are sensitive to anti-dumping measures. 
Membership is also important for Russia’s international standing. 
It is the only G-20 country outside of the WTO, which accounts for 96% of global trade. 
The WTO also represents a choice of economic and political strategy. 
In their rhetoric, President Dmitri Medvedev and his technocrats embrace this vision. 
This strategy amounts to state capitalism, living on Russia’s energy wealth, and doing nothing to curtail Russia’s massive red tape and corruption. 
By reversing course on the WTO, Putin has again shown himself to be Russia’s master. 
He did the same thing last summer by lashing out against a successful mining and metallurgical company, Mechel, and provoking the war in Georgia. 
During the winter, Putin’s poor policy choices on the financial crisis undermined his power. 
The question is what their next step will be. 
Georgia has received no military support and is virtually undefended. 
The Kremlin continues its propaganda offensive against Georgia, and has vetoed prolonging the mandate for United Nations observers in Georgia and Abkhazia. 
A major Russian military maneuver, Caucasus 2009, is underway. 
The last such maneuver, Caucasus 2008, was followed by the invasion of Georgia. 
During the latter part of this maneuver, July 6-8, US President Barack Obama is supposed to meet President Medvedev in Moscow. 
Medvedev obviously hopes to reach out and improve Russia’s and his own standing in the world. 
The siloviki , however, prefer Russia isolated and authoritarian, with power securely in their hands. 
The Kremlin wants a new strategic arms control agreement, but the siloviki desire nothing more. 
Obama’s administration had hoped for a final breakthrough in Russia’s WTO talks, but Putin’s actions have eliminated prospects for such an outcome. 
The US also wants progress on the territorial integrity of former Soviet states, such as Georgia, but that, too, is unlikely. 
Yet there is still hope that Putin encounters a sufficiently negative reaction that he changes his stance on WTO accession. 
After all, he suspended Russia’s WTO accession talks after the August 2008 war in Georgia, only to allow them to restart this spring. 
The Return of Tuberculosis 
Generations of doctors, politicians, and public health officials have struggled to defeat tuberculosis. 
But, after years of success, TB is making a comeback. 
The increase in TB in the developed world since 1992 was initially attributed to HIV. 
However, over time, other factors behind the growing number of cases, such as immigration and a particular type of drug-resistant TB, have emerged. 
The World Health Organization has developed a strategy to fight TB’s return, including a standardized therapy that specifies appropriate drugs, doses, and timing of therapy. 
Moreover, any inadequately treated TB becomes multi-drug resistant, so that treatment failure can be either cause or consequence of MDR-TB. 
We conducted a systematic review of published reports to identify the factors that cause unsuccessful TB treatment in Europe. 
Patients were treated “unsuccessfully” 12.3% of the time, and 6.8% of treated patients died. 
MDR-TB was inversely associated with successful treatments. 
We found that populations with at least 10% MDR-TB showed a notable reduction in successful outcomes. 
These results suggest the following clinical and public health implications: 
· since successful TB treatment outcomes are below the 85% threshold, an enhancement of national TB control programs is needed in most European countries; 
· MDR is the most important obstacle to controlling TB in Europe; 
· treatment characteristics need to be reported more consistently in order to identify and correct the factors related to inadequate treatment of TB in Europe. 
Structural barriers do not represent the only problems of access to treatment in the health care system. 
Foreign-born patients may interrupt treatment due to lack of confidence in diagnosis and care, or they may ignore the more minor symptoms of the illness. 
Patients who feel better after the initial treatment may also fail to complete therapy. 
Social factors other than birthplace should be studied to evaluate what causes primary multi-drug resistance. 
Treatment interruption has been associated with asylum seekers and refugees in Switzerland. 
Interruption was also associated with homelessness, intravenous drug use, and alcohol dependence in Hamburg. 
In Spain, homelessness was a risk factor for interruption and HIV positivity, and intravenous drug use was a risk factor for unsuccessful treatment. 
I also believe that there is a relationship between the need for therapy and the political choices that countries make. 
The DOTS strategy is not implemented in all European countries, owing in part to disagreement about whether treatment is a duty or a right. 
The End of the Emerging-Market Party 
Emerging-market stocks and bonds are down for the year and their economic growth is slowing. 
To see why, it is useful to understand how we got here. 
And it was not just these so-called BRIC countries that boomed. 
This means that average sales, measured in US dollars, by supermarkets, beverage companies, department stores, telecoms, computer shops, and Chinese motorcycle vendors grew at comparable rates in these countries. 
One might be inclined to interpret this amazing emerging-market performance as a consequence of the growth in the amount of real stuff that these economies produced. 
But that would be mostly wrong. 
Consider Brazil. 
Only 11% of its China-beating nominal GDP growth between 2003 and 2011 was due to growth in real (inflation-adjusted) output. 
Some of the prices that increased were those of commodities that Brazil exports. 
Russia went through a somewhat similar experience. 
The share of real growth in the main emerging countries’ nominal US dollar GDP growth was 20%. 
Countries that grow faster tend to experience real exchange-rate appreciation, a phenomenon known as the Balassa-Samuelson effect. 
Real exchange rates may also appreciate because of increases in capital inflows, which reflect foreign investors’ enthusiasm for the prospects of the country in question. 
Distinguishing between these disparate and inter-related phenomena is important, because some are clearly unsustainable. 
In general, terms-of-trade improvements and capital inflows do not continue permanently: they either stabilize or eventually reverse direction. 
Indeed, terms of trade do not have much of a long-term trend and show very pronounced reversion to the mean. 
The debate is whether prices will remain more or less where they are or decline, as food, metals, and coal prices have already done. 
The same can be said of capital inflows and the upward pressure that they place on the real exchange rate. 
In some countries, such as China, Thailand, South Korea, and Vietnam, nominal GDP growth was driven to a large extent by real growth. 
Moreover, according to the soon-to-be-published Atlas of Economic Complexity, these economies began producing more complex products, a harbinger of sustainable growth. 
These mean-reverting processes are, well, reverting, implying that the buoyant performance of the recent past is unlikely to return any time soon. 
The Revolt of China’s Twittering Classes 
BEIJING – Last week, Liu Xiaobo was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China. 
Yet few voices in mainland Chinese media are discussing Liu’s Nobel Prize. 
The government’s propaganda department has ordered major media to keep the news from spreading to the general public by imposing strict censorship. 
In fact, on CCTV’s widely viewed 7 p.m. national newscast, not a word on Liu was mentioned on the day he received the prize. 
Despite this news blackout, China’s blogosphere and microblogs exploded after Liu was announced as the winner. 
For example, on Sina’s microblog site, bloggers used pictures, euphemisms, and English or traditional Chinese characters to avoid censorship. 
Twitter-style microblogging is extremely popular in China. 
Soon afterwards, its most famous Chinese clone, Fanfou.com, also was closed down, leaving one million registered users homeless. 
Indeed, Twitter is the only place where people can talk freely about Liu‘s Nobel prize. 
A search of the hash tag “#Liuxiaobo” shows that relevant messages pop up hundreds of times per minute. 
But the social revolution brought by microblogging might be even more important than the communication revolution. 
Does Web 2.0 technology imply an analogous role for “Twivolution” in a Chinese democratic transition one day? 
Instead, these information-sharing tools and channels promote more subtle social progress. 
That subtlety reflects the distinction between macro-politics and micro-politics. 
Macro-politics is structural, whereas micro-politics is daily. 
Changes in the micro-political system do not necessarily lead to an adjustment in the macro structure, particularly in hyper-controlled political systems like China’s. 
Why is micro-power so important? 
In the past, only a few highly motivated people engaged in political activism; the masses took almost no initiative. 
Passionate people did not understand why the public seemed unconcerned about their efforts. 
Today, highly motivated people can lower the threshold for action so that people with less passion join their efforts. 
Currently, the Chinese Twittersphere has three prominent features: First, as China’s rulers strengthen their censorship efforts, Twitter has become highly politicized. 
Its influence on Chinese cyberspace and traditional media is the result of this grouping. 
Finally, Twitter can be used as a mobilizing tool in China. 
With the proliferation of Twitter clones in China (all the major portals now offer microblog services), social movements in China are getting a long-term boost. 
So Twitter has become a major tool to promote contentious politics in China. 
It can effectively link discourse and action, generate widespread campaigns, and forge common ground among rights activists, public intellectuals, and all kinds of Twitter users. 
The Revolt of the Debtors 
It may also determine the future of the euro. 
As long as the Greek people have to be asked to accept one austerity package after another, they might wonder when they will have a direct say on this matter. 
Simply put, pan-eurozone financial governance had supposedly won the day. 
Despite that, it was taken without any coordination with other eurozone leaders. 
Greece would have sunk or swum on its own. 
The EU remains a collection of sovereign states, and it therefore cannot send an army or a police force to enforce its pacts or collect debt. 
Any country can leave the EU – and, of course, the eurozone – when the burden of its obligations becomes too onerous. 
Until now, it had been assumed that the cost of exit would be so high that no country would consider it. 
This no longer seems to be the case – or so the Greeks, at least, seemed to believe. 
This also implies that Eurobonds will never constitute the silver bullet that some had hoped would solve Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. 
The broader message of the Greek move is that “coordination” has so far been a code word for almost total control by creditors (sometimes together with the ECB). 
The attempt to impose a benevolent creditors’ dictatorship is now being met by a debtors’ revolt. 
Nobody can know at this point whether Portugal or Italy might be the next stops on this road of resistance. 
The result, however, is quite predictable: soaring risk premia throughout the periphery. 
Papandreou’s decision to call a referendum in Greece could thus have marked the beginning of the endgame for the euro. 
The Revolt of the Meritocrats 
Before the crisis hit, however, redistribution of wealth (and the tax and social security payments that make it possible) was considered the biggest obstacle to economic efficiency. 
Indeed, the values of solidarity had given way to those of individual “merit,” judged by the size of one’s paycheck. 
With this isolation and autonomy, people increasingly tend to believe, for better or for worse, that they alone are responsible for their own fate. 
Here lies the conundrum. 
When merit is measured by money, there is no ethical limit to the size of an individual’s paycheck. 
If I earn ten, a hundred, or a thousand times more than you, it is because I deserve ten, a hundred, or a thousand times more than you. 
Merit and skills are how we give an intrinsic value to money. 
Human nature – ego and/or arrogance – does the rest. 
It is no surprise, then, that many people think of themselves as priceless. 
The central place where this self-(over)evaluation meets the fewest obstacles is the financial market. 
Of course, when the crisis hit, financial institutions were the first to argue that autonomy was unrealistic, and that we are all interdependent. 
After all, why else should taxpayers agree to rescue them? 
But now these same institutions are deciding that they want to go their own way again. 
So yesterday’s (pre-crisis) world is being resurrected. 
No one should be surprised about this. 
The economic stakes encourage everyone to make the best of their circumstances. 
The bailout of banks led to a wave of mergers. 
If they were already too big to fail, what should we now say when banks are even bigger? 
Their market power has increased, yet they know they incur no risk, owing to the aggravated systemic impact of their potential bankruptcy. 
Working in so uncompetitive a market is a real stroke of luck. 
I do not know many businessmen who would not take advantage of this; to be honest, I do not know any. 
I also participate indirectly and abstractly in forging the common good, by creating value through my work, and I am rewarded for it. 
But suddenly the system collapses, the creation of value turns into destruction and parallel universes collide. 
For the connections between the economy and the world of finance are so strong and the interdependency between the so-called parallel universes so tight that there was no choice. 
Eyes are opened; the illusion of arbitrage between efficiency and solidarity fades. 
Two conclusions can be drawn from all this. 
The first is that we all owe at least some of our success to others, given the public goods that society provides. 
This calls for more modesty and restraint in determining the highest salaries, not for moral reasons but for the sustainability of the system. 
But don’t hold your breath waiting for them to agree. 
The Revolt of the Mullahs 
Whether ordinary Iranians now believe that the reformers are also beyond redemption is an open question. 
Iranian reformers had tried (to no avail) since the landslide 1997 election of President Mohammed Khatami, to change the system from within. 
Iranians were initially hopeful, but after years of waiting in vain they grew impatient. 
Now they are despondent. 
Reformists were justly criticized for lacking unity and resolve, but in truth their greatest impediment was a lack of constitutional authority. 
They have no intention of parting with it. 
The Guardian Council's barring of over 2,000 mostly reformist candidates from participating in the parliamentary elections was the last straw. 
Reformist parties boycotted the vote. 
Despite a frenzied public relations campaign by regime officials, only half of all eligible voters participated. 
In Tehran, the country's political heart and soul, less than a third of the electorate turned out. 
Foreign journalists declared it the biggest legitimacy crisis in the 25-year history of the Islamic Republic, but Iranians seemed surprised by the commotion. 
Egregious abuse of power by conservative hardliners is not newsworthy to them. 
They held no illusions that their country was a democracy. 
Iran's near-term political future remains unclear. 
How reformists regroup, and how the youthful Iranian populace reacts, depends largely on the path the conservatives take. 
Similar to reformists, who encompass a broad range of political ideals, Iranian conservatives are a mixed bag. Many are reactionary religious fundamentalists who abhor the concept of democracy. 
Whether conservative ideologues or pragmatists dominate the new parliament - which takes office in June - remains to be seen. 
Either way, the conservatives must weigh their strategy carefully. 
Some of these now call for passive resistance and civil disobedience. 
It will be the task of Ayatollah Khamenei to rein in conservative ideologues and make sure that pragmatic conservatism prevails. 
That Khamenei is himself more of an ideologue makes that task doubly difficult for him. 
Although he is capable of providing people with increased political and social freedoms, he is simply unwilling. 
Above all, the conservatives' fate - and the fate of the regime as a whole - depends on the country's punishing economy. 
Despite Iran's vast oil wealth, close to a third of the population lives in poverty. 
Inflation and unemployment remain rampant. 
Demographics exacerbate these conditions. 
For the majority of Iranians, economic improvement is the priority. 
Conservatives, no less than reformers, must come to terms with this reality. 
No matter how hard they try, there exists no simple or immediate solution to Iran's endemic economic corruption and mismanagement. 
As a result, Iran's near-term political prospects appear ominous. 
But reasons to be hopeful about the long-term political future do exist. 
Monarchic and theocratic systems have both failed. 
Backers of a socialist model have gone the way of the Soviet Union. 
Liberal democracy is essentially the last man standing in Iran. 
The road from authoritarianism to democracy will not be smooth or short. 
Agitators for reform will continue to push. 
Regime loyalists will continue to push back. 
So the long term could be long in coming. 
The Revolt Of The States 
BUENOS AIRES: Ceaseless change seems to be at the heart of today’s global civilization. 
To them, change appears as something irrational, even as a catastrophe. 
People increasingly see change not as something that enhances their freedom and dignity but as a force encouraging avarice and unfairness. 
By concentrating wealth narrowly, globalization produces more threats than opportunities. 
Seeing this, many people fear a new dominant class intolerably manipulating globalization for its betterment. 
Only with independence does the confidence for greater participation come, and greater participation means improved governance, both in the international order and domestically. 
For free individuals – free citizens, free states – are the real protagonists of governance. 
Without full and equal responsibility there can be no lasting governance. 
This is what market fundamentalists, management consultants, and technocrats fail to understand. 
People in the United States and Western Europe recognize how continuity in their democratic systems enhanced their prosperity. 
By contrast, we in Latin America and Eastern Europe know that democracy has trouble surviving in times of crisis, poverty, and isolation. 
In individual states protection of the weak is attained by equal application of the rule of law. 
This must also be made true in international relations. 
Only the cooperation of free and equal nations can bring this about. 
Only such equal cooperation can secure the solid political basis for integration. 
So long as a country is subordinated to the uncontrollable force of globalization, its future is in foreign hands. 
Everyone acknowledges that the market requires rules in order to avoid deformations such as monopolies and oligopolies. 
But monopolies of wealth are just as pernicious. 
The State should not abandon its redistributive role; neither can the State surrender to the market its role in development. 
For any program based on selfishness and injustice must generate strong forces of social dissolution and instability. 
The great challenge is to increase equality, and for this the State, which globalization claims to have overthrown, is vital. 
It is the State’s undeniable obligation to guarantee the benefits of social security to all the inhabitants of a country. 
Marxists used to agitate that the workers of the world unite. 
The logic of power in that future world will be unforgiving toward those who give up on their will to self-determination. 
To maintain that will, we must fight the fear of going against the prevailing political orthodoxy of an inevitable globalization. 
The only fish that always swims with the current is a dead fish. 
The Revolution Betrayed 
KYIV – From snowy Kyiv, I have watched the successful revolutions in Cairo and Tunis with joy and admiration. 
Egyptians and Tunisians are right to be proud of their desire to peacefully overthrow despotic governments. 
The first of Ukraine’s lessons for Egyptian and Tunisian democrats is that elections do not a democracy make. 
After all, what if the enemies of freedom use elections to entrench their anti-democratic agendas? 
In Ukraine today, these are not abstract questions. 
Of course, Ukraine’s plight does not mean that the people of Egypt and Tunisia should spurn the call for free elections. 
Determining the will of the people does require expression through the ballot box. 
But elections alone cannot solve the fundamental political problems confronting Egypt and Tunisia. 
In particular, they cannot create a liberal order and open society. 
Democratic consent can truly be given only when voters know what they are consenting to. 
Moreover, democracy must be rooted in the rule of law. 
There must be accepted rules that are binding on everyone in politics, so that whoever does not accept or obey them is disqualified. 
Yet he was not. 
Stealing elections, suppressing the vote, and behaving in contempt of the rule of law are negations of democracy. 
Those who engage in them must be seen as democracy’s enemies and treated as such. 
A second lesson follows from this. 
The fact that a government has been democratically elected does not mean that the cause of freedom has prevailed. 
The rest of the world must not turn a blind eye to authoritarian backsliding. 
For decades, Egyptians and Tunisians paid a high a price in freedom for the stability of others. 
They must never be asked, or forced, to pay it again. 
One way to help prevent a democratic revolution from being betrayed from within is by building a genuine civil society. 
We in Ukraine learned this truth from harsh experience in the communist era. 
Although communism could, every now and then, coexist with private property, and sometimes with private enterprise, it could never coexist with civil society. 
The most fateful attack to accompany the installation of any dictatorship is an attack on civil society. 
In Ukraine, freedom of speech was, on communism’s fall, restored overnight. 
Its pillars – private, voluntary associations, decentralization of the state, and delegation of political power to independent bodies – must be nurtured patiently and from below. 
Where civil society remains underdeveloped, every problem filters up to the “Big Man” squatting at the top. 
Let us celebrate the arrival in North Africa of the spirit of liberty and of solidarity, which brought Ukraine its liberty once and will do so again. 
And let us pledge that our solidarity does not end at the borders of our nations. 
Freedom – true freedom – is indivisible. 
The Revolution Reborn 
Although the Sandinista Front in Nicaragua did win a semi-legitimate election in 1984, it had reached power five years earlier by overthrowing the Somoza dictatorship. 
By 2006, when Daniel Ortega was finally re-elected, the old Sandinista Front of 1979 was unrecognizable. 
El Salvador’s Farabundo Martí Liberation Front (FMLN) was created in 1980, through the fusion of five guerrilla groups supported by Cuba and Nicaragua. 
According to ARENA’s relentlessly negative campaign, a triumph for the left would bring communism, Hugo Chávez, and the Castro brothers to San Salvador. 
But scare tactics did not work this time. 
There is obviously a lesson here to be learned by other left-wing political movements and guerrilla groups in Latin America. 
For, while Funes is no old guerrilla hack, his vice president, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, and almost the entire FMLN leadership are unreformed Castroist guerrilla leaders and cadres. 
It is they, not Funes, who control the FMLN organization. 
A second worrying factor is the FMLN’s links to Cuba and Venezuela. 
But Cuba’s influence on the old FMLN leadership remains intact. 
Cuban and Venezuelan involvement in political parties in Mexico or Brazil, for example, is undisputable, but not necessarily very relevant. 
These are large countries with huge economies, where conspiring and doling out small perks and favors is not very effective. 
But El Salvador, like Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Ecuador, is another story. 
We will know soon. 
But the most important consequence of the FMLN’s victory may lie in its effect on the rest of Central America and Mexico. 
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, more out of convenience and demagogy than conviction, has moved into the Chávez orbit; 
Nicaragua’s Ortega was always part of that orbit, as are people close to Alvaro Colóm in Guatemala. 
Of course, the Central American nations do not wield huge influence in Mexico; if anything, it is the other way around. 
But the Mexican left, while no longer as weak as it was after its defeat in 2006, has always needed foreign role models. 
To dismiss the FMLN’s historical achievement as simply an act of justice or a foreseeable event in a tiny backwater would be reckless. 
The Revolution Will Not Be Memorialized 
Forty years ago Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution. 
But. for the Chinese, the Cultural Revolution was itself a betrayal, one that continues to this day. 
The Cultural Revolution marked the climax of class extermination practiced by the Party during the 1960’s. 
The survivors of all the previous political movements, now enthralled by Mao’s personality cult, were free of all constraint, able to kill and seek revenge with impunity. 
Good people get to know each other by biting each other and it serves bad people right if they are bitten by good ones…” 
These are people who, like the Hitler Youth, turned over their bloody page of history and never looked back. 
Another 100,000 were driven from their homes. 
Those who had been born “landlords, rich farmers, reactionaries, bad elements, and rightists” were among the first to be victimized. 
Desperate to save their lives, families voluntarily smashed their properties and pulped their ancient paintings and calligraphy. 
Soon, ancient sites would be ruined. 
People killed others to safeguard Mao, and those who were executed shouted “Long Live Chairman Mao” on their way to death. 
In Guangxi province, where some of the worst violence occurred, nearly 100,000 people were killed during July and August 1968. 
In the official “Memorabilia of the Cultural Revolution in Guangxi,” many infants appear on the death list. 
Livers, eyes, or brains were removed while victims were still alive. 
Mao set off yet another wave of persecutions in 1968. 
In countless “suicides,” many people were simply bitten to death, or took their own lives when the suffering became too much to bear. 
In Beijing, deaths occurred mostly in areas wuth trees and lakes. 
Wang Youqin reports that on November 4, four bodies were found floating in the lake of the Summer Palace. 
A total of 63 people were killed at the prestigious Beijing University. 
Mao died aspiring to exterminate Chinese culture. 
His Cultural Revolution alone killed as many as two million people, shattered traditions, uprooted spiritual and ethical values, and tore apart family ties and communal loyalties. 
People who experienced it seal off the memory, for the pain, worse than a bullet to the heart, overwhelms souls. 
Worst of all, Mao’s crimes against civilization, unlike those of, say, Hitler, are ongoing. 
The Communist Party still uses his brainwashing methods, and his legacy continues to be officially revered. 
The Chinese people, unsurprisingly, regard politics with a mixture of caution and dread. 
Last month, I watched a TV show featuring Han Meilin, a famous painter. 
In his closing remarks, he announced his words of wisdom to viewers: “Long live those who don’t care!” 
Han Meilin was badly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. 
His declaration was greeted by a roar of applause from the studio audience. 
The Revolutionary Conservative Pope 
Twenty-five years ago, Poland's people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow, as Pope. 
Some were frightened, others wept with joy. 
Here, said a prominent writer, was "Poland's second baptism." 
But even in our euphoria, we did not expect how much the new Pope would change not only Poland, but the world. 
His first return visit to his native country soon afterwards showed to all the world the new Pope's power. 
Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw, yet the streets became models of order. 
After decades of disempowerment, Poles suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination. 
Some see in the Pope the person responsible for a religious revival; others see a man of peace. 
Some see a defender of the poor, others a critic of liberation theology. 
Indeed, the central feature of the first decade of the Pope's reign was his struggle against dictatorship--Communist dictatorship in particular. 
John Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon potent enough to undo Yalta's division of the world. 
Perhaps in part because of their strong anticommunist stance, the Polish Church and John Paul II are often branded as "conservative." 
The accusation is meant to suggest that the Church cannot live comfortably with a pluralist democracy. 
To be sure, in the struggle against Communism, the Polish Church was, indeed, conservative--and thank God for that! 
It was conservative in its absolute fidelity to evangelical values, to the truth of faith, to its historical identity. 
For the system of official atheism and legalized mendacity, the Church was a living rebuke. 
What is the Pope's message for the postcommunist world he helped create? 
John Paul II undoubtedly keeps a distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal state, which he often charges with permissiveness and moral relativism. 
A critique of individualism in the name of collective values occurs frequently in the Pope's pronouncements. 
He sees the failings of liberalism as particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries. 
The market economy, despite its practical achievements, seems to him oftentimes to lack a heart and a human face. 
He sees the market as favoring entrepreneurship over human solidarity. 
I confess that I view the heritage of Communism with more skepticism. 
This is why postcommunist societies do not demonstrate any nobility or disinterestedness that seriously contrasts with the West. 
Communism's defeat left a huge black hole in communities' souls, which is now being filled with nationalism, bigotry, and Western consumerism. 
He is a conservative who loves freedom and a "peacemonger" who condemns injustice, but who reminds us that mercy is more important than justice. 
In this, he personifies the paradox that is Christianity: unbreakable and lasting principles joined by understanding and tolerance. 
Twenty-five years after John Paul II left Poland for Rome, we Poles remain grateful to him for having helped us regain our freedom. 
It is good that John Paul II is among us. 
A world where everything changes needs a guardian of what remains the same. 
The Revolutionary Ethics of Embryo Research 
What appeared to be the most momentous scientific advance of 2005 is currently under siege. 
Although the scientific validity of their research is now the subject of several separate investigations, it is no less important to examine its ethical implications. 
But then Hwang’s collaborators began questioning the validity of the experiment itself, and Hwang notified Science that he wished to withdraw the paper. 
He has reportedly even suggested that some cells may have been tampered with. 
We will not know how close we are to the production of individually tailored stem-cell lines until the scientific investigations into Hwang’s research are completed. 
Nevertheless, few researchers doubt that what Hwang and his colleagues claimed to do is, in principle, achievable. 
If Hwang was not the first to do it, someone else eventually will. 
Once it can be done reliably, it will pave the way for important medical breakthroughs. 
But the ethical significance of such research goes far beyond the undoubted importance of saving critically ill patients. 
But it is precisely this reasoning that is threatened by what Hwang and his team claimed to have achieved. 
This possibility highlights the weakness of the argument that abortion, too, is wrong because it destroys a genetically unique human being. 
But it seems absurd that this should make any difference to the morality of aborting the fetus. 
Each fetus – the one she aborts and the one she later conceives through sexual intercourse – has its own “unique” DNA. 
In the absence of special reasons, like a change in sexual partners, there seems to be no reason to prefer the existence of one child to that of the other. 
Perhaps the assumption is that, as opponents of abortion sometimes say, the aborted fetus had the genetic potential to become a Beethoven or an Einstein. 
So why prefer one genetic potential over the other? 
If so, then this is all the more true of embryos. 
The Rich Should Keep Their Word 
For the first time in human history, the world is within striking distance of ending global poverty. 
A preposterous claim? 
Perhaps. 
Yet, I'll stick to my claim. 
I am speaking of the gut-wrenching, life-threatening poverty of living on less than $1 per day. 
For the first time ever, the world has it in its power to eliminate those extreme conditions. 
Why is this? 
The world's richest countries have continued their economic ascent for generations, carried forward by the flowering of science and technology. 
Even though poor countries seem to be falling ever farther behind, the truth is more heartening. 
Large parts of the so-called developing world, especially in Asia, have made incredible strides away from absolute poverty. 
India achieved notable successes more recently, though much remains to be accomplished. 
The poorest of the poor in sub-Saharan Africa and in remote areas of Latin America and Central Asia have not shared these successes. 
At least 1 billion people, perhaps nearly twice that number, live in squalid conditions of hunger, disease, and impoverishment. 
In many of these countries, the past twenty years have marked a time of regress, not progress. 
Disease has swept Africa, with the AIDS pandemic and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis. 
That aid, combined with the market-based economic growth, could end extreme poverty. 
Importantly, rich countries are committed to working with the poorest countries to meet these objectives. 
But as with many promises, America and other donor countries have so far failed to live up to their pledges. 
At the UN's Millennium Summit in September 2000, the world's leaders made solemn pledges to tackle global poverty. 
They issued a declaration calling for action now, so that extreme poverty can be dramatically reduced by the year 2015. 
They even pledged to mobilize financial assistance. 
For example, rich and poor countries together have committed to reducing infant mortality rates by two-thirds as of 2015, compared with the levels in countries as of 1990. 
Sadly, for dozens of countries around the world, that target is not being met, because too little money is invested in health. 
The rich world can redeem itself, indeed promote its interests in global peace and prosperity, by proving that the Millennium Development Goals are not empty words. 
The key test of those commitments will come next month at a UN Conference in Monterrey, Mexico on Finance for Development. 
The conference will focus on the bottom line - where is the money to fight poverty and disease? 
Will the rich follow promises with actions? 
Let's hope, for our common future, that the world's leaders get it right this time around. 
The Richest Get Richer 
Card-carrying neo-liberals like me, who pushed for opening capital flows wide in the early 1990's, had a particular vision in mind. 
But the future that we hoped for did not come to pass. 
"Why not free up capital flows and so encourage large-scale lending from the rich to the poor?" we asked. 
But things didn't turn out that way this time around. 
What has fed these inflows? 
America's economy became - and remains - a giant vacuum cleaner, soaking up the world's spare investment cash. 
So those of us who still wish to be flag-waving advocates for international capital mobility are reduced to two arguments. 
First, and most important, capital controls create ideal conditions for large-scale corruption. 
With capital controls, people who badly want to move their capital across borders can't - unless they find some complaisant bureaucrat. 
But an effective market economy needs to minimize the incentives and opportunities for corruption, or it will turn into something worse. 
Second, perhaps the inflow of capital into America was and remains justified: perhaps there is something uniquely valuable about investments in America today. 
The first era was not an unqualified success. 
Looking at the capital flow reversal into the US, I cannot argue that the second era has been an unqualified success either. 
But the flip side of the trade surplus is the capital outflow. 
Should capital-poor Mexico really be financing a further jump in the capital intensity of the US economy? 
It is not possible for a card-carrying neo-liberal like me to wish for anything but the most minor of controls to curb speculative of capital flows. 
But the hope for a repetition of the late 19th-century experience has - so far - proved vain. 
The Right Populism for Poland 
But the demise of the left does not mean that the right has a coherent economic program. 
What Poland needs most is fiscal discipline and market-oriented reforms, including relaxation of the rigid labor laws that are inhibiting job creation. 
But can the political will for renewed reform be mustered in a government that is half liberal and half populist? 
Moreover, a commitment to pursue euro membership will have positive spillover effects. 
It will reinforce convergence expectations among financial market participants, which will translate into lower risk premia for investors. 
More stable financial markets and a less volatile exchange rate relative to the euro will bring many advantages. 
Most importantly, lower exchange-rate risk will boost both domestic and foreign direct investment, thereby helping to alleviate unemployment. 
By developing and disclose to the public a compelling rationale for what will determine the exchange rate when the time comes, the financial markets would then be able to forecast the future reference exchange rate more precisely. 
There is little doubt among economists that euro membership will bring enduring net benefits to Poland. 
It will lower transaction costs and increase labor productivity. 
But it will do so only if serious institutional deficiencies are eliminated. 
Poland’s new government faces several serious challenges, not the least of which will be to reconcile its liberal and populist tendencies. 
Only if populism is put at the service of liberal reform will the government achieve lasting benefits. 
The Right Priorities for the G8 
Blair is right in challenging us to set priorities. But his choice is probably wrong. 
While we should accept his challenge, we should also get our priorities right. 
Political leaders rarely espouse clear priorities, preferring to seem capable of giving everything to everybody. 
But not talking about priorities does not make the need to prioritize go away. 
Instead, the choices only become less clear, less democratic, and less efficient. 
Refusing to prioritize, dealing mainly with the most publicized problems, is wrong. 
Refusing to prioritize is unjust, wastes resources, and costs lives. 
So what should be our top global priorities? 
This question was addressed in a groundbreaking project involving a long list of the world’s top economists at the Copenhagen Consensus last year. 
The top priority turned out to be HIV/AIDS prevention. 
A comprehensive program would cost $27 billion, but the potential social benefits would be immense: avoidance of more than 28 million new cases of HIV/AIDS by 2010. 
This makes it the best investment the world could make, reaping social benefits that outweigh the costs by 40 to 1. 
If we could only find the political will, establishing free trade could be achieved at a very low cost, with benefits of up to $2.4 trillion a year. 
Fighting malaria pays off at least five times the costs. 
Mosquito nets and effective medication could halve the incidence of malaria and would cost $13 billion. 
Given that these problems are most acute in Africa, Blair’s priorities have some merit. 
But the Copenhagen Consensus showed us not only what we should be doing, but also what should not be done – at least not right now. 
The experts rated responses to climate change extremely low on the “to do” list. 
In fact, the panel called these ventures – including the Kyoto Protocol – “bad projects” because they cost more than the good they do. 
This does not mean that we should ignore climate change. 
Global warming is real. 
Given scarce resources, we must ask ourselves: do we want to do a lot of good now, or a little good much later? 
We need to ask if we can do more for the world by investing differently. 
Far from suggesting a policy of laissez faire, this question addresses the pressing problem of prioritization head on. 
Why did thousands die in Haiti during the recent hurricanes and not in Florida? 
Because Haitians are poor. 
They cannot take preventive measures. 
The G-8 meeting has put global prioritization on the agenda. 
Now is the time to get our priorities right. 
The urgent problem of the poor majority of this world is not climate change. 
We can prevent HIV by handing out condoms and improving health education. 
We can prevent millions from dying from malnutrition simply by distributing vitamin supplements. 
These are not space-age technologies, but staple goods that the world needs. 
Doing the best things first would be a great investment in the planet’s future. 
If we are serious about solving the world’s most serious challenges, we owe it to ourselves to set the right priorities. 
Anchoring the Arab Awakening 
LONDON – The economic situation in the countries of the so-called Arab Awakenings is deteriorating quickly. 
More frequent and longer-lasting power outages foretell worse to come in an economy already struggling with mass unemployment, widespread exclusion, and deep pockets of poverty. 
Short-term macroeconomic stability is the immediate priority in Egypt and the other Arab Awakening countries. 
His proposal of an Arab Stabilization Plan, inspired by the post-1945 Marshall Plan in Western Europe, is laudable. 
The imperative for large-scale coordinated action is overwhelming. But is the Marshall Plan the right model? 
Excessive red tape and ineffective enforcement of competition policy and governance rules are hampering entrepreneurship throughout the region. 
Two days of intensive discussions revealed important differences in perspective, but also many commonalities. 
Private-sector development clearly means different things to different people. 
Moreover, the existing banks have failed to serve these parties’ small-business and farming constituencies. 
Achieving ambitious goals for inclusive growth and job creation quickly without an enabling state and without using the banking system will be extremely difficult. 
Without question, the main responsibility for building these countries’ political systems and reforming their economies rests with their citizens. 
Outside intervention has left too many scars in the public’s collective memory. 
Much can also be learned from countries like Turkey, which has managed to create a dynamic and innovative private sector. 
The good news is that the economies of the Arab Awakening countries do not suffer from the deep distortions that characterized post-communist Europe. 
Many of the early reforms have already been implemented, and reasonably sophisticated banking systems are in place. 
In post-communist Europe, banks had to be built from scratch out of the rubble of socialism. 
As a result, while political uncertainty will take its toll on economic growth, the Arab Awakening countries should not have to face a transitional recession, as post-communist Europe did in the 1990’s. 
Jafar is right that the Arab Awakening countries need a plan. 
But it should be a plan for private-sector-led inclusive growth, supported by efforts in the rest of the Arab world and in the EU. 
Most critically, it must be a plan owned by the countries themselves and based on an approach that recognizes the critical roles of an enabling state and a catalytic financial sector. 
The Right to Die 
On December 21, an Italian doctor, Mario Riccio, disconnected a respirator that was keeping Piergiorgio Welby alive. 
Welby, who suffered from muscular dystrophy and was paralyzed, had battled unsuccessfully in the Italian courts for the right to die. 
After Riccio gave him a sedative and switched off the respirator, Welby said “thank you” three times to his wife, his friends, and his doctor. 
Forty-five minutes later, he was dead. 
Welby’s request to die was widely publicized in Italy, where it led to heated debate. 
At the time of writing, it is unclear whether Riccio will be charged with any offense. 
At least one Italian politician has called for his arrest on a charge of homicide. 
Welby’s death raises two questions, which need to be distinguished. 
One is whether a person has a right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment. 
The other is whether voluntary euthanasia is ethically defensible. 
Forcing medical treatment on a competent adult patient who does not want it is tantamount to assault. 
We may think that the patient is making the wrong decision, but we should respect his or her right to make it. 
That right is recognized in most countries, but not, apparently, in Italy. 
That document states that to refuse a burdensome medical treatment “is not the equivalent of suicide.” 
That description applies well to Welby’s decision. 
Death is, of course, a foreseeable consequence of avoiding that burden, but it is a byproduct that is not directly intended. 
If the patient could avoid the burden and yet continue to live, that would be his choice. 
This distinction is dubious. 
But it does so at the cost of rendering incoherent its own vigorous opposition to assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia. 
Many countries recognize a legal right to refuse medical treatment. 
The Netherlands, in particular, has been subjected to a relentless campaign of vilification. 
Critics allege that the legalization of voluntary euthanasia has led to a breakdown of trust in the medical profession and all sorts of other dire consequences. 
But if these allegations are true, no one has told the Dutch. 
Despite a change of government in the Netherlands since voluntary euthanasia was legalized, no effort has been made to repeal the measure. 
There is simply no public support for such a move. 
Isn’t that a choice that everyone should have? 
The Right to Equality, Then and Now 
Comparisons and contrasts with the Great Depression of the 1930’s have inevitably become a central part of that discourse – and rightly so. 
There is much that the world can and must learn now from the lowest point of the twentieth century. 
Above all, we have got to heed the proven need for applying social – as well as economic – interventions in a time of economic crisis. 
Recession and depression can lead to exclusion and, at worst, persecution of societies’ most vulnerable groups. 
That is why the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights was adopted in 1948, and why we need, more urgently than ever, to establish universal equality for all human beings. 
Needless to say, reaching a consensus among such a diverse group of people from around the world was not easy. 
Equality means different things to different people – and at different times. 
Interpretations largely depend on the practical realities of the social, cultural, and political environment in which the principles of equality operate. 
The result was a compromise between these two groups. 
They must, instead, encourage nations positively to promote the principle of equal rights in keeping with current interpretations of international obligation. 
The declaration that we have developed regards equality as a “freestanding right.” 
In other words, it exists as a separate right, and is not dependent on the violation of some other legal right, such as the right to education. 
The right to equality would exist in all areas of activity regulated by domestic, international or regional law. 
A new declaration was badly needed when we began work on it one year ago. 
Today, it is crucial if we are to prevent an even greater chasm from dividing the world’s haves and have-nots. 
The Right to Massacre? 
Predictably, the Arizona tragedy has elicited calls for policy changes. 
But what, if anything, should be done differently? 
The vast majority of severely mentally disordered individuals are not violent. 
Predicting which few without a prior history of violence will become violent is almost impossible. 
At the same time, proposals to protect society from the dangerously mentally ill pose basic civil-liberties issues. 
It’s the reverse side of freedom. 
And many people outside would also say the ‘freedom’ of a deranged mind to react in a violent way is also American.” 
President Barack Obama’s press secretary answered defensively that American values do not endorse violence. 
That is true, but irrelevant. 
The question is whether American values favoring individual rights somehow facilitated the Arizona tragedy. 
One freedom-related suggestion is that the US needs stricter laws that keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. 
But the alleged shooter had never been formally diagnosed as mentally ill, so such targeted laws would not have prevented him from obtaining a gun. 
General gun control is essential, but unlikely for now. 
The US also needs more accessible mental-health services. 
Many colleges have increased monitoring of students’ odd behavior by threat-assessment teams. 
But such mass screening is notoriously ineffective in predicting violence, often yielding enormous numbers of misidentified threats. 
For example, psychiatric screening for suicide risk in one New York high school identified 44% of the student body as being at risk. 
Similarly, screening for loose, eccentric thinking yields mostly individuals who never become psychiatrically disordered. 
With such blatant signals, why didn’t others intervene? 
Though his community college suspended the suspect for his threatening demeanor, it took no further action. 
Additional privacy protections for medical records sometimes make it difficult to notify parents when a child is troubled. 
College counselors apparently did not think that the suspect met this demanding threshold. 
Although disruptive, the suspect was able to function – as shown by the disciplined nature of the attack. 
Such protections should not be surrendered easily. 
The irony of Sitov’s comment is that during the Soviet era, Russian political dissidents were psychiatrically diagnosed, institutionalized, and drugged into submission. 
The line between angry political extremism or eccentric normality and delusional mental disorder is tricky to draw. 
If restrictions on involuntary commitment to prevent crime are eased, zealous prosecutors could circumvent civil liberties. 
Such abuses have emerged when preventive institutionalization has passed constitutional muster, as in the laws some US states have enacted in order to incarcerate “sexually violent predators.” 
So, what can be done? 
Adequate community mental-health services with educational outreach can induce disturbed youth to get help voluntarily. 
Perhaps prudent loosening of the imminent-harm standard for involuntary commitment in clear cases of severe disorder might be helpful. 
Screening, if carefully targeted to limit errors, also may have a role to play. 
Finally, improved gun control vis-à-vis the severely mentally ill is imperative. 
Such measures might have prevented the Arizona shootings. 
If he refused treatment and was released because he posed no imminent threat, his severe mental disorder would nonetheless have been diagnosed. 
The Right Way to Beat Chinese Inflation 
As a result, the People’s Bank of China has raised interest rates substantially and increased banks’ reserve requirements. 
The risks are high. 
China’s accelerating inflation reflects a similar climb in its GDP growth rate, from the already high 11% in 2006 to 11.5 % in 2007. 
In these circumstances, continuing to raise borrowing costs would be a mistake. 
To be sure, the prolonged rapid increase in Chinese aggregate demand has been fueled by an investment boom, as well as a growing trade surplus. 
Thus, lowering inflation would require reducing the growth rate (if not the level) of these two demand components. 
A sizeable reduction in aggregate demand through RMB appreciation is achievable without being imprudent, because the current-account surplus in 2007 was 9.5 % of GDP. 
This is because manufactured exports are typically more labor-intensive than investment projects. 
As a result, a RMB1 billion reduction in exports would create more unemployment than a RMB1 billion reduction in investment spending. 
But tomorrow’s capacity expansion from today’s investment would mean a permanent increase in the number of jobs created from tomorrow onward. 
Nevertheless, China must be careful when implementing RMB appreciation. 
Policy makers should closely monitor potential changes in the economic conditions in the G-7. 
In that case, a large RMB appreciation undertaken now would be overkill. 
Moreover, the authorities should recognize that RMB appreciation is unlikely to reduce US-China trade tensions. 
So Japan-bashing continued under a new guise: the additional demand that Japan must remove its “structural impediments” to import. 
In the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies, possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit. 
A stronger RMB can help only the overheated Chinese economy. 
And it has the virtue of doing so without hurting China’s future production capacity. 
The Right Way to Electric Cars 
NEW YORK – Excitement about electric cars abounds nowadays, but consider the number of existing gasoline-powered cars: about 850 million. 
It would take years of new-car sales to make a dent in that number. 
That idea would solve a lot of problems, starting not just with today’s installed base of cars, but with the installed base of car makers . 
Even though many of them are in trouble, it’s probably not the best time to start a new car company, either. 
Yet while the market for new cars has slowed dramatically, it could be a good time to start a business replacing gasoline engines with electric ones. 
The group’s initiative, led by Räsänen, is called eCars - Now! 
Some companies will make batteries or electric engines or retrofit kits; others will retrofit gasoline cars with the new engines – a great job opportunity for unemployed auto workers. 
eCars- Now! hopes to foster an ecosystem of car service workers and parts makers similar to the ecosystem of open-software programmers and generic computer hardware. 
Of course, the parallels end at some point, because batteries and engines aren’t quite the equivalent of PCs, but the ethos is much the same. 
Räsänen and his team started by measuring the potential demand for electric cars in Finland. 
“No one had done that before in Finland,” he recalls. 
It took eCars – Now! only 11 days to sign up 500 interested customers. 
To be sure, they merely indicated interest; they did not send money. 
The site also solicited advice on which car to convert. 
The Toyota Corolla was the first choice – hardly surprising since it is the leading car model in Finland (with 7% of the market). 
What will it take to make this idea work? 
Local efforts may succeed or fail based on the talents of local implementers. 
In Italy, inventor Roberto Vezzi had a Smart-EV project along the same lines. 
He has now joined the eCars – Now! movement, and his eSmart car will be upgraded with the open-source graphical user interface being developed for the eCorolla in Finland. 
Other initiatives are springing up in Denmark, Latvia, Spain, and Turkey, says Räsänen. 
The group is now looking for an initial manufacturer/assembler for the retrofit kits (as opposed to the engines inside them). 
In the meantime, eCorolla and the eSmart will go through testing. 
Overall, the economics make sense. 
It should take about eight hours for two workers in a professional garage to install such a kit, or less than a week for the car-owner himself/herself (or, as they say, two weeks if the owner’s spouse “helps”). 
That’s considerably less than the cost of a new car – especially an electric one. 
The real economic benefit, however, is in the cost savings thereafter. 
To be sure, a lot will depend on the availability of convenient charging stations, but they are starting to appear. 
The project is deconstructing the car industry – probably in a more effective way than American government officials are doing in Detroit. 
In Finland, at least, all you need from the government is a certificate of inspection, which costs about €100 ($135). 
Dealers and mechanics will install the batteries, comprising a new corps of workers devoted (indirectly) to cleaning up the environment and adding value to the installed base of cars. 
Any far-sighted government could help not by subsidizing these efforts, but by buying up the old gasoline engines. 
(Many European governments currently have “cash-for-clunker” schemes that buy and destroy old cars; a cash-for-gas-engines scheme would make more sense by lowering costs and conserving the many car bodies that still work fine.) 
This project might have seemed quixotic a few years ago, but now it fits the times perfectly. 
It’s modest at a time when the world is in recession. 
There may not yet be a ready-made solution for you unless you live in Finland, but that’s just the point: you can start a local version. 
The Right Way to Rebuild Georgia 
That’s the good news. 
The bad news is that the meeting was restricted to donors and Georgia’s government, with Transparency International criticizing its opaque decision-making process. 
And governments that are not accountable to their citizens will most likely fail in this regard. 
But reintegration of conflict-ridden groups into productive activities is a sine qua non for political, economic, and social stability. 
The UN reckons that countries that fail in this endeavor have an even chance of reverting to conflict. 
So, has Georgia’s development model been conducive to dynamic and inclusive growth, that is, growth that leads to productive investment, innovative practices, and widespread job creation? 
Foreign investors have responded by pouring resources into the country. 
But rapid growth is not enough. 
Georgia has failed to create the jobs, dynamism, and inclusion that are necessary for a peaceful society. 
Moreover, military expenditure has increased from 1% to 7% of GDP since 2003, drawing resources away from human development into unproductive investment. 
Unemployment is high, income disparities have worsened, and corruption remains widespread, notwithstanding important improvements in recent years. 
The UN High Commission for Refugees forecasts that 73,000 of the roughly 127,000 IDPs created by the South Ossetian crisis will probably return to their place of origin by early winter. Given 220,000 IPDs from previous conflicts in the 1990’s now face fading prospects for a return to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia’s authorities must find a viable and permanent solution for roughly 6% of the population. 
Without a solution to the IPD problem, efforts to strengthen political stability and security will fail. And, in the absence of stability and security, the objective of the IMF’s $750 million stand-by arrangement to cover the “temporary external financing gap” and to sustain “the confidence of markets and investors” will not be met. 
The challenge now is to redesign Georgia’s aid package to focus primarily on the provision of “reconstruction aid” that promotes investment and employment. 
Laissez-faire will not do it. 
The Rights of Apes – and Humans 
The resolution, which the full parliament is expected to adopt, directs the Spanish government to promote a similar European Union-wide declaration. 
Keeping great apes in captivity will be allowed for purposes of conservation only, and then under optimal conditions for the apes. 
Moreover, it recommends that Spain take steps in international forums and organizations to ensure that great apes are protected from maltreatment, slavery, torture, being killed, and being made extinct. 
Paola Cavalieri and I founded The Great Ape Project in 1993 to break down the barriers between human and nonhuman animals. 
The Great Ape Project seeks to change the way we think about great apes, and ultimately, about animals in general. 
The Spanish resolution marks the first official acceptance of that view. 
Yet a court has now remanded all ten to be held in prison until September. 
After 17 days in prison, three people were accused of threatening a press officer for a fashion store by hindering her from driving away. 
In recent years, Austrian animal-welfare organizations have been remarkably successful in persuading voters and legislators to support laws phasing out cages for egg-laying hens, cages for raising rabbits for meat, and raising animals for fur. 
The police persecution of the animal movement appears to be an attempt by the conservative party, which controls the Ministry of the Interior, and its animal industry supporters to strike back at a legitimate, peaceful challenge to the way we treat animals. 
The Rise and Fall of Meritocracy 
Meritocracy: the word sounds nothing but good. 
It means rule by those who have merit. 
Such merit is usually understood to be academic achievement, a combination of talent and training. 
This is measured by academic degrees, which in turn are graded on merit: A, B, C, D, or First, Upper Second, Lower Second, Third. 
Who would not wish to live in a meritocracy? 
So meritocracy seems preferable, at least at first sight. 
But, on closer inspection, things are not so simple. 
For many, France has long been the epitome of meritocracy. 
Most of those in the top reaches of not only the civil service and the judiciary, but also politics, business, and academia used to be graduates of the famous grandes écoles . 
Many then went through the rigorous training to become inspecteurs de finance , senior state officials. 
Yet the French elites today are increasingly held in suspicion, and even reviled, by part of the population. 
Certainly, French leaders are not immune to corruption. 
The uneasy relationship of money and politics has given rise to several high-profile scandals in recent years. 
Japan’s meritocratically selected bureaucracy, too, faces much the same public opprobrium. 
Indeed, the bureaucracy itself is often blamed for the country’s rigidity and ongoing stagnation. 
In Britain, a government heading for its third term in office has said more than once that it wants the country to be “meritocratic.” 
Chancellor Gordon Brown, Tony Blair’s heir apparent, is particularly eager to go down that road. 
His was not a description of the road to the promised land, but a dystopian vision of almost Orwellian dimensions. 
Meritocracy was Young’s “1984.” 
Two central questions raised by Young remain topical today. 
First, if academic achievement is the entry ticket to power and status, what about the rest? 
What about those who do not make it to university? 
How do the other 50% fare in a meritocratic world? 
According to Young, those who have at least some talent will form a “pioneer corps” of plumbers and builders and other skilled workers. 
Those who do not even make that grade will remain in a “home help corps” of unskilled laborers. 
Young’s bleak picture bears an eerie resemblance to today’s world. 
The new underclass is the other side of the meritocratic elite. 
Immigrants, in particular, do not enjoy the equality of opportunity that the word “merit” suggests. 
Indeed, nowadays meritocracy seems to be simply another version of the inequality that characterises all societies. 
Instead, they must conclude that they personally failed, and that no amount of effort can save them. 
Like all elites before them, they become firmly established – and use all available means to keep it that way. 
There is no need to follow Young’s argument all the way to the eventual revolution. 
There is a need, however, for a healthy skepticism towards the claims of a meritocracy based on academic achievement alone. 
Such a society is not the answer to all our prayers for decency and fairness, or even for sensible and good decisions. 
It is far better to remember that when it comes to leadership, many qualities other than a first-class degree come into play. 
Diversity is a better guarantee of openness than even merit, and openness is the real hallmark of a liberal order. 
The Rise and Fall of Putinism 
MOSCOW – How did “Putinism” – that distinctively Russian blend of authoritarian politics and dirigiste economics – happen? 
And, now that it has, how can Russians move beyond it, to realize the rights and liberties promised to them in the country’s constitution? 
An active Russian civil society, which seemed to appear out of nowhere in Mikhail Gorbachev’s Soviet Union of 1989-1990 after the long Soviet hibernation, receded far too quickly. 
The astounding difficulty of everyday survival following the USSR’s collapse trapped most Russians into focusing on their families’ most urgent needs. 
Civic apathy set in. 
So Vladimir Putin came to power at a very convenient moment for any ruler – when the people are quiescent. 
Until recently, both sides adhered to this tacit contract. 
But, with the global financial crisis, the Kremlin stopped meeting its side of the bargain. 
Putin and his entourage “tightened the screws” on Russia’s people over the past decade, and faced almost no resistance to their claims to unchecked power. Now, from the entire spectrum of civil and political rights enumerated in Russia’s Constitution, we Russians have only one right remaining: the right to leave and return to the country freely. 
But Russian citizens, especially younger ones, are beginning to realize what they have lost. 
By the same token, the post-Soviet generation has a very different idea of a decent standard of living than their parents had, and hence their aspirations are much higher. 
Many have traveled abroad, and all have seen foreign films, from which they have learned that people of their social status in the West have a far more comfortable life than they do. 
Now the young feel deprived if they can’t have all of that. 
At first, people did not think of civil rights as they strove for such previously unknown comforts. 
They relied on the Kremlin to set the conditions that would give them new opportunities. 
Now, they are gradually coming to understand that the government has failed them. 
A struggle for the restitution of constitutional rights in Russia first became noticeable in 2009. 
At Triumph Square in Moscow, protestors have consistently demanded that Article 31, which guarantees the right to peaceful assembly, be respected. 
Movement-31, an umbrella grouping of like-minded protestors, has spread rapidly, staging simultaneous demonstrations in Moscow and 48 other cities two months ago in support of the right to free assembly. 
For ordinary citizens, who have neither access to the media nor personal contacts with the authorities, protests are an opportunity to inform officials of their demands, requests, and suggestions. 
Most recently, the Internet has become a means of public control over civil-rights violations by the authorities, as images taken with mobile phones become available instantaneously to all. 
Russia’s federal government and regional authorities are clearly alarmed by this rapidly growing civic activism. 
But, despite changed conditions, they respond with the same old methods – suppression, intimidation, and misinformation. 
And, with elections to the State Duma due in December 2011, followed by the presidential election in March 2012, officials are particularly concerned by an upsurge of civic activism. 
Over the past decade, the electoral system was “improved” in such a way that no outcome can lead to a change in the federal government. 
That leaves street demonstrations and other forms of civic activism as the only way to challenge Putinism’s standard-bearers. 
Indeed, given state control of the mainstream media, such activism may be the only way to learn what citizens really think about their rulers. 
The Rise of Chinese “Sea Power” 
In an age of missiles and terrorist threats, many people think that “sea power” is a word and concept from the past. 
Not in China. 
Many of China’s neighbors are alarmed. 
China seeks not only to secure its energy supplies, but to achieve broader security goals. 
Indeed, China’s ties with Myanmar’s military dictators look set to turn into a de facto military alliance. 
On the Spratley and Paracel islands -- seized from Vietnam and the Philippines respectively -- China is building port facilities to moor large surface ships and runways large enough to handle long-range bombers. 
In effect, China is in the process of building a group of literally unsinkable aircraft carriers in the middle of the South China Sea. 
Why is China, usually considered a “continental power,” engaging in this maritime expansion? 
In The Influence of Sea Power upon History, published in 1890, Mahan argued that maritime power and economic development were deeply intertwined. 
Only the ability to protect trade and project power by sea could assure the vitality of this nexus. 
Mahan identified the conditions that determine “sea power”: 
· geographical position and environment; 
· territorial capacity, specifically coastline 
· population; 
· character of people attuned to maritime expeditions; 
· character of government eager to ebrace “sea power”. 
These conditions applied to the US of Mahan’s time, and they surely apply to China today. 
China is already the world’s third largest trading nation and rapidly developing its port capacities to manage an ever-increasing volume of trade. 
However, unlike the US and Britain in the past, China today must turn to overseas bases rather than colonization to enhance its “sea power” – hence its “string of pearls.” 
By 2010, China is expected to have 70 of the most modern surface vessels, several modern strategic nuclear submarines, and several tens of modernized attack submarines, exceeding the modern forces of both Taiwan’s navy and even Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force, at least in quantitative terms. 
This will provide China with necessary capabilities to invade, should China’s rulers wish, Japan’s most remote islands, including the disputed Senkaku Islands, as well as Taiwan. 
If China’s naval growth continues at its current pace, it may have the world’s largest naval force by 2020. 
All of Asia must wake up to the arrival of Chinese-style aggressive “sea power.” 
The Rise of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis 
BALTIMORE -- Tuberculosis, one of the most deadly infectious diseases, is back with a vengeance, especially in Africa. 
Fifteen years ago, an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in New York City induced near panic, before a massive infusion of funds into the public health infrastructure turned the tide in the United States, and public interest waned. 
However, the problem of drug resistance has persisted, and efforts to contain it globally have not been sufficient. 
The World Health Organization estimates that there were 425,000 new MDR-TB cases in 2004, with China, India, and Russia accounting for just over 60%. 
In a study at the Church of Scotland Hospital in rural KwaZulu-Natal province of 535 patients who had confirmed tuberculosis, 221 had MDR-TB, a level 10 times greater than in the province as a whole. More alarmingly, 53 of the 221 had a strain that was also resistant to the two most clinically useful classes of second-line TB drugs. 
Molecular typing of the isolates indicated that 85% were clonally related, implying epidemic transmission of XDR strains, most likely in HIV clinics and hospital wards. 
Are similar localized outbreaks going unrecognized elsewhere? 
More importantly, can XDR-TB be controlled? 
Resistance to anti-TB drugs arises from selection of naturally occurring mutants with innate resistance to drugs. 
Once this resistance develops, treatment is compromised, further resistance can evolve, and resistant organisms can be transmitted to other people, leading to primary drug resistance that may fail to respond to standard therapy. 
Effective treatment and cure of MDR-TB requires prolonged use (typically two years) of a combination of drugs, including second-line drugs that for the most part are less potent than first-line agents, more toxic, or both. 
If the same factors that produce MDR-TB remain in play, then MDR-TB becomes XDR-TB. 
There is no magic bullet for controlling XDR-TB. 
Addressing drug-resistant TB cannot be divorced from overall TB control efforts. 
Access to HIV care, including ART, is also urgently needed, and reducing HIV incidence would substantially reduce the TB burden over the longer term. 
Enhanced surveillance also is needed. 
The Rise of Liberal Japan 
Most people looking at the rise of Asian power focus on China and India. 
In addition, Japan spends $40 billion annually on defense, and has one of the top five military forces in the world. 
Japan has played a unique role in world history. 
Moreover, Japan has reinvented itself twice. 
Unfortunately, Japan moved onto militaristic imperialism in the 1930’s, which eventually led to its surrender and occupation in 1945. 
As Kenneth Pyle argues in his interesting new book Japan Rising , these reinventions were responses to external shifts in world politics. 
Now, with the growth of Chinese power, one of the great questions for this century will be how Japan responds. 
The Japanese are currently debating their role in global politics. 
Public opinion is divided on the issue, and polls vary according to how the questions are asked. 
Nonetheless, many astute analysts believe that the constitution will be amended within the coming decade. 
In May, Asahi Shimbun , a major newspaper known for its left/liberal inclination, proposed an alternative vision for twenty-first century Japan in a series of 21 editorials. 
Conservative voices argue just the opposite – that abolishing Article 9 is important for exactly such reasons. 
Japan has become more willing to use its power, and more aware of changes in the external balance of power. 
It is rising, but how? 
As one Japanese liberal commented to me, “this is our third response to globalization. 
What can we contribute this time?” 
The Rise of Mid-Level Powers 
However, like-minded mid-level powers with similar intentions could complement what the UN or the US lacks, effectively generating sufficient clout to stabilize the global security environment. 
Japan, Australia, Germany, or Canada might be just such powers. 
They share common values as free and democratic countries. 
Moreover, they are non-nuclear powers with no permanent seats in the UN Security Council. 
All are long time allies of the US. 
Nevertheless, subtle differences among these countries may influence their bilateral cooperation or coordination with the UN or the US. 
As a result, they must compliment each other’s advantages, characteristics, and interests in order to optimize their role in promoting international security. 
For many years, Japan has been taking very cautious steps into this area, but substantial changes have occurred recently. 
In March 2007, Japan agreed to enter a “semi-alliance” with Australia, and issued a “Joint Communiqué on Japan-Australia Security Cooperation.” 
Under Japan’s last two prime ministers, Japan has steadily been making practical contributions to the stabilization of the international security environment as a way to benefit its national and international interests. 
However, efforts to promote this kind of cooperation should not be confined to these mid-level powers. 
There are many other potential mid-level democratic countries that should take part. 
Various approaches may be available for building a coalition of such powers, including the use of the UN and seeking to influence US foreign policy. 
China’s E-Tail Revolution 
SHANGHAI – When you think about centers of technological innovation, Silicon Valley, Seattle, and Seoul are probably the first places that come to mind. 
Indeed, on April 29, Alibaba signaled its ambitions by buying an 18% stake in Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. 
And, as with technology hubs elsewhere, innovations born in Hangzhou are determining the development path of related industries. 
China’s e-tail market is the world’s second largest (after that of the United States), with an estimated $210 billion in revenue last year. 
Since 2003, the market has posted a compound annual growth rate of over 110%. 
By 2020, China’s e-tail market could be as large as today’s markets in the US, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France combined. 
Two features of Chinese e-commerce stand out. 
First, roughly 90% of Chinese e-tail is conducted on ad-funded virtual marketplaces. On these platforms – which resemble eBay and Amazon Marketplace – manufacturers, retailers, and individuals offer products and services to consumers through online storefronts. 
Moreover, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, online purchases in China do not simply replace offline purchases. Rather, e-tail supports incremental consumption: $1 of online consumption seems to generate roughly $0.40 of additional sales. 
And incremental spending as a share of total spending is even higher in China’s less-developed cities, where a shortage of brick-and-mortar retailers means that online shopping provides access to otherwise unavailable products and brands. 
Mass consumption in China and other emerging economies is coming of age in the Internet era. 
Given that industry structures are still developing in many of these countries, e-tail is set to shape not only the retail landscape, but also the manufacturing and financial-services industries – and even the urban landscape itself. 
And establishing a strong physical presence throughout the country will be time-consuming and expensive. 
By contrast, Alibaba (which owns marketplaces such as Taobao) and 360buy.com (which focuses on electronics) rank among China’s top ten retailers, and already provide national coverage through the reach of express delivery companies. 
As a result, China’s retail sector seems more likely to follow a two-stage development path, with e-tailers emerging as the major national players. 
The ability afforded by online marketplaces to new players to attain national – and international – prominence without massive upfront investment will profoundly affect how both retailers and manufacturers approach new consumer markets. 
Likewise, by removing some of the benefits of scale and specialization that characterize the consumer-goods industry elsewhere, e-tail enables new manufacturers to join the market, selling goods like apparel and cosmetics directly from workshops and factories to consumers. 
Finally, e-tail could shape China’s urban development and transform leisure activities. 
Citizens will spend more free time engaging in other activities, such as dining out. 
All of these changes could alter the use and pricing of real estate. 
Other emerging markets are likely to follow a similar course. 
Chinese e-tailers are already using their advantages in exporting products from the country’s factories to expand internationally. 
And enterprises in other countries are adopting a similar online business model. 
China may have largely missed the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century. 
But its approach to e-tail is poised to be one of the forces shaping the emerging-market Internet revolution of the twenty-first century. 
The Rise of Regionalism in Asia 
This week, America and Singapore ironed out the final stumbling blocks to a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA). 
Such pacts are spreading like wildfire across Asia. 
Until recently, most East Asian countries pursued non-discriminatory trade policies through unilateral liberalisation, the Asian/Pacific Economic Community, and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 
As the US/Singapore deal shows, discriminatory bilateral and regional initiatives are growing more popular. 
An East Asian economic bloc forming around either China and/or Japan now seems plausible. 
Will all this deal-making sideline the region in the WTO? 
East Asian countries have relatively liberal trade policies and are reasonably well integrated into the global economy. 
This, however, masks huge differences. 
Hong Kong and Singapore are free ports. 
South Korea and Taiwan liberalised substantially in recent years. 
Malaysia is fairly open but with significant protection, especially in services. 
Thai protectionism remains high. 
Indonesia and the Philippines are mired in political and economic instability. 
Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, all very poor, have higher levels of protection. 
Now consider the two regional engines, Japan and China. 
Japan's sclerotic domestic economy makes it incapable of exerting regional leadership. 
On trade policy it is defensive, especially in its addiction to agricultural protectionism. 
China presents a different picture. 
Its WTO commitments are the strongest of any developing country. 
The upshot is that the emerging market policy environment is a lot more competitive, especially in terms of attracting FDI. 
Traces of the "new regionalism" can be found everywhere. 
Singapore pioneered this approach. 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is talking to several third countries. 
To date only a proposed ASEAN-China FTA has got off the starting blocks. 
Similar initiatives are afoot in Northeast Asia. 
Both political and economic factors lie behind this. 
China views FTAs as a means to exercise strategic leadership in the region. 
In such a world, poor and weak countries would be losers. 
The WTO is important to East Asia, but the reverse is also true. 
Of the twenty or so active developing and newly developed countries in the WTO, almost half come from the region. 
The Doha Round will not make sustained progress without the active participation of East Asia, on individual issues and across the board. 
Because of its economic and trade muscle, China is bound to play a more prominent role as the Doha round unfolds. 
There are early, positive signs that it is adopting a "Brazilian," as opposed to an "Indian," strategy within the WTO. 
Korea is active and constructive in the WTO, except on agriculture. 
Taiwan is also set to play a constructive role--if mainland China lets it. 
The city states, Hong Kong and Singapore, have clear-sighted WTO policies, focusing on market access and strong rules. 
Malaysia and Thailand are also fairly active in the WTO, with a mix of free-market and protectionist positions. 
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are in the queue for WTO accession. 
The WTO is at a crossroads. 
It sorely needs to liberalize trade progressively. 
This is more likely under a Bush administration with better open-market credentials and a more assertive foreign policy than any Democratic alternative. 
However, Robert Zoellick, President Bush's Trade Representative, needs allies. 
Many of them--including China--are to be found in East Asia. 
The New Economy of Fealty 
But, despite large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus, they are not experiencing any dramatic economic rebound. 
Moreover, the pre-crisis trend of rising income and wealth inequality is continuing (in marked contrast to the post-Great Depression period, in which inequality declined). 
And survey data show a rapid decline in people’s satisfaction and confidence about the future. 
In the early twentieth century, a large share of even advanced economies’ populations was still employed in agriculture. 
That proportion subsequently fell sharply, and the same decline could later be seen in industrial employment. 
Since the late twentieth century, most employment growth has come in services, particularly personal services – a pattern that looks like a reversal of a previous historical trend. 
In the interwar years, these employees largely disappeared from the lives of all but the ultra-rich. 
The iconoclastic British historian A. J. P. Taylor quipped that laments about the decline of Britain were really generalized reflections of Oxford academics’ view of the “servant problem.” 
The employment of nannies, au pairs, babysitters, and day mothers reflected carefully differentiated approaches to the problem of looking after children. 
After child care, there followed hordes of private tutors, test coaches, and university admissions consultants. 
And, beyond childhood and adolescence, the need for specialized personal support only grew. 
Some of the new services would stretch the imagination of previous ages. 
Dating agencies have developed increasingly complex algorithms to sort out their clients’ romantic lives. 
Lawyers work out prenuptial contracts, and then the complexities of divorce negotiations. 
Design consultants choose our interiors and clothing. 
Personal trainers look after our fitness. 
Cosmeticians, skin-care specialists, and tattoo artists shape our appearance. 
Two of the largest areas of service-employment expansion have been education and health services. And yet this has not been a result of adding more teachers or doctors. 
Instead, a new division of labor has surrounded the classical providers of education and healing with more and more layers of administration. 
Doctors need experts to deal with insurance forms, negotiate with other doctors and pharmaceutical providers, and manage legal risks. 
Educational specialists fill every conceivable logistical and administrative gap, run sports and arts programs, guarantee diversity, and oversee technology transfer to the private sector. 
Indeed, a rapidly growing army of administrators is overrunning our universities. 
None of these new services can easily be standardized, or dealt with at long distances (as can some types of clerical legal and financial work). 
The caregivers and consultants need to be on location. 
And that raises a question of control. 
How can child-care providers be trusted? 
Cautious parents seek agents to select their employees and technology to monitor them as they work. So, to find out about the reputation of service providers, we need still more service providers: ratings and surveys and agents to tell us about agents. 
The new service economy extends market relations to areas of life in which, previously, informal assistance and guidance within family units prevailed. 
To the extent that employment and income in the new services can be easily recorded, this change implies an increase in measurable economic wealth and output, because unpaid household services are ignored in GDP calculations. 
Experts might thus interpret the macroeconomic consequences as largely positive. 
But the element of personal dependence is a throwback to the preindustrial world. 
Today’s new service economy is driven by the resulting uncertainty over identity. 
We need advice on every aspect of life, provided in a complex world by people whom we think to be experts in ever-narrower and more specialized fields. 
Are we dating more people who share our perceived interests? 
We are moving back to the Sun King’s world, in which everything personal is known, rumored, or whispered. 
But now, with electronic surveillance, personal dependence has never been more extreme, more humiliating, and more depressing. 
This might explain some of the public dissatisfaction captured in so many surveys, even when economic conditions are not dire. 
Subjectively, modern growth feels problematic, and perhaps even immoral. 
The Rise of the Beijing Consensus 
BRUSSELS – President Barack Obama’s first appearances outside North America – in London, Strasbourg, Prague, and Istanbul – galvanized world attention. 
The question now is what is likely to replace it. 
Although China is often said to lack “soft power,” many of its ideas on economics and governance are coming into ascendance. 
All these factors are not only part of China’s economic rescue package, but of Obama’s stimulus plan as well. 
Rather than obsessing about elections, the US now seeks to build pragmatic alliances to buttress its economic needs. 
What matters in this worldview is not the nature of any country’s political system, but the extent to which it improves its people’s wellbeing. 
At the diplomatic level, this implies that national interests, not universal norms, should drive cooperation. 
This diplomatic and economic realism is more than a reversal of the neo-conservative muscle-flexing of the George W. Bush years. 
It is an attempt by a declining power to use its restrained capabilities in a more economical way. 
America’s new pragmatism is also the consequence of a process of “reverse socialization.” 
Over the past two decades, the US and its European allies believed that they could inculcate the rest of the world with their economic and political principles. 
Countries like China became enmeshed in a web of multilateral organizations and subjugated to conditional engagement strategies. 
Nowadays, the West does not have the leverage to enforce these conditions. 
Moreover, the majority of developing countries now actively embrace multilateral bodies as part of their development strategies. 
America’s policy shift will inevitably erode the Western liberal axis. 
Its strategic relevance, even in the transatlantic partnership, is destined to weaken further. 
Realism will give the US more maneuverability in the short term, but it will have to sacrifice some of its soft power to achieve this. 
The same will apply for other powers. 
But this rising Beijing Consensus offers no guarantee of stability. 
A concert of powers is only as strong as its weakest pillar, and requires a great deal of self-discipline and restraint. 
It remains to be seen how the American public will respond to its national U-turn. 
If one main player slides back into economic turmoil, nationalism will reduce the scope for pragmatic bargaining. 
Overlapping spheres of influence and frozen conflicts could again cause major conflict. 
And, if China comes out of the crisis as the big winner and continues to boost its power, zero-sum thinking will soon replace win-win cooperation. 
The Rise of the BRICs 
PRINCETON -- The winners of the great globalization push of the 1990’s were small states such as New Zealand, Chile, Dubai, Finland, Ireland, the Baltic Republics, Slovenia, and Slovakia. 
Even South Korea, which is a giant in comparison, was only half a country. 
But, at the same time, small states are also more likely to be successful in defending crucial aspects of the welfare state. 
In a small-state setting, imposition of a dense network of controls is likely to lead to the loss of mobile factors of production, while in a large state it is harder for labor or capital to escape. 
Small states’ nervousness and fear began to increase roughly in 2000. 
The new political realities were highlighted by the Iraq war, China’s search for energy sources in developing countries, and Russia’s assertiveness in foreign and domestic policy. 
They have their own problems, but at the same time they are likely to behave more like traditional big states, and will try to shape globalization rather than simply accepting it as an inevitable process. 
There are at least three obvious flaws that afflict these big globalizers much more than the small globalizers who had done so well previously. 
First, highly populous countries must integrate their poor and ill-educated underclass (in China and India mostly rural) as they engage with world markets. 
Third, Russia is already facing massive demographic decline and an aging and sickening population; 
China faces the near certainty of a Japanese-style demographic downturn from the 2040’s onward, a belated legacy of its one-child policy. 
But for the moment they are unquestionably powerful. 
The result is that the BRICs will look for compensating power, and military and strategic influence and prestige, as a way to solve internal problems. 
That hope soon proved illusory. 
Many commentators, indeed, were stunned by the rapidity with which tensions returned to the international system. 
The Rising Power of NGO's 
When Human Rights Watch declared last January that the Iraq War did not qualify as a humanitarian intervention, the international media took notice. 
As these examples suggest, today's information age has been marked by the growing role of non-governmental organizations (NGO's) on the international stage. 
Nor do numbers tell the whole story, because they represent only formally constituted organizations. 
Because they attract followers, governments must take them into account both as allies and adversaries. 
A few decades ago, large organizations like multinational corporations or the Roman Catholic Church were the most typical type of transnational organization. 
These flexible groups are particularly effective in penetrating states without regard to borders. 
A rough way to gauge the increasing importance of transnational organizations is to count how many times these organizations are mentioned in mainstream media publications. 
The use of the term "non-governmental organization" or "NGO" has increased 17-fold since 1992. 
In addition to Human Rights Watch, other NGO's such as Transparency International, Oxfam, and Doctors without Borders have undergone exponential growth in terms of mainstream media mentions. 
By this measure, the biggest NGO's have become established players in the battle for the attention of influential editors. 
Even large countries with hard power, such as the United States, are affected. 
The US, for example, initially had strong objections to the Convention on Tobacco Control, but dropped them in the face of international criticism. 
The Landmines Treaty was created despite the opposition of the strongest bureaucracy (the Pentagon) in the world's largest military power. 
Such campaigns sometimes succeed because they can credibly threaten to damage the value of global brand names. 
This decision came two years after the company acceded to pressure from environmentalists and scrapped plans to drill in a World Heritage site in Bangladesh. 
Transnational drug companies were shamed by NGO's into abandoning lawsuits in South Africa in 2002 over infringements of their patents on drugs to fight AIDS. 
Similar campaigns of naming and shaming have affected the investment and employment patterns of Mattel, Nike, and a host of other companies. 
NGO's vary enormously in their organization, budgets, accountability, and sense of responsibility for the accuracy of their claims. 
It is hyperbole when activists call such movements "the world's other superpower," yet governments ignore them at their peril. 
Some have reputations and credibility that give them impressive domestic as well as international soft power. 
Others lack credibility among moderate citizens but can mobilize demonstrations that demand the attention of governments. 
For better and for worse, NGO's and network organizations have resources and do not hesitate to use them. 
Do NGO's make world politics more democratic? 
Not in the traditional sense of the word. 
Most are elite organizations with narrow membership bases. 
Some act irresponsibly and with little accountability. 
In that sense, they serve as antidotes to traditional government bureaucracies. 
Non-governmental actors are changing world politics. 
After Abu Ghraib, even US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld must take notice. 
The Rising Wealth of Nations 
The new Penn World Table, Version 6.2, comparing standards of living across countries, has just been released. 
The latest figures are for 2004, and, because of data lags, not all countries are included. 
People generally are a lot better off than they were just a few years ago. 
At this rate, real per capita GDP will double every 16 years. 
Many people who could not afford a car in 2000 now have one, and people who could afford only one car in 2000 now have two. 
People who could not afford to send their children to a good school or college now can. 
And so it is with many different goods and services that people consume. 
One surprise is that there has been relatively little change in the ranking of countries by real per capita GDP since 2000. 
The range between the poorest and the richest countries in the world is a factor of more than 100. 
The average real per capita GDP of the top 25% of countries is 15 times that of the bottom 25%. 
Watching these countries progress is like watching a marathon. 
At first, one is impressed by most of the runners, almost all of whom seem to be going fast. 
As they pass by, all spread out, one sees that some runners seem to be gaining rapidly. 
And yet they do not often overtake one another, because the distances between them are so large. 
Indeed, other runners are out of sight, perhaps miles ahead. 
China isn’t the only success story. 
But the overall picture is amazingly good. 
But, of course, they will not have caught up with these countries, for those countries will have moved ahead too. 
It is hard to imagine now what that world will be like with a doubling or quadrupling of just about every country’s GDP. 
What would all these countries do with all that money? 
He wrote: “So great has been the change [in standards of living] that many of the desires of the individual are no longer even evident to him. 
But real per capita GDP in the US is now three times higher than it was in 1958. 
What have people been spending all that extra money on? 
Is it all dictated by advertisers and salesmen who are inventing needs? 
The kinds of things that advertisers and salesmen typically promote were relatively unimportant. 
Food got only 8% of the extra money, clothing only 3%, and personal care 1%. 
Unfortunately, idealistic activities also received little of the extra money: 3% for welfare and religious activities, and a similar share for education. 
That sounds like what really happened in the US. 
Maybe that is the way it will be around the world. 
As long as we can keep worldwide growth going at its current rate, billions of people can look forward to the same kind of improvement. 
And that should be truly inspirational. 
The Risk of European Centralization 
But major disagreements about how to achieve that goal remain. 
Historically, monetary union was regarded as the route to political union. 
More recently, German Chancellor Angela Merkel asserted that “if the euro fails, Europe will fail.” 
But the crisis confronting “Europe” is not so much about political union as it is about European Economic and Monetary Union. 
Politicians launched monetary union in 1999, despite warnings that the constituent economies were too diverse. 
It wasn’t long before several states violated the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Later, the eurozone’s “no bail-out” principle was abandoned. 
The fact that sovereign member states did not deliver on their European commitments is hardly a convincing argument for giving up sovereignty now. 
In short, all of the measures that would implicitly support political union have turned out to be inconsistent and dangerous. 
They have involved huge financial risks for eurozone members. 
They have fueled tensions among member states. 
Public support for “Europe” depends to a large degree on its economic success. 
Indeed, it is Europe’s economic achievements that give it a political voice in the world. 
But, as the current crisis indicates, the best-performing EU economies are those with (relatively) flexible labor markets, reasonable tax rates, and open access to professions and business. 
This approach – harmonization, coordination, and centralized decision-making – continues to be regarded as a panacea for Europe’s problems. 
It is the sort of pretense of knowledge that the economist Friedrich von Hayek denounced as a recipe for constraining freedom and ensuring economic mediocrity. 
There are plenty of areas in which common action at the EU level is both appropriate and efficient. 
Environmental policy is clearly one. 
But centralization of economic decision-making, as an end in itself, cannot underpin a prosperous and powerful Europe. 
Its current economic malaise reflects European leaders’ prolonged efforts to deny the obvious. 
Lending in the Dark 
HONG KONG – The proliferation of China’s opaque, loosely regulated (or unregulated) shadow-banking system has been raising fears of possible financial instability. 
But just how extensive – and how risky – is shadow banking in China? 
In 2007, the volume of shadow-banking transactions in the US exceeded that of conventional banking assets. 
Chinese shadow banking totals only about $2.2 trillion. 
It is ultimately funded through retail bank deposits, banks’ wealth-management products, and private equity. 
Thus, the real issue in China is not the volume of shadow credit, but its quality, and the banking system’s capacity to absorb potential losses. 
Market forces and policy conflicts triggered shadow banking’s emergence in China. 
Since 2008, shadow banking has exploded, owing to price and regulatory factors. 
China simply needs a better system for evaluating the quality of such credits (and for providing depositors with returns that can offset inflation). 
Chinese policymakers should view the shadow-banking scare as a market-driven opportunity to transform the banking system into an efficient, balanced, inclusive, and productive engine of growth. 
They should begin by reforming the property-rights regime to enable market forces to balance the supply and demand of savings and investments in a manner that maintains credit discipline and transparency. 
This requires, first and foremost, determining who – the investor or the bank – bears the underlying default risk of high-yield wealth-management products. 
Given that this is a legal question of contract definition and enforcement, it should be answered in the courts or arbitration tribunals, not by regulators. 
Furthermore, reducing local-government financing vehicles’ exposures is essential. 
China needs to build its municipal bond market to generate more sustainable funding for infrastructure projects. 
Local governments could then privatize the massive assets that they have accumulated during years of rapid growth, using the proceeds to pay down their debt. 
Reform efforts should be supported by measures – such as strict enforcement of balance-sheet transparency requirements – to improve risk management. 
In fact, the existing shadow-banking risks are manageable, given relatively robust GDP growth and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. 
Another ¥8 trillion are housing mortgages, which also carry little risk, given low loan-to-value ratios. 
Exposure to domestic sovereign obligations – by state-owned enterprises and local governments – accounts for about ¥32 trillion, and obligations by private firms amount to roughly ¥24 trillion. 
This breakdown suggests that the ¥8 trillion cushion would be sufficient to offset potential losses arising from higher-risk credit in China’s commercial banking sector. 
The high interest-rate margins set by the PBOC provide additional support. 
But, if more risk builds up through continued expansion of shadow credit, this risk buffer may become inadequate. 
Thus, Chinese policymakers must focus on curbing the shadow-banking sector’s growth, while ensuring that all current and future risks stemming from the system are laid bare. 
The introduction of measures to cool the property market, and new direct regulatory controls over shadow-banking credit, represent a step in the right direction. 
Perhaps the biggest challenges facing China are raising real returns on financial liabilities (deposits and wealth-management products) and promoting more balanced lending. 
Increased costs for investment in real assets would help to rein in property prices and reduce over-capacity in infrastructure and manufacturing. 
Ultimately, addressing shadow banking in China will require mechanisms that clearly define, allocate, and adjudicate financial risks among the key players. 
Such institutional reforms would go a long way toward eliminating default (or bailout) risk and creating a market-oriented financial system of balanced incentives that supports growth and innovation. 
The Risk Tsunami 
Yet there are several significant risks to global economic stability and prosperity that must be addressed urgently. 
With lower and more realistic growth forecasts, fiscal deficits in the short to medium term are viewed as more dangerous. 
In the US, a subset of policymakers believes that weakening growth and high unemployment require a policy response. 
It also assumes that addressing structural constraints on competitiveness can be deferred – perhaps permanently. 
Unilateral action in this and other dimensions has undercut the G-20’s mission of identifying and implementing mutually beneficial policies in a coordinated way. 
America needs to expand its share in external global demand, which requires public-sector investment, structural change, and improved competitiveness in the tradable sector. 
The emerging-market economies are at risk as a result. 
They must understand this. 
The old asymmetries are fading away, and there are new distributional challenges at the core of global economy-policy coordination. 
For most of the postwar period, advanced countries grew by expanding the knowledge and technology base of their economies. 
That pattern is changing. 
Emerging economies’ scale is growing, and their positioning on the global value chain is shifting rapidly. 
These almost certainly reflect divergences in terms of that system’s distributional impacts. 
Guiding global interdependence in a way that ameliorates negative distributional trends is possible, but it will require wisdom and insight. 
That challenge must be at the core of the G-20’s mission. 
To put it differently, recognizing our collective interest in the openness of the global economy is not sufficient. 
The alternative will be unilateral measures aimed at achieving the same goals, but leading to outcomes that leave everyone worse off. 
Ten QE Questions 
But questions about the effectiveness and risks of QE have begun to multiply as well. 
In particular, ten potential costs associated with such policies merit attention. 
So, somewhere between the Austrian and Keynesian extremes, QE needs to be phased out over time. 
Second, repeated QE may become ineffective over time as the channels of transmission to real economic activity become clogged. 
The bond channel doesn’t work when bond yields are already low; and the credit channel doesn’t work when banks hoard liquidity and velocity collapses. 
Moreover, the stock-market channel leading to asset reflation following QE works only in the short run if growth fails to recover. 
When that happens, QE becomes a zero-sum game, because not all currencies can fall, and not all trade balances can improve, simultaneously. 
The outcome, then, is “QE wars” as proxies for “currency wars.” 
Fourth, QE in advanced economies leads to excessive capital flows to emerging markets, which face a difficult policy challenge. 
Sterilized foreign-exchange intervention keeps domestic interest rates high and feeds the inflows. 
But unsterilized intervention and/or reducing domestic interest rates creates excessive liquidity that can feed domestic inflation and/or asset and credit bubbles. 
At the same time, forgoing intervention and allowing the currency to appreciate erodes external competitiveness, leading to dangerous external deficits. 
Yet imposing capital controls on inflows is difficult and sometimes leaky. 
Macroprudential controls on credit growth are useful, but sometimes ineffective in stopping asset bubbles when low interest rates continue to underpin generous liquidity conditions. 
Fifth, persistent QE can lead to asset bubbles both where it is implemented and in countries where it spills over. 
Sixth, QE can create moral-hazard problems by weakening governments’ incentive to pursue needed economic reforms. 
Seventh, exiting QE is tricky. 
If exit occurs too slowly and too late, inflation and/or asset/credit bubbles could result. 
Eighth, an extended period of negative real interest rates implies a redistribution of income and wealth from creditors and savers toward debtors and borrowers. 
Ninth, QE and other unconventional monetary policies can have serious unintended consequences. 
Finally, there is a risk of losing sight of any road back to conventional monetary policies. 
The US has moved from QE1 to QE2 and now to QE3, which is potentially unlimited and linked to an unemployment target. 
Officials are now actively discussing the merit of negative policy rates. 
And policymakers have moved to a risky credit-easing policy as QE’s effectiveness has waned. 
In short, policies are becoming more unconventional, not less, with little clarity about short-term effects, unintended consequences, and long-term impacts. 
To be sure, QE and other unconventional monetary policies do have important short-term benefits. 
But if such policies remain in place for too long, their side effects could be severe – and the longer-term costs very high. 
Asia’s Rebalancing Act 
SEOUL – Rapid economic growth in China undoubtedly benefits the rest of Asia. 
Indeed, strong Chinese demand has supported its trading partners’ export-led growth for much of the past three decades. 
Some, indeed, now predict a Chinese banking or fiscal disaster; others predict long-term stagnation equivalent to Japan’s lost decades. 
These “hard landing” scenarios are extreme. 
But the road ahead is bumpy and uncertain. 
No one can guarantee that Prime Minister Li Keqiang’s attempts to achieve deleveraging and structural reform will succeed. 
Moreover, external shocks, policy mistakes, and political instability could disrupt even the best-laid plans. 
In any case, China’s stellar growth record cannot be sustained. 
Even if it manages a “soft landing,” annual output growth will slow to 5-6% in the coming decades. 
In China, labor inputs have fallen as a result of declining fertility and an aging population. 
Reduced rates of return will lower investment rates. 
China’s inevitable growth slowdown, along with a large tail risk, threatens stable growth in Asian economies that have become increasingly interdependent. 
Trade within Asia now accounts for more than half of the continent’s total trade turnover. 
Moreover, direct investment and financial flows contribute further to economic interdependence. 
The rise in intra-Asian trade reflects China’s central role in East Asia’s production networks. 
As a result, China has become South Korea’s single largest export market, and Japan’s second largest. 
It is also the largest trading partner of all ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
In terms of investment, the International Monetary Fund predicts that a disruption in China’s investment boom will adversely affect its trading partners. 
A drop of one percentage point in China’s investment rate is estimated to reduce Taiwan’s GDP growth rate by 0.9 percentage points and Korea’s by 0.6 percentage points. 
If China can successfully rebalance its economy and shift to consumption-based growth, its trading partners could benefit enormously from a huge retail market. 
But as long as China’s import share of final consumption remains low, direct gains for exporters of consumer goods are likely to be small. 
In other words, sustainable growth requires all of Asia’s China-dependent economies to rebalance their two main growth engines. 
To enhance domestic demand, Asia, including China, must reallocate resources and structurally transform the economy. 
Reinforcing social safety nets, broadening and deepening financial markets, and supporting small and medium-size enterprises would also strengthen domestic demand. 
Likewise, service-sector liberalization will be essential to promoting productivity and creating jobs. 
In short, implementation of fiscal, financial, and structural reforms can mitigate the spillover effects from China’s slowdown. 
But a second reform front, aimed at enhancing regional coordination, must also be opened. 
With economic shocks able to spread more quickly than ever before, owing to broadened trade and financial channels, all Asian countries must maintain a sound macroeconomic environment. 
Asian countries must be able to conduct well-coordinated candid reviews of one another to reduce the likelihood of risks and detect emerging vulnerabilities. 
China’s long-term growth potential – and that of the rest of developing Asia – is not pre-defined. 
Brave New Cells? 
Supporters of such research are framing criticism of it as opposition to saving children’s lives and an impediment to scientific development. 
But this view neglects a crucial factor in the debate: the techniques being developed involve permanent genetic alterations passed on to future generations. 
This results in embryos that contain genetic material from three people – the child’s father and mother, plus the egg donor. 
Despite the good intentions behind mitochondrial research, international concern about the implications of breaching this barrier is mounting. 
Mitochondrial mutations can have serious consequences, including epilepsy, liver failure, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy. 
But they managed to develop only 8% of the zygotes to a slightly later stage. 
But “treatment” does not mean helping existing sufferers. 
Unlike eugenicists, proponents of altering mitochondrial DNA simply hope to free future generations from deadly diseases. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the slippery slope. 
But the more urgent threat is that any kind of germline genetic modification could do long-term, permanent damage. 
The HFEA’s own expert panel reported that the safety of mitochondrial techniques is far from being proven for current users. 
There is no telling what it could mean for their descendants. 
In fact, mitochondrial studies have already begun to produce unexpected results. 
For example, scientists in Oregon recently observed abnormal fertilization in some of the human eggs that they had manipulated. 
Like all human endeavors, science gets some things wrong. 
Germline genetic modification threatens to make such errors permanent. 
The UK scientific and charitable organizations advocating mitochondrial research are proud of the permissive legislative framework that has enabled them to establish an “international lead.” 
But extending that leniency to human germline genetic modification may well cause future generations to view their actions very differently. 
The Risky Rich 
NEW YORK – Today’s swollen fiscal deficits and public debt are fueling concerns about sovereign risk in many advanced economies. 
Traditionally, sovereign risk has been concentrated in emerging-market economies. 
As a result, sovereign risk today is a greater problem in advanced economies than in most emerging-market economies. 
Fiscal stimulus is a tricky business. 
Policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. 
But if monetized fiscal deficits are allowed to run, the increase in long-term yields will put a chokehold on growth. 
While that could be contractionary, the gain in fiscal-policy credibility might prevent a damaging spike in long-term government-bond yields. 
So early fiscal consolidation can be expansionary on balance. 
These countries had already lost export-market shares to China and other low value-added and labor-intensive Asian economies. 
Then a decade of nominal-wage growth that out-paced productivity gains led to a rise in unit labor costs, real exchange-rate appreciation, and large current-account deficits. 
Countries like Latvia and Hungary have shown a willingness to do so. 
Whether Greece, Spain, and other euro-zone members will accept such wrenching adjustments remains to be seen. 
Japan is a net creditor and largely finances its debt domestically. 
But investors will become increasingly cautious even about these countries if the necessary fiscal consolidation is delayed. 
Japan is aging even faster, and economic stagnation is reducing domestic savings, while the public debt is approaching 200% of GDP. 
At least European voters are willing to pay higher taxes for their public services. 
If America’s Democrats lose in the mid-term elections this November, there is a risk of persistent fiscal deficits as Republicans veto tax increases while Democrats veto spending cuts. 
A disorderly rush to the exit could lead to a dollar collapse, a spike in long-term interest rates, and a severe double dip recession. 
The Road Ahead in the Middle East 
For a significant number of both Palestinians and Israelis, the use of force has come to represent the only conceivable option. 
Palestinian society can feel very little hope in the immediate term, so what else is there to lose? 
Political and media support ought to focus on programs that work on the ground, as reported by humanitarian and non-governmental agencies, and not on particular religious agendas. 
Islam as a religion of peace and human betterment is betrayed by anyone who commits atrocities in its name. 
It is a broad and inclusive religion whose adherents across the world presently suffer from their lack of a unified voice. 
Such a step would bring to non-Muslims some of the sharpest thinking in the Islamic world, and would contribute a missing voice to debates about global values. 
The goal today must be to modernize each tradition, while remaining faithful to its roots. 
A total collapse of religious norms would truly be destabilizing. 
In the Middle East, clear ethical leadership is needed. 
But such leadership cannot achieve results in a vacuum. 
Global standards of behavior can only be implemented effectively if they are upheld by all. 
The developed world has an obligation to live up to the standards of the Declaration of Human Rights and other documents describing universal norms. 
One of the most important expressions of goodwill is the gift of humanitarian aid. 
Yet humanitarian aid must not become just another foreign policy tool. 
There should be a re-evaluation of the place of altruism and compliance with universal humanitarian norms. 
The Road from Crony Capitalism 
It is no surprise that the results of so simplistic a policy prescription were often illiberal democracy and crony capitalism. 
That consensus remains important, but it is insufficient for success. 
Building effective institutions is equally important. 
For illiberal democracy and crony capitalism flourish where the institutional framework is lacking or corrupted. 
Both have the same poisoned roots, so it is not surprising that they go hand in hand. 
Crony capitalism is a system that gives free rein to phenomena such as hidden connections between political and economic power, corruption, clientelism, and embezzlement. 
As it takes hold, the fairness of the political process shrivels. 
Can this vicious circle - which is not just a theoretical threat but an unfortunate reality in many countries - be broken? 
In the postcommunist democracies, however, these informal societal values and principles are only dimly perceived, if they are perceived at all, by a majority of the population. 
In this regard, history's heritage in Central Europe is extraordinarily tangled. 
Patterns from that seesawing past inevitably influence the present. 
In other municipalities and regions the majority continued to support authoritarian parties and reject classic liberal principles, under both liberal and illiberal regimes. 
Is it possible to break the cycle of illiberal democracy and crony capitalism? 
Slovakia offers a positive example of such a rupture. 
The 1998 elections that saw the defeat of Vladimir Meciar's regime clearly demonstrated that a break can be made. 
Six factors played a key role here: 
-- a change of generations; 
-- improved education; 
-- availability of information; 
-- a unified opposition respecting classic liberal values; 
-- growth in the influence of civil society. 
Many of these forces for change grew in direct opposition to Meciar's misrule. 
They are also needed if reform in the countries of Central Europe is to be accelerated. 
Developed countries and international institutions should focus their attention and support on nourishing their growth. 
The Road from Depression 
NEW YORK – Financial markets are driving the world towards another Great Depression with incalculable political consequences. 
The authorities, particularly in Europe, have lost control of the situation. 
They need to regain control, and they need to do so now. 
Three bold steps are needed. 
First, the governments of the eurozone must agree in principle on a new treaty creating a common treasury for the eurozone. 
Third, the ECB would enable countries such as Italy and Spain temporarily to refinance their debt at a very low cost. 
These steps would calm the markets and give Europe time to develop a growth strategy without which the debt problem cannot be solved. 
The immediate task is to erect the necessary safeguards against contagion from a possible Greek default. 
Two vulnerable groups – the banks and the government bonds of countries like Italy and Spain – need to be protected. 
To accomplish these related tasks, the EFSF would be used primarily to guarantee and recapitalize the banks. 
Systemically important banks would have to agree with the EFSF to abide by the ECB’s instructions as long as the guarantees are in force. 
Banks that refuse would not be guaranteed, but enough would agree to provide the ECB with the required critical mass. 
The ECB would then instruct the banks to maintain their credit lines and loan portfolios while closely monitoring the risks they run for their own accounts. 
These arrangements would stop the concentrated deleveraging that is one of the main causes of the crisis. 
Completing the recapitalization would remove the incentive to deleverage, at which point the blanket guarantee can be withdrawn. 
To relieve the pressure on the government bonds of countries like Italy, the ECB would lower its discount rate. 
It would then encourage the countries concerned to finance themselves entirely by issuing treasury bills – and encourage the banks to buy them. 
The banks could rediscount the bills with the ECB, but they would not do so as long as they earned more on the bills than on the cash. 
These measures would allow Greece to default without causing a global meltdown – which does not mean that Greece would be forced into default. 
If Greece met its targets, the EFSF could underwrite a “voluntary” restructuring at, say, 50 cents on the euro. 
How Greece fared under these circumstances would be up to the Greeks. 
How to create viable fiscal rules for the euro would be left to the treaty negotiations. 
Most of these proposals seek to leverage the EFSF by turning it into a bank, an insurance company, or a special-purpose vehicle that takes the riskier tranche of a public-private partnership. 
That said, some form of leverage could be used in recapitalizing the banks. 
The course of action outlined here does not require leveraging or increasing the size of the EFSF. 
But it is more radical, because it puts the banks under European control. 
That is liable to arouse the opposition of both the banks and national authorities – opposition that only public pressure can overcome. 
The Road Map Includes Damascus 
Powerful countries know that it is dangerous to be seen to flinch, because enemies take heart and allies’ knees begin to knock. 
A great power also knows that if it sets out on a military adventure without setting achievable goals, it can get into bad trouble. 
But the Lebanon war’s failure may yet provide an opening to peace if Israel is bold enough to seize it. 
The two issues have long been connected, but the main link is now President Bashar Al-Assad’s Syria. 
Isolated, desperate for allies, Syria has been helping Iran in its quest for regional hegemony. 
Since Lebanon’s Cedar Revolution evicted Syria last year, the Syrians have sought to haul Lebanon back within their sphere of influence. 
They back Hezbollah – and help Iran send it weapons – because Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah’s shock troops keep the government in Beirut weak. 
The Syrians also like to present themselves as the last real Arab defenders of the Palestinian cause. 
Syria’s position and interests should make it amenable to a deal. 
Of course, Syria still believes in a “Greater Syria” and never fully accepted Lebanon’s sovereignty. 
Many of the Hezbollah rockets that rained on Israel bore the markings of Syria’s Defence Ministry. 
Yet Syria has one redeeming feature: it is a secular country that traditionally recoils from Islamic fundamentalism. 
Indeed, President Hafez Al-Assad, Bashar’s father, massacred up to 38,000 mainly Sunni fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood insurgents in Hama in 1982. 
Today, parts of the ruling Ba’ath elite worry about Syria’s deepening alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah. 
That alliance reflects fear, not commitment. 
Both Syria’s reluctant alliance with Iran, and its economic desperation, provide openings that Israel and the West should test. 
But what might Syria want? 
Like his father, Assad is cautious. 
The big puzzle is what Assad wants with Lebanon. 
If his aim is a government in Beirut that takes into account Syria’s genuine security concerns, Israel can live with that. 
Israel now faces three options. 
It can flinch while pretending not to; it can carry on more or less as before, hoping for some positive new development; or it can try to decouple Syria from Iran and Hezbollah. 
The latter option is the only scenario that could stop the Islamist drift in the Middle East. 
But prying Syria from Iran’s embrace means, eventually, reopening the Golan Heights question. 
A deal with Syria is not impossible, given the ambiguities in Assad’s position. 
On the Israeli/American side, it would include recognition that Syria has security interests in Lebanon. 
For Syria, a peace deal would also include an understanding that Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights is to be settled by serious negotiation, not war. 
Such a diplomatic opening may be hard for Israel’s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, to accept, let alone to sell to Israelis. 
So America and Europe must help him reach this conclusion. 
America and Israel must drop their refusal to talk to Syria. 
Israel would gain much by talking to its enemy. 
Removing Syria as a threat is a key element in achieving this strategic objective. 
The Road to Arab Democracy 
Instead, it wrought for France – and much of Europe – Jacobin terror, right-wing counter-terror, decades of war, and eventually Napoleonic tyranny. 
A similar challenge now faces North Africa and the Middle East, where most Arab countries are experiencing massive upheavals. 
Historically speaking, what is now happening is without precedent in the Arab world. 
For the first time, Arab authoritarian regimes have been toppled, and others are threatened, by mass demonstrations calling for freedom and democracy. 
Previously, Arab regimes changed through military coups and other sorts of putsches, never through popular revolutions. 
Now, however, the region’s political inertia has been disrupted. 
Cairo’s Tahrir Square has become a symbol for both hope and “people power.” 
Theirs were relatively “soft” autocracies. 
Even in tiny Bahrain, the Sunni minority has, for now, succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority, albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries. 
As always, it is easier to bring down an autocracy than to construct and consolidate a democratic regime. 
Today, they are very different from each other. 
Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary, for example, succeeded in navigating a successful transition to democracy and a functioning market economy. 
Russia reverted to a neo-authoritarian system. 
The former Soviet republics in Central Asia have all developed various “sultanistic” forms of government. 
Yet, even in Egypt, the challenges are enormous. 
One hears about a possible modus vivendi between the army and the Muslim Brotherhood. 
Indeed, some activists are already back in Tahrir Square demonstrating against such an incongruous yet possible alliance. 
In Libya, if Qaddafi falls, can such a highly tribalized country possess the building blocks needed for a functioning democracy? 
Yet Christian Democratic parties today are one of the pillars of European democracy. 
Like Christian churches, Islam can also change, and Indonesia and Turkey could well be examples for such a possibility. 
How will all of this influence the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which appears stuck? 
It may be difficult to know, especially as the fundamentalist Hamas, now in control of Gaza, might be encouraged by the rising power of its parent organization in Egypt. 
The recent escalation of violence along Gaza’s border with Israel does suggest that events are developing in a dangerous direction. 
As for Israel, it initially responded to the Arab revolts in a confused way. 
Whatever happens in Libya will have repercussions across the region. 
The Road to Depression 
They have also had three subsidiary objectives: 
• Prevent the princes of Wall Street who led us into the crisis from profiting from the systemic risk that they created. 
Now it is clear that the Fed and the Treasury have lost the game. 
If a depression is to be avoided, it will have to be the work of other arms of the government, with other tools and powers. 
The shareholders of Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac essentially had ownership positions and all their wealth confiscated for pennies. 
But this was not true of bondholders and counterparties, who were paid in full. 
That, the Fed and the Treasury believed, could not be healthy. 
Lenders to very large overleveraged institutions had to have some incentive to calculate the risks. 
In retrospect, this was a major mistake. 
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy created an extraordinary and immediate demand for additional bank capital, which the private sector could not supply. 
It was at this point that the Treasury made the second mistake. 
But would that have been worse than what we face now? 
Of course, hindsight is always easy. 
The Road to Fiscal Crisis 
This view is seriously flawed. 
By 2050, there will undoubtedly be a fiscal problem – but, again, there is plenty of time to ignore it. 
This week, such government debt paid around 3.2%, which is very low by historical standards. 
If the “Washington Fiscal Consensus” proves correct, when benchmark rates eventually edge upwards, they will move slowly. 
People sometimes talk about “systemic risk” as if it were intrinsic to the financial system. But modern financial history, including in emerging markets, strongly indicates otherwise. 
When banks and other financial institutions get into trouble, private losses are transferred – explicitly or implicitly – to the government’s balance sheet. Dangerous financial systems pose big fiscal risks. 
The three people who have articulated this problem most clearly include two of the world’s leading central bankers. 
The insight of Admati and her collaborators is simple and very powerful. 
Mervyn King, a former academic who is currently Governor of the Bank of England, and his colleagues have a vivid name for the toxic cocktail that results: “doom loop.” 
This limits losses to stockholders and completely protects almost all creditors. 
As a result, banks have even stronger incentives to resume heavy borrowing (as Admati argues), and, as rising asset prices lift the economy in the recovery phase, it becomes possible for them to borrow even more (as Bernanke knows). But what this really amounts to is taking on more risk, typically in an unregulated, unsupervised way – and with very little effective governance within the banks themselves (again, Admati explains why bank executives like it this way). 
The Bernanke-Admati-King view suggests that the Washington Fiscal Consensus is seriously deficient. 
America’s too-big-to-fail banks are well on their way to becoming too big to save. 
That point will be reached when saving the big banks, protecting their creditors, and stabilizing the economy plunges the US government so deeply into debt that its solvency is called into question, interest rates rise sharply, and a fiscal crisis erupts. 
In other words, the “doom loop” isn’t really a loop at all. 
It does end eventually, as it has – just for starters – in Iceland, Ireland, and Greece. 
The Road to Justice in Iraq 
As questions continue to mount concerning the true rationale behind the Iraq war, we should avoid only looking backwards. 
Today, the domestic security vacuum in Iraq is so profound that it calls into question whether the war is really over. 
Guerrilla attacks on coalition soldiers show that no neat line separates ``before'' and ``after.'' 
So does the disturbing continuity between the absence of legality prior to the occupation and now, under the formal authority of the occupying powers. 
After all, it is the rule of law--and only the rule of law--that distinguishes free societies from dictatorships. 
Coalition military officials recognize the obvious: without proof of Saddam Hussein's demise, resistance by his hardcore supporters would inevitably continue. 
But what about the need for a wider reckoning with the former regime? 
So far, security and law enforcement have been utterly inadequate to deal with past abuses. 
Given decades of repressive rule, and tens of thousands of disappeared Iraqis, there are already endemic problems of verification. 
But from the outset of the intervention, coalition officials have displayed patent disregard for mass graves and massacre sites. 
These efforts will succeed only if they include a modicum of transitional justice. 
As the occupation force in Iraq, the coalition has undertaken international obligations, under the fourth Geneva convention, to uphold security and the rule of law. 
This means that the coalition cannot do whatever it wishes with Saddam's henchmen and war criminals. 
It cannot simply ship them to Guantanamo Bay or Diego Garcia. 
But the coalition's choices are extremely limited. 
Similarly, the coalition would inevitably face the charge of ``victor's justice'' were it to administer and staff its own courts. 
Only the UN can meet the demand for transitional justice. 
This requires the immediate establishment of a judicial body, whose legitimacy would be based on the same multilateral process that was sought prior to the war. 
As a result, the UN Iraqi court's jurisdiction would extend only to the gravest violations of humanitarian law, on which there is a broad consensus, as set forth in Article 3 of the charter of the International Criminal Court. 
But even such limited action is better than doing nothing. 
We know from the many cases of regime change in recent decades that the problem of transitional justice will not merely go away if ignored. 
One of the main purposes of pursuing transitional justice is to reestablish legitimacy and the rule of law in the present. 
If the necessary institutions remain unavailable, then at the least an investigative commission should be created to establish an evidentiary record while this is still possible. 
Such a commission would afford a measure of preservative justice, enabling a more comprehensive verdict once the institutional capacity for achieving this is built. 
But the path lies before us, not behind us, in a sustained commitment to security, the rule of law, and transitional justice. 
The Road to Nuclear Disarmament 
One of my priorities as United Nations Secretary-General is to promote global public goods and remedies to challenges that do not respect borders. 
A world free of nuclear weapons is a global public good of the highest order. 
My interest in this subject stems partly from personal experience. 
My homeland, South Korea, has suffered the ravages of conventional war and faced threats from nuclear weapons and other WMD. 
But, of course, such threats are not unique to Asia. 
Despite a longstanding taboo against using nuclear weapons, disarmament remains only an aspiration. 
So, is a taboo merely on the use of such weapons sufficient? 
States make the key decisions where nuclear weapons are concerned. 
But the UN has important roles to play. 
We provide a central forum in which states can agree on norms to serve their common interests. 
We analyze, educate, and advocate in the pursuit of agreed goals. 
Yet some states view such weapons as a status symbol, and some view them as offering the ultimate deterrent against nuclear attack, which largely accounts for the estimated 26,000 that still exist. 
There are also concerns that a “nuclear renaissance” is looming, with nuclear energy seen as a clean energy alternative at a time of intensifying efforts to combat climate change. 
The main worry is that this will lead to the production and use of more nuclear materials that must be protected against proliferation and terrorist threats. 
The obstacles to disarmament are formidable. 
But the costs and risks of its alternatives never get the attention they deserve. 
Consider the enormous opportunity cost of huge military budgets. 
Ten years ago, the Brookings Institution published a study that estimated the total costs of nuclear weapons in the United States alone to be over $5.8 trillion, including future cleanup costs. 
Concerns over nuclear weapons’ costs and inherent dangers have led to a global outpouring of ideas to breathe new life into nuclear disarmament. 
We have seen the WMD Commission led by Hans Blix, the New Agenda Coalition, and Norway’s Seven Nation Initiative. 
Australia and Japan have launched the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. 
Civil society groups and nuclear-weapon states have also made proposals, such as the Hoover Plan, spearheaded by Henry Kissinger. 
First, I urge all NPT parties, in particular the nuclear-weapon states, to fulfill their obligation under the treaty to undertake negotiations on effective measures leading to nuclear disarmament. 
They could agree on a framework of separate, mutually reinforcing instruments. 
Or they could consider negotiating a nuclear-weapons convention, backed by a strong verification system, as has long been proposed at the UN. 
The nuclear powers should actively engage with other states on this issue at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. 
The world would also welcome a resumption of bilateral negotiations between the US and Russia aimed at deep and verifiable reductions of their arsenals. 
Governments should also invest more in verification research and development. 
The United Kingdom’s proposal to host a conference of nuclear-weapon states on verification is a concrete step in the right direction. 
Second, the Security Council’s permanent members should begin discussions on security issues in the nuclear disarmament process. 
They could unambiguously assure non-nuclear-weapon states that they will not be subject to the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons. 
The Council could also convene a summit on nuclear disarmament. 
Non-NPT states should freeze their own nuclear-weapon capabilities and make their own disarmament commitments. 
We need new efforts to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into force, and for the Conference on Disarmament to begin negotiations on a fissile material treaty immediately, without preconditions. 
I support the creation of the Central Asian and African nuclear-weapon-free zones, and strongly support efforts to establish such a zone in the Middle East. 
And I urge all NPT parties to conclude their safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and voluntarily to adopt the strengthened safeguards under the Additional Protocol. 
Fourth, the nuclear-weapon states often circulate descriptions of what they are doing to pursue these goals. 
But these accounts seldom reach the public. 
I invite the nuclear-weapon states to send such material to the UN Secretariat, and to encourage its wider dissemination. 
The lack of an authoritative estimate of the total number of nuclear weapons attests to the need for greater transparency. 
These include eliminating other types of WMD; new efforts against WMD terrorism; limits on the production and trade in conventional arms; and new weapons bans, including of missiles and space weapons. 
If there is real, verified progress on disarmament, the ability to eliminate the nuclear threat will grow exponentially. 
As we progressively eliminate the world’s deadliest weapons and their components, we will make it harder to execute WMD terrorist attacks. 
The Road to Post-Crisis Growth 
Although recovery in advanced countries remains fragile, developing countries appear to have weathered the storm. 
Reasons for this remarkable resilience abound, and they offer guidance for advanced and developing countries alike. 
As the crisis struck, capital flowed out of developing countries to shore up damaged balance sheets in advanced countries. 
Credit tightened sharply. 
But rapid responses by developing-country central banks, in collaboration with relatively healthy domestic banks, prevented a severe credit freeze. 
Moreover, the reserves built up over the preceding decade were, in many cases, used to offset some of the capital outflows. 
Leverage was lower in several sectors. 
Financial institutions – and, more importantly, households – held less debt relative to assets and income. 
Both factors were more muted in developing economies. 
In sum, the crisis originated in a balance-sheet shock, to which exposure was simply lower in developing countries. 
All developing countries witnessed a huge fall-off in trade – much larger than the declines in income and output. 
Trade bounced back relatively quickly in the second half of 2009, though this partly reflected the extraordinarily low base. 
But the immediate effect was mitigated to some extent by a sharp depreciation of almost all the currencies caused by the capital outflows. 
The exception was China, where the renminbi held steady against the dollar, causing an initial appreciation against almost every other currency. 
That configuration has largely reversed in the past nine months as international capital flows, driven by investment opportunities and returns, return to a more normal pattern. 
It is likely that China will shortly resume its pre-crisis policy of managed appreciation. 
To be sure, developing countries differed – often markedly – in their capacity for fiscal stimulus to counter the loss of external demand. 
Nevertheless, many were capable of at least some countercyclical measures without destabilizing their public finances. 
In the meantime, a somewhat conservative and defensive posture is warranted. 
This means that developing countries are likely to retain substantial domestic ownership of their domestic financial institutions. 
Complex securities that are hard to value will be sharply limited as a matter of policy. 
In any case, limiting financial interdependence is the prudent strategy and the likely outcome. 
Nevertheless, the basic pillar of sustained high growth has been leveraging the global economy’s knowledge and demand. 
That remains valid. 
Indeed, worries about rising protectionism in a low-growth environment are on target. 
Those developing countries that maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, a countercyclical mindset, and steady progress on governance, education, and infrastructure will thrive. 
Developing countries’ internal trade is expanding with their economic size, and the large ones are restoring growth rapidly. 
The Road to Post-War Recovery 
The problems of war-ravaged countries are far more acute and their choices much more constrained. 
Indeed, they confront a double challenge: to create dynamic economies and to promote, at the same time, economic and social inclusion. 
Without both of these elements, national reconciliation will likely prove impossible. 
Social exclusion in industrial countries imposes costs throughout society that policymakers must address with effective and targeted measures. 
Lack of jobs, for example, often leads people, particularly the young, away from work and into dependency on drugs and crime. 
Society, then , needs to pay for the costs of crime prevention policies and the administration of justice. 
A flexible labor market, as many suggest, will not in itself promote inclusion. 
Welfare programs in war-ravaged countries often aggravate joblessness by reducing work incentives and creating a culture of dependency. 
Minimum-wage laws and labor agreements often make the least productive workers unaffordable to law-abiding employers. 
So what these countries need are more employment opportunities and higher salaries in the private sector for these workers. 
Specifically, a wage subsidy program that lowers the cost of hiring full-time unskilled workers could make it more attractive for firms to hire them. 
At the same time, on-the-job training would make the program attractive to workers and to society as a whole. 
In countries coming out of war or other conflicts, efforts at inclusion are futile in stagnant economies. 
Thus, post-war transitions require that policies that encourage dynamism and inclusion go hand in hand. 
Policymaking in these war torn economies is unique. 
Most countries in post-conflict situations suffer from weak fiscal positions, rendering the provision of internally financed subsidies impractical in most cases. 
Typically, however, this type of aid declines very rapidly. 
Low-income countries in the normal process of development, for example, receive steady inflows of official foreign assistance of about 3% of their gross national income. 
By contrast, aid reached 95% of gross national income in Rwanda soon after the conflict ended, but fell to 20% within five years. 
Hence, effective financing for peacetime is a good investment of donors’ resources and a major factor in conflict prevention. 
But donors need to avoid some common mistakes. 
In many cases, economic reconstruction has failed partly because donors required that their own nationals or companies be used. 
Given lower labor costs, local businessmen could decide to invest under the conditions of uncertainty and high risk that characterize post-conflict situations. 
This type of aid would also provide political support for the authorities from a population grateful for policies that promote job creation. 
Grant-supported subsidies would remain in place for a finite period, and donors would gradually phase them out as aid programs expire. 
The Road to Prosperity and Sound Markets 
Some recommendations by members of Columbia University’s Center on Capitalism and Society were sent to last April’s G20 meeting. 
I also renewed my support for a subsidy to companies for their ongoing employment of low-wage workers. 
(Singapore adopted this idea with enviable results.) 
Amar Bhide suggested that commercial banks return to “narrow banking.” 
If they did that, they could not borrow at all. 
But despite all the policy action and talk since then, none of these suggestions has been adopted by G20 countries. 
Their emphasis has been on countercyclical measures intended to moderate the downturn rather than on restructuring. 
Such moderation, taken alone, is welcome, of course. 
But the measures taken may be delaying recovery. 
Much of the stimulus to homeowners is propping up housing prices at unsustainable levels. 
This is slowing the absorption into the economy of the excess resources in the construction industry. 
Another round of global stimulus after the downturn is over or nearly so would push world interest rates up and drive investment activity down. 
But as a means to job creation there are questions. 
Private investment is sustained by private innovation, which renews good opportunities. 
But would good opportunities for state investment be similarly renewed? 
Might the uncertainties raised by entering into such unknown territory exact a serious toll on private investment activity? 
Governments must shake off the delusion that full recovery is just a matter of pushing buttons. 
What governments ought to do is “stimulate” an innovative economy, not endless roads, wind energy and other building projects. 
The best way to shorten the downturn is to restructure the economy in such ways that it recovers to a higher “new normal” level. 
The meeting is intended to seek ways to streamline and buttress complex and stumbling economies so that they possess the dynamism that delivers high prosperity – plentiful jobs and ample job satisfaction. 
Not all the instruments for creating that prosperity are known, of course. 
It is good to have a banking industry run by a diversity of canny financiers capable of recognizing and willing to fund innovative investment projects. 
It is good to have a business sector in which shareowners are not prey to self-dealing CEOs. 
It is bad to have fund managers that dump a company’s shares if it does not hit its earnings targets for the next quarter. 
Markets, being peopled by mere human beings, have trouble figuring out where profitable investment opportunities are (let alone the most profitable). 
A company’s knowledge of the future results of a new business undertaking is imperfect to say the least. 
And the more innovative the undertaking the more imperfect is any advance understanding of its potential outcome. 
Moreover, what others think – particularly, what rivals are doing – may have a big effect on the results of a decision and much of what others understand and plan is private, thus inaccessible. 
Those of us who, at the Berlin conference and elsewhere, seek to rebuild economies for greater dynamism must do so with awareness of these economic realities. 
Fortunately, there are some policy precepts and ideas that governments would do well to invest their political capital in if they want innovation and its attendant prosperity to resume. 
A time-honored precept is to avoid shaking investor confidence unnecessarily. 
Yet governments must also avoid pumping up businesses with over-confidence, which could tempt them to raise mark-ups and hurt sales. 
Simplifying financial institutions, especially those with an implicit government backstop, must also play a role in rebuilding a dynamic economy. 
Hedge funds, venture capital firms that actually venture into new things, and recreated merchant banks are relatively well suited to make financial decisions that require judgment, the ability to engage the unknown, and to do so over a horizon not dictated by quarterly earnings. 
There are also ideas to address speculative swings. 
They may induce wasteful investment and a loss in innovation. 
But it makes the case for novel measures, including “guidance ranges” for asset prices and targeted variation of margin and capital requirements, to help dampen such excessive price movements. 
Regaining a well-functioning capitalism may be a steep mountain to climb. 
The Road to the Double Helix, the Structure of DNA 
Fifty years ago, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine Nature . 
It described a remarkable two-chain helical structure for DNA--the genetic material in living organisms. 
Their double-helix model provided the key to understanding how living cells can produce two exact copies of themselves and how genetic material stores all the information for synthesizing the proteins needed to build a living organism. 
A second major advance came a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin. 
Since then, X-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has helped us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions. 
Both discoveries--DNA structure and protein structure--were made at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory. 
So why were these two foundation stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of the 20th century uncovered in a British physics lab? 
The great breakthroughs of 1953 rested on the strength of experimental physics at Cambridge, beginning in the late 19th century. 
William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884, and became professor of physics in Adelaide, Australia. 
In 1909 he returned to Britain to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays. 
Astbury, meanwhile, moved to Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins. 
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) obtained patterns of the dry crystals, as Astbury had, and with similarly disappointing results. 
The results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published as a letter in Nature in 1934. 
Having deduced the presence of polypeptide chains, Astbury continued to pursue his pioneering studies of their configurations in fibrous proteins. 
He also obtained the first X-ray patterns of partially oriented samples of DNA. 
Max Perutz, a chemistry graduate from Vienna, arrived in Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal. 
The next year, he was given excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best X-ray diffraction patterns to date. 
But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work. 
So despite the enormous amount of excellent data that was collected, the solution remained tantalizingly out of reach. 
But the faith remained that detailed information about protein structure could be obtained from the X-ray patterns in some way, if only it could be discovered. 
The Road to Tripoli 
The two groups are drawn from a cross-section of society. 
Some members held senior posts in Qaddafi’s government; others were social activists. 
Both groups are now quite popular among the population in rebel-controlled parts of Libya. 
A military impasse could erode their support and even delegitimize them. 
When forming the councils, the opposition sought to achieve a balance between government experience, technical expertise, and tribal support. 
And powerful clans from Tobruk have succeeded in placing their members in key military positions. 
The councils are, moreover, largely a regional affair, with members mostly coming from eastern Libya. 
TNC officials admit that some council members are based in western Libya, but have refused to identify them for security reasons. 
Bolstered by his high profile as Justice Minister, Jalil has emerged as an interim leader. 
On the military side, simmering tensions between two officers are frustrating combat strategy. 
Such political and military spats are likely to continue as officials attempt to consolidate their positions. 
The two groups are hard-pressed to formulate a clear political and social platform. 
“Anyone but Qaddafi,” one man in Tobruk told me. 
But support for the TNC is largely skin deep – it is neither grounded in knowledge of how the opaque council functions, nor based on an understanding of its goals. 
To ensure that the rebels have a fighting chance against Qaddafi’s better-equipped troops, Western countries will have to move beyond air strikes and offering the TNC diplomatic recognition. 
They will need to provide medium-range rockets and light armored vehicles to anti-regime forces, in addition to training them to use their weapons properly. 
The Rocky Road to Recovery 
I always thought that the notion that what happened in America would be decoupled from the rest of the world was a myth. 
Events are showing that to be so. 
This, together with concerted action by governments elsewhere, will mean that the downturn will be less severe than it otherwise would be. 
By now, the dynamics of the downturn are set, and things will get worse before they get better. 
The response to the lack of liquidity is ever more liquidity. 
Will America face a bout of inflation? 
Or, more likely, in another moment of excess, will the Fed over-react, nipping the recovery in the bud? 
Given the unsteady hand exhibited so far, we cannot have much confidence in what awaits us. 
For a long time, the US has played an important role in keeping the global economy going. 
America’s profligacy – the fact that the world’s richest country could not live within its means – was often criticized. 
But perhaps the world should be thankful, because without American profligacy, there would have been insufficient global aggregate demand. 
In the past, developing countries filled this role, running trade and fiscal deficits. 
But they paid a high price, and fiscal responsibility and conservative monetary policies are now the fashion. 
Money put into reserves is income not spent. 
The world’s unending appetite for oil, beyond its ability or willingness to produce, has contributed a third factor. 
Rising oil prices transferred money to oil-rich countries, again contributing to the flood of liquidity. 
Though oil prices have been dampened for now, a robust recovery could send them soaring again. 
For a while, people spoke almost approvingly of the flood of liquidity. 
But this was just the flip side of what Keynes had worried about – insufficient global aggregate demand. 
The search for return contributed to the reckless leverage and risk taking that underlay this crisis. 
America’s government will, for a time, partly make up for the increasing savings of US consumers. 
A few years ago, there was worry about the risk of a disorderly unwinding of “global imbalances.” 
The current crisis can be viewed as part of that, but little is being done about the underlying problems that gave rise to these imbalances. 
We need not just temporary stimuli, but longer-term solutions. 
First, we need to reverse the worrying trends of growing inequality. 
More progressive income taxation will also help stabilize the economy, through what economists call “automatic stabilizers.” 
Second, the world needs enormous investments if it is to respond to the challenges of global warming. 
Transportation systems and living patterns must be changed dramatically. 
Third, a global reserve system is needed. 
It makes little sense for the world’s poorest countries to lend money to the richest at low interest rates. 
The system is unstable. 
The dollar reserve system is fraying, but is likely to be replaced with a dollar/euro or dollar/euro/yen system that is even more unstable. 
This year will be bleak. 
The question we need to be asking now is, how can we enhance the likelihood that we will eventually emerge into a robust recovery? 
Getting Prices Right 
As national economies and multinational companies compete for market share, global standards of market behavior become increasingly important. 
Furthermore, establishing accurate asset-price levels is essential to a well-functioning market. 
The state affects asset prices indirectly through its influence on inflation, interest rates, and the strength of the currency. 
Government intervention in benchmark prices can be justified in the name of macroeconomic management or regulatory action to improve the provision of public goods and services. 
After all, the state determines the supply of fiat money and is responsible for energy and natural-resource conservation. 
But there is a risk that the state can get important prices seriously wrong. 
This is particularly true of money, which has two prices. 
The distinction between the two prices is the foundation of modern finance theory. 
But the system rests on the assumption that the government will set accurate benchmark interest rates for risk-free assets. 
This pattern was evident in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the eurozone crisis that erupted in 2010. 
The logic and the mechanism that the government uses to set benchmark prices are very different from those that the market uses to set risk premia. 
Thus, the role of the market in price discovery is inextricable from that of the government. 
Indeed, there is a complex, non-linear feedback relationship between the two, so developing an accurate capital-pricing system depends on both actors. 
But, even in advanced countries, the influence of vested interests can lead to collective-action failures and, in turn, to incorrect benchmark rates. 
Meanwhile, given that many emerging economies have incomplete or immature PRIs, their influence over market-price discovery is relatively weak. 
In such systems, the government directly controls the benchmark interest rates. 
Herein lies the dilemma (one that China currently faces) of market-oriented reforms. 
Emerging economies have watched the leveraged power of investors distort the price-formation process in crisis-stricken advanced economies. 
Striking this balance is made even more complicated by the influence of advanced-country policies on emerging economies. 
In this environment, it may be appropriate to strengthen the global PRI further. 
The Root of All Sovereign-Debt Crises 
NEW YORK – The Greek debt crisis has prompted questions about whether the euro can survive without a nearly unimaginable centralization of fiscal policy. 
There is a simpler way. 
Irresponsible borrowing by governments in international credit markets requires irresponsible lending. 
Bank regulators should just say no to such lending by institutions that are already under their purview. 
Lending to foreign governments is in many ways inherently riskier than unsecured private debt or junk bonds. 
Private borrowers often have to offer collateral, such as their houses. 
The collateral limits the lenders’ downside risk, and the fear of losing the pledged assets encourages borrowers to act prudently. 
Only governments that are chronically unable to finance their outlays with domestic taxes or domestic debt must keep borrowing large sums abroad. 
A deep craving for the favor of foreign lenders usually derives from some deeply engrained form of misgoverance. 
Commercial debt usually has covenants that limit the borrower’s ability to roll the dice. 
Loan or bond covenants often require borrowers to agree to maintain a minimum level of equity capital or cash on hand. 
Government bonds, on the other hand, have no covenants. 
Similarly, private borrowers can go to prison if they misrepresent their financial condition to secure bank loans. 
Securities laws require that issuers of corporate bonds spell out all possible risks. 
By contrast, governments pay no penalties for outrageous misrepresentation or fraudulent accounting, as the Greek debacle shows. 
When private borrowers default, bankruptcy courts supervise a bankruptcy or reorganization process through which even unsecured creditors can hope to recover something. 
But there is no process for winding up a state and no legal venue for renegotiating its debts. 
Worse, the debt that states raise abroad is usually denominated in a currency whose value they cannot control. 
So a gradual, invisible reduction in the debt burden by debasing the currency is rarely an option. 
Lending to states thus involves unfathomable risks that ought to be borne by specialized players who are willing to live with the consequences. 
Historically, sovereign lending was a job for a few intrepid financiers, who drove shrewd bargains and were adept at statecraft. 
After the 1970’s, though, sovereign lending became institutionalized. 
Later, the Basel accords whetted banks’ appetite for more government bonds by ruling them virtually risk-free. 
Banks loaded up on the relatively high-yield debt of countries like Greece because they had to set aside very little capital. 
But, while the debt was highly rated, how could anyone objectively assess unsecured and virtually unenforceable obligations? 
The Greek debacle jeopardized the well-being of all of Europe, not only Greeks. 
This means no cross-border sovereign debt (or esoteric instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations). 
This simple rule would require no complex reordering of European fiscal arrangements, nor would it require the creation of new supra-national entities. 
It would certainly make it difficult for governments to borrow abroad, but that would be a good outcome for their citizens, not an imposition. 
Such constraints wouldn’t solve the current crisis in Portugal, Ireland, Greece, or Spain. 
The Roots of America’s Financial Crisis 
CAMBRIDGE – The US Federal Reserve’s desperate attempts to keep America’s economy from sinking are remarkable for at least two reasons. 
First, until just a few months ago, the conventional wisdom was that the US would avoid recession. 
Now recession looks certain. 
Second, the Fed’s actions do not seem to be effective. 
Although interest rates have been slashed and the Fed has lavished liquidity on cash-strapped banks, the crisis is deepening. 
To a large extent, the US crisis was actually made by the Fed, helped by the wishful thinking of the Bush administration. 
One main culprit was none other than Alan Greenspan, who left the current Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, with a terrible situation. 
But Bernanke was a Fed governor in the Greenspan years, and he, too, failed to diagnose correctly the growing problems with its policies. 
Today’s financial crisis has its immediate roots in 2001, amid the end of the Internet boom and the shock of the September 11 terrorist attacks. 
It was at that point that the Fed turned on the monetary spigots to try to combat an economic slowdown. 
The Fed held this rate too low for too long. 
Monetary expansion generally makes it easier to borrow, and lowers the costs of doing so, throughout the economy. 
It also tends to weaken the currency and increase inflation. 
All of this began to happen in the US. 
What was distinctive this time was that the new borrowing was concentrated in housing. 
The Fed declined to regulate these dubious practices. 
As the home-lending boom took hold, it became self-reinforcing. 
Greater home buying pushed up housing prices, which made banks feel that it was safe to lend money to non-creditworthy borrowers. 
After all, if they defaulted on their loans, the banks would repossess the house at a higher value. 
Or so the theory went. 
Of course, it works only as long as housing prices rise. 
What was stunning was how the Fed, under Greenspan’s leadership, stood by as the credit boom gathered steam, barreling toward a subsequent crash. 
There were a few naysayers, but not many in the financial sector itself. 
Banks were too busy collecting fees on new loans, and paying their managers outlandish bonuses. 
In the course of 2006 and 2007, the financial bubble that is now bringing down once-mighty financial institutions peaked. 
Banks’ balance sheets were by then filled with vast amounts of risky mortgages, packaged in complicated forms that made the risks hard to evaluate. 
Banks began to slow their new lending, and defaults on mortgages began to rise. 
Housing prices peaked as lending slowed, and prices then started to decline. 
But this time, credit expansion is not flowing into housing construction, but rather into commodity speculation and foreign currency. 
The Fed’s easy money policy is now stoking US inflation rather than a recovery. 
Oil, food, and gold prices have jumped to historic highs, and the dollar has depreciated to historic lows. 
A Euro now costs around $1.60, up from $0.90 in January 2002. 
Having stoked a boom, now the Fed can’t prevent at least a short-term decline in the US economy, and maybe worse. 
There is still a good chance, however, that the US downturn will be limited mainly to America, where the housing boom and bust is concentrated. 
The damage to the rest of the world economy, I believe, can remain limited. 
The Roots of China’s Rapid Recovery 
For much of the world, China’s ability to shrug off the global financial crisis and maintain a strong growth trajectory in 2010 and 2011 seems too easy. 
But securing China’s growth has been anything but easy. 
The strong, decisive, and deftly timed stimulus policies at the start of the financial crisis did, of course, play a major role in China’s quick rebound. 
Other policy moves aimed at boosting demand in the housing and auto market also proved effective. 
But China’s crisis management is only part of the story. 
That gave Chinese policymakers freedom to spend money to confront the crisis. 
Moreover, the Chinese economy was in good shape when the global crisis hit. 
Cautious macroeconomic management during China’s boom, including early self-adjustment, put China in a favorable position. 
China’s economy had been booming since 2004, but officials did not step aside and “let the market decide.” 
Instead, they adopted counter-cyclical measures aimed at preventing the economy from overheating. 
As a result, by the fourth quarter of 2007 – one year before the global financial crisis hit – China’s economy started to cool. 
The quarterly growth rate decelerated from 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 9% in the third quarter of 2009. 
The lesson is that booms have to be managed adeptly, and that financiers have to be supervised in their pursuit of ever-higher returns. 
That is true for developed economies no less than for a developing economy like China. 
Of course, China’s economy has structural and institutional problems – what developing country does not? 
China’s macroeconomic policies are probably still too “administrative.” 
To be sure, the authorities have sometimes been overly cautious. 
But for an economy in its early stage of development, and for the first generation of companies with young “animal spirits,” excessive caution seems better than the alternative. 
In fact, when a country’s economic growth is continuously above 9%, policymakers probably cannot be too cautious. 
No doubt, government macroeconomic management that is too strong may delay necessary market-oriented reforms. 
But the financial crisis has shown that a twenty-first-century market economy requires government participation to function. 
The Roots of Islamic Backwardness 
The war in Iraq is over. 
By that logic, capitalism and Islam are incompatible. 
Are they? 
History may provide some guidance here. 
Steam power, factories, markets, and industry quickly spread throughout northwest Europe and its settler colonies. 
Beyond these limits, however, the fires of the Industrial Revolution barely smoldered, if they burned at all. 
His decree went nowhere: Egypt did not industrialize, and Mehemet Ali's great grandchildren did indeed become puppets of the British and French. 
In many respects, the slow pace of the Islamic world's economic development has been a matter of choice. 
Industrialization means novelty and change. 
But slow and distorted development in the Islamic world is the result of blocked opportunities as well. 
Wouldn't Pakistan be much better off if it exported more of its textiles to the rich industrial world? 
No doubt it would have been. 
Of course. 
But property rights and contracts are threatened at many levels. 
They are threatened by roving bandits, by local notables, and, most of all, by government functionaries who use their offices to extort extra income. 
However, the most important reasons that the Islamic world has done worse than Latin America or Southeast Asia seem to be focused around education. 
After all, blocked export opportunities, weak government institutions, and high levels of corruption are worldwide problems. 
Even political and religious leaders hostile to change and industrialization are not uncommon. 
The Roots of Sino-American Antagonism 
Both nations have a long and complicated history with each other. 
To travel through urban China today is in many ways a deceptive experience. 
Yes, China has emerged into the global market and boasts many of the hallmarks of a modernizing society. 
Many of these emblems of modernity and cosmopolitanism, however, mask the provenance of China's “socialist revolution.” 
This bitter experience reached an apogee in the 1930s and '40s with Japan's brutal occupation. 
It is not extreme to describe China's reaction to such incidents as almost robotic. 
To achieve this, it will probably have to transcend its Marxists�Leninist heritage – something it has begun to do in important ways. 
The Rules of Reconstruction 
Lebanon’s reconstruction, so painstakingly carried out in the 1990’s, is now at risk of being undone. 
Indeed, in East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and many other countries, the transition to peace seems to be failing. 
Likewise, there is unfinished business in many other countries undergoing reconstruction. 
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), for example, just held its first elections in 40 years. 
The stability of the Great Lakes region of Africa, perhaps that continent’s most violent area, will depend on the success of its transition and reconstruction. 
When wars end, countries confront a multi-pronged transition. 
These multiple tasks make economic reconstruction fundamentally different from “development as usual.” 
To meet these goals, the objective of peace should prevail over that of development if the two come into conflict. 
Often, optimal economic policies and best practices are not attainable – or even desirable. 
This also means that peace-related programs should get priority in budget allocations. 
Of course, the legitimacy of the government or other policymaking body will determine what is possible in economic policymaking. 
Indeed, early privatization is likely to be destructive in its own terms, because property rights will remain in question for some time. 
Thus, a new yardstick is needed to measure success. 
Projects must be judged by whether they contribute to peace and reconciliation, rather than on purely economic grounds. 
Effective demobilization and reconciliation in El Salvador, for example, ensured the consolidation of peace after that country’s brutal civil war of the 1980’s. 
Elsewhere, however, disregarding the primacy of politics in a transition to peace has had tragic consequences. 
Yet, time and again, the UN has shown itself to be incompetent in this role. 
The commercial exploitation of rich oil and gas reserves in the Timor Gap could have facilitated reconstruction and created jobs for the 30% of the labor force that is unemployed. 
Instead, with the strong approval of the IMF, East Timor created a Norwegian-style “petroleum fund” to save the money for a rainy day. 
But in East Timor, that rainy day is now. 
Iraq provides numerous examples of the dangers created by misplaced priorities. 
But the United States has not learned its lesson. 
On the verge of civil war, Iraq just announced a restructuring of its foreign debt. 
Despite its failures, the UN is probably still the best-placed organization to oversee such efforts. 
The Russian Revival 
Russia’s national revival and new assertiveness under President Vladimir Putin is not really home made but reflects highly auspicious international conditions. 
Putin’s administration has been keen to take advantage of this favorable environment. 
Yet, although some of the Kremlin’s moves seem clear and reasonable, others can scarcely be described as rational or forward-looking. 
For example, Russia’s desire to take ownership stakes in Europe’s gas distribution markets makes perfect sense and is fully legitimate given Russia’s energy assets and pipeline capacity. 
Likewise, Russia’s effort to expand its influence in the energy-rich countries of Central Asia is aimed at consolidating Russia’s stature as a major energy supplier. 
Should instability ignite into open warfare, Russia will find it impossible to avoid the consequences. 
Of course, Georgia’s President Mikhail Saakashvili may at times be thoughtless and arrogant. 
But if Russia’s policy toward him lets events in Georgia get out of control, Russia will be held accountable. 
Because Russia claims the status of a world power, it is expected to show restraint and responsibility. 
But the urge to project strength for the mere sake of doing so now seems overwhelming for the Kremlin. 
This lingering resentment may explain Putin’s somewhat uncivil behavior and dubious jokes when dealing with his Western counterparts. 
What possible benefits can Russia gain by breaking this pledge? 
The motive seems to be brutally simple: “Precisely because you want it, we won’t deliver. 
We can do what we like because we’re strong again.” 
But this renewed vigor is too fresh for Russia to feel truly confident. 
Putin’s irresistible urge to remind everyone that Russia has recovered its strength suggests underlying insecurity. 
Russia is by no means seeking to isolate itself. 
Moreover, it is in the West where the rich and powerful Russian elite likes to travel, go shopping, and send their kids to school. 
But Russia’s muscle-flexing behavior leaves Western leaders perplexed and wary, which seems a dubious way for the Kremlin to secure Russia’s new stature. 
Contentious foreign policy makes contacts uneasy and agreements difficult to reach. 
It damages the trust needed for stronger trade relations. 
What will happen should crude strength and hard language prove inadequate to the task of insuring Russian national interests? 
No one can say, but Russia’s history in this regard is not a source of hope. 
The Russians are Coming – With Cash 
MOSCOW – Russia’s government is sitting on a giant pile of cash that it plans to invest in foreign assets. 
As Prime Minister Vladimir Putin remarked at a recent meeting with the CEO of state-owned bank VTB, “Perhaps we should buy something [abroad]? 
Should the West really consider blocking Russian investments abroad as a way to influence Russia? 
Trying to erect an Iron Curtain around Russian funds and businesses will prove counterproductive. 
Indeed, a large-scale “invasion” of Russian business would be a positive development, because it would foster economic interdependence. 
This is true even if the economic expansion is led by state-owned companies and by Russian sovereign wealth funds. 
By investing in American and European assets, Russia’s government and business elites are buying a stake in the global economy. 
This should bring better mutual understanding and a more rational and accountable foreign policy. 
Paradoxically, despite recent hits to the Russian stock market, Russia remains awash with cash. 
Yet, even this package has not significantly eaten into Russia’s sovereign wealth funds and its world’s third largest currency reserves. 
By design, these funds are intended to be invested outside Russia. 
As today’s financial crisis has made many Western assets cheap, they are now within reach of Russia’s government and leading Russian companies. 
Russian private and state-owned companies have already invested abroad extensively, often buying stakes in large foreign companies. 
The largest controversy surrounded a merger that Russian steel giant SeverStal sought with Luxemburg-based Arcelor. 
SeverStal was rejected in favor of Mittal Steel, with some commentators claiming that the decision was taken on political grounds. 
But no investment by a private Russian company has, so far, been vetoed by Western governments. 
Yet hostility towards investment by Russia’s government (and government companies) has been almost universal until recently. 
US and European policymakers do not trust that foreign governments (and their sovereign wealth funds) invest solely on business grounds. 
But the financial crisis is making the West happy to find “friends with cash.” 
During his visit to Russia in June, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson emphasized that the US is interested in welcoming Russian investment, including investment by Russia’s sovereign wealth funds. 
But Russia’s government still needs to set up a transparent and accountable structure to manage its sovereign wealth. 
Doing so will also help to convince other countries that the government’s agenda is economic, not political. 
Russian authorities may be advancing that goal by taking initial steps toward improving corporate governance in state-owned companies. 
In an unprecedented move, the government replaced a large number of bureaucrats on the boards of these companies with independent directors (including a couple of foreigners). 
The key benefit of Russian foreign investment is not economic, but that it helps Russia become a global citizen. 
They have too much to lose from a worsening political climate between Russia and the West. 
The Sarkozy Option 
Despite his failed bid to orchestrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, was he not right to try? 
The answer is far from clear, and is probably a combination of both. 
Sarkozy is a man prone to following his instincts. 
He does not theorize about what should be done; he simply does it, without any ideological bias or constraint. 
But now one could describe him as “Sarkozy the Westerner.” 
In a deeper way, Sarkozy’s diplomacy reflects changes in how the French President thinks about the idea of “the West” in today’s globalized world. 
The same cannot be said of Sarkozy, despite his claims to the contrary. 
His rapprochement with Great Britain and his noticeable distancing of France from Germany are, from this perspective, no accident. 
In a world where, in comparative terms, there is less America because of the rise of China and India and the resurgence of Russia, and less Europe in diplomatic and strategic terms (due to institutional paralysis), if not economic and cultural terms, France, according to Sarkozy, must clearly define itself as part of the West. 
Moreover, it would be paradoxical if, just when America declares its willingness to call more upon its allies, particularly its European allies, the concept of the West actually leads to the diminution, if not the burial, of the European ideal. 
The Scaremongers of the Roundtable 
It is not happening in Latin America or in socialist Sweden, but in the United States of America. 
In the current system, corporate boards are self-perpetuating entities. 
To be elected, a board member needs to be nominated by the current board, where executives have considerable influence. 
Even independent directors, often acclaimed as the solution to all problems, are subject to the same pressure. 
To change this state of affairs, institutional investors must be allowed to propose their own slate of directors. 
The possibility of being rejected in a real election would naturally make board members accountable to shareholders, indirectly making the executives accountable as well. 
The SEC rule was an attempt to grant institutional investors this right. 
It did it in a very mild format. 
This is a very high hurdle. 
In June 2009, the largest US pension fund (Calpers) owned less than 0.3% of large companies such as Coca Cola and Microsoft. 
Thus, one had to coordinate ten such funds to reach the quorum. 
And even that would not suffice. 
Thus, to achieve that 3% of voting power and maintain it for three years continuously, one would have to assemble hundreds of institutions. 
Ironically, in 2007, in response to an earlier SEC proposal to grant shareholders’ access to proxy, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen ampamp; 
Five years after Enron and WorldCom, the capital markets are well into a cycle of unprecedented vigor.” 
In other words, if the stock market is doing well, we should not change the rules of the game that are credited for this success. 
But if the stock market is doing poorly, the rules of the games are not responsible and we cannot afford to change them. 
That is a peculiar notion of accountability. 
To block the rule, the Business Roundtable filed a petition with the US Court of Appeals to invalidate it. 
This is just a pretense. 
A similar rule has been in place in Italy since 2005, and there is no sign that efficiency, competition, or capital formation has been affected. 
Is this the revolution that the Business Roundtable is afraid of? 
Unfortunately, the scare tactics employed by the Business Roundtable worked. 
It is a great victory for business executives, but a huge defeat for the principles that should guide capitalism. 
The Science of Acupuncture 
Like many other traditional Chinese medicines, acupuncture has for many centuries been viewed suspiciously in the West. 
It seems to work, but how? 
Is a scientific answer possible? 
Some 36% of Chinese doctors think the effectiveness of acupuncture remains uncertain, perhaps because the scientific basis for it remains so new. 
Recently, however, systematic scientific studies of acupuncture’s effects in such treatment has begun. 
Almost all trials on acupuncture as a treatment for stroke conducted within China have been positive. 
Indeed, all the trials performed before June 1995 in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were deemed positive by the British researchers. 
After three months or more of treatment, the numbers rose even more significantly in favor of those treated by acupuncture. 
Oddly, when comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, the statistical difference concerning death or the need for institutional care was small. 
For example, many trials did not describe their method of measuring statistical relevance, and only called themselves “randomized controlled trials.” 
Only four trials, with 373 patients, could provide data on death or dependency (becoming dependent on others for activities of daily living). 
Part of the problem in China is choosing the patients to be studied. 
Getting such patients to accept being put into a control group where no acupuncture is applied is almost impossible. 
But no one has yet specified what the appropriate outcome measures for acupuncture should be. 
The results will be reported after analysis of the trial data and could prove useful for therapy of stroke patients. 
At present, however, there is insufficient evidence for routine use of acupuncture in stroke. 
More high-quality trials are needed. 
We do know that acupuncture is a safe, inexpensive, widely accepted, and potentially effective therapy. 
The Scientific Men's Club 
I serve on the senior appointments and promotions committee of a medical school. 
Over the years, I've come to recognize something that is as disturbing as it is undeniable: as a group, male basic scientists sail through the committee effortlessly. 
These are their "peers," and they readily provide laudatory letters of recommendation establishing that the applicant has attained "national and international recognition." 
In contrast, applications by clinical faculty and women provoke far more discussion. 
I don't resent the ease with which basic science faculty are promoted; after all, I am sure that I also enjoyed the perks that come with this designation. 
Nonetheless, the system seems blatantly unfair. 
We rely on external referees for promoting basic scientists, who publish their work in national or international journals. 
By contrast, it is difficult to quantify how good clinical scientists are. 
The issue of women faculty members, especially in basic sciences, is far more complex. 
I suspect that here the problem reflects fundamental differences between the way women and men approach science as a microcosm of life. 
Most of my fellow male faculty members are not muscle-bound, testosterone-driven types, but in their scientific careers, they display two types of typically male behavior. 
The first is a compulsion to be the first to establish completely trivial facts about science. 
Ten or 15 years from now, will anybody care? 
Most women in basic sciences seem to be uninterested from the outset in playing such games. 
Women scientists seem to behave far more collegially. 
There is a certain senior (male) faculty member who is one of the kindest and most accomplished investigators at my institution. 
He is surrounded by and works with a group of young women he has mentored. 
At the risk of sounding simplistic, I can't help feeling that working together as a group is an innately feminine tendency. 
Almost every time a woman candidate comes up before the committee, her "independence" is questioned in a way that is irrelevant, if not insulting. 
"I made it," they seem to say, "so why can't she?" 
In most cases, the women are as smart as the men, if not smarter. 
But most have chosen to work either in a group with their mentors or with their husbands, who often work in the same fields. 
Although they generate as many of the ideas as their male colleagues do, it is the latter who go to meetings and present the group's research results. 
There was surely a time when eschewing children and family was the only way that a woman could prove her commitment to science. 
In many places, that has begun to change. 
The Scientific Road to Copenhagen 
The meeting was chaired by Prince Albert. 
Despite efforts by some leading countries to lower expectations ahead of the conference about what can and will be achieved, the meeting is still being called the most important conference since World War II. 
An orphan who was educated by monks, Fourier was a professor at the age of 18, and became Napoleon’s governor in Egypt before returning to a career in science. 
In 1824, Fourier discovered why our planet’s climate is so warm – tens of degrees warmer than a simple calculation of its energy balance would suggest. 
The sun brings heat, and earth radiates heat back into space – but the numbers did not balance. 
Fourier realized that gases in our atmosphere trap heat. 
He called his discovery l’effet de serre – the greenhouse effect. 
It was Tyndall who then put Fourier’s ideas to the test in his laboratory. 
In 1859, Tyndall described the greenhouse effect in beautifully concise words: “The atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat, but checks its exit; and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet.” 
Then, in 1897, Svante Arrhenius, who earned a Nobel Prize for chemistry six years later, calculated how much global warming a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere would cause. 
Arrhenius was not in the least troubled by the prospect of global warming. 
But it was all just theory in Arrhenius’s time, since nobody had measurements to prove that CO2 levels in the atmosphere were in fact increasing. 
This may be sufficient to produce measurable and perhaps marked changes in climate.” 
We did not have to wait until 2000 to find these predictions were correct: by the 1980’s, global warming became apparent in temperature measurements from weather stations around the world. 
In 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was founded to analyze the issue in more detail, and in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro world leaders signed a historic treaty: the Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
Its goal: “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” 
Unfortunately, little has been achieved in the 17 years since then. 
And even the rate at which emissions are increasing is now three times higher than in the 1990’s. 
Global temperatures had already risen by 0.5 ºC above preindustrial levels by the early 1990’s, and another 0.3ºC have been added to that since the Rio Earth Summit. 
Most countries now agree that global warming should be stopped at a maximum of two degrees centigrade. 
But this has become an extremely tough challenge, as growth in greenhouse-gas emissions and atmospheric stocks accelerated in the years since Rio. 
That is why Copenhagen is so important: it may well be our last to address climate change before it addresses us. 
Tyndall’s measurements 150 years ago showed that carbon dioxide traps heat and causes warming. 
And, 50 years ago, Keeling’s measurements showed that CO2 levels are increasing. 
The Scoundrels of Economic Patriotism 
Samuel Johnson called patriotism “the last refuge of a scoundrel.” 
If that is true, what should we think of today’s mounting economic nationalism, sometimes euphemistically described as “economic patriotism”? 
Indeed, economic nationalism is exceptionally vigorous at the moment. 
Vigorous popular opposition to a Dubai company’s plan to take over ports in the United States shocked the American government. 
Poland is witnessing a populist backlash against foreign ownership of banks. 
France is blocking the acquisition of French utilities by the Italian electricity company Enel. 
Defenders of these ill-fated cross-border takeovers worry that a sinister whiff of the twentieth century’s worst moments is in the air. 
An outraged Italian minister warned of a new mobilization of populist nationalism in an “August 1914” scenario. 
In 1911, the diplomatic crisis over Morocco was accompanied by a French speculative attack on German financial markets. 
In the 1930’s, both France and Germany used this kind of technique as a way to bolster their own security. 
The US tried to control Japanese expansion in Asia by limiting Japan’s energy (especially petroleum) imports. 
The most obvious reason for increased worries about security in America is the challenge of meeting the threat of terrorism after the attacks of September 2001. 
But that can scarcely explain European nervousness and the protectionist reaction. 
In Europe’s case, two contrasting explanations exist. 
The first is that the new worries are a strange case of psychological transference. 
People in places like France and Poland who worry about national decline seek to blame somebody outside the country. 
The modern version of this explanation holds that the world is changing so quickly that national security and, indeed, national identity, are under threat. 
An alternative scenario suggests that these fears emanate from a real problem. 
Modern economic growth still depends in almost every advanced industrial country on imported energy (Norway is an exception). 
Because of fears about pollution, or about the safety of nuclear energy, most countries neglected to build up their own capacity. 
The resulting vulnerability was highlighted by the Russian reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine in January, which resulted in reduced flows to central and western Europe. 
The experience made Poles particularly jittery, and pushed the country’s populist right-wing government down the road of economic nationalism. 
But West Europeans remember their own traumas, including electricity grid failures and widespread blackouts. 
Wouldn’t an Italian company facing grid failure prefer to shut down French rather than Italian consumers? 
Fear creates a demand for state action. 
Politicians like this because it increases demand for their services. 
They point out the potential problem and then attempt to sell solutions that lie within their nationally defined spheres of competence. 
One modern politician, in particular, has been effective in placing nervousness about energy supply at the center of a new political vision. 
According to Vladimir Putin, the need to control and secure energy justifies a massive extension of state intervention in the economy. 
Putin’s vision was apparently vindicated by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US. 
Since then, Putin has projected his vision of politicized energy in a way that makes all Europeans, not just Russians, nervous. 
That bolsters his strength in the Russian setting. 
But a Putin in one country has a tendency to produce Putin imitators elsewhere. 
We should be concerned about the efficiency losses in markets where restrictions stemming from economic nationalism have so far been imposed. 
Fear generates a demand for more security that is in the end paralyzing. 
The Search for Quality on the Web 
NEW YORK – In the not-so-distant future, students will be able to graduate from high school without ever touching a book. 
Twenty years ago, they could graduate from high school without ever using a computer. 
In only a few decades,amp#160;computer technology and the Internet have transformed the core principles of information, knowledge, and education. 
Indeed, today you can fit more books on the hard disk of your laptop computer than in a bookstore carrying 60,000 titles. 
Such analogies help us visualize the immensity of the information explosion and ratify the concerns that come with it. 
Search engines are the single most powerful distribution points of knowledge, wealth, and yes, misinformation. 
When we talk about Web search, the first name that pops up is, of course, Google. 
It is not far-fetched to say that Google made the Internet what it is today. 
It shaped a new generation of people who are strikingly different from their parents. 
Baby boomers might be the best placed to appreciate this, since they experienced Rock 'n’ Roll as kids and Google as parents. 
Google’s design was based on statistical algorithms. 
You can collect statistics until the cows come home, but you cannot expect statistics to produce an effect beyond what they are good for. 
In addition, statistics collection systems are backward-looking. 
They need time for people to make referrals, and time to collect them. 
It is a billion-dollar industry. 
The underlying idea behind semantic technology is to teach computers how the world operates. 
For example, when a computer encounters the word “bill,” it would know that “bill” has 15 different meanings in English. 
By contrast, “kill bill” would only be the title of the movie by that name. 
At the end, a series of deductions like these would handle entire sentences and paragraphs to yield an accurate text-meaning representation. 
To achieve this level of dexterity in handling languages by computer algorithms, an ontology must be built. 
Ontology is neither a dictionary nor a thesaurus. 
It is a map of interconnected concepts and word senses that reflect relationships such as those that exist between the concepts of “bill” and “kill.” 
Several start-up companies around the world, like Hakia , Cognition Search , and Lexxe , have taken on this challenge. 
The result of these efforts remains to be seen. 
But how would a semantic search engine solve the information quality problem? 
The answer is simple: precision. 
Semantic technology promises other means of assuring quality, by detecting the richness and coherence of the concepts encountered in a given text. 
Or is this page a spam page that includes a bunch of popular single-liners wrapped with ads? 
Semantic technology can discern what it is. 
We cannot afford a future in which knowledge is at the mercy of popularity and money. 
The Second Coming of Barack Obama 
WASHINGTON, DC – The race was tough, but US President Barack Obama has won re-election. 
The question now, for the United States and the world, is what will he do with a fresh four-year term? 
To win re-election with a still-weak economy and unemployment close to 8% was not easy. 
Some aspects of the campaign, particularly the amount of money spent and its negative tone, struck many observers as objectionable. 
Obama will embark on his second term with the global economy at a crossroads. 
In the US, the uneven and weak recovery has been sustained by extraordinarily expansive monetary policies and ongoing large fiscal deficits. 
While corporate coffers hold mountains of cash, private investment stagnates. 
In Japan, solid economic performance remains elusive, while prime ministers succeed each other at a breathtaking pace. 
Likewise, Europe is on life support, thanks to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s astute maneuvering and promises of unlimited intervention in sovereign-debt markets. 
The situation in Greece, moreover, has become socially unsustainable; 
Greece is small, but a total collapse there could have very negative financial and psychological effects elsewhere. 
The world economy is an interdependent whole: trouble in any important part of it is transmitted globally. 
American ideas continue to affect the policy debate worldwide. 
So, what should Obama’s top economic-policy priorities be in his second term? 
Despite the difficulties facing the global economy, there are huge investible resources in the US, China, Germany, and elsewhere. 
But sustainable economic growth requires that those with investible resources actually invest them. 
There are plenty of profits to be made – actual taxes on capital are not too high, and cheap finance is available to the corporate sector. 
This is vital for many countries, above all the US and China. 
Then there is the pressing need – in the US and globally – for education and appropriate skill formation. 
Without the skills required by new and incipient technologies, too many workers will simply be unemployable. 
A key benefit of prioritizing broad-based quality education is that it also helps to solve the income-distribution problem. 
Finally, there is the need for effective international cooperation. 
After America’s long, hard-fought election campaign, it is time for comprehensive policy reforms. 
The Second Great Contraction 
CAMBRIDGE – Why is everyone still referring to the recent financial crisis as the “Great Recession”? 
The term, after all, is predicated on a dangerous misdiagnosis of the problems that confront the United States and other countries, leading to bad forecasts and bad policy. 
The phrase “Great Recession” creates the impression that the economy is following the contours of a typical recession, only more severe – something like a really bad cold. 
That is why, throughout this downturn, forecasters and analysts who have tried to make analogies to past post-war US recessions have gotten it so wrong. 
A more accurate, if less reassuring, term for the ongoing crisis is the “Second Great Contraction.” 
The first “Great Contraction” of course, was the Great Depression, as emphasized by Anna Schwarz and the late Milton Friedman. 
Why argue about semantics? 
Well, imagine you have pneumonia, but you think it is only a bad cold. 
In a conventional recession, the resumption of growth implies a reasonably brisk return to normalcy. 
The economy not only regains its lost ground, but, within a year, it typically catches up to its rising long-run trend. 
The aftermath of a typical deep financial crisis is something completely different. 
As Reinhart and I demonstrated, it typically takes an economy more than four years just to reach the same per capita income level that it had attained at its pre-crisis peak. 
But, in a “Great Contraction,” problem number one is too much debt. 
If governments that retain strong credit ratings are to spend scarce resources effectively, the most effective approach is to catalyze debt workouts and reductions. 
For example, governments could facilitate the write-down of mortgages in exchange for a share of any future home-price appreciation. 
For example, rich countries’ voters in Europe could perhaps be persuaded to engage in a much larger bailout for Greece (one that is actually big enough to work), in exchange for higher payments in ten to fifteen years if Greek growth outperforms. 
In my December 2008 column, I argued that the only practical way to shorten the coming period of painful deleveraging and slow growth would be a sustained burst of moderate inflation, say, 4-6% for several years. 
Of course, inflation is an unfair and arbitrary transfer of income from savers to debtors. 
But, at the end of the day, such a transfer is the most direct approach to faster recovery. 
Eventually, it will take place one way or another, anyway, as Europe is painfully learning. 
Some observers regard any suggestion of even modestly elevated inflation as a form of heresy. 
But Great Contractions, as opposed to recessions, are very infrequent events, occurring perhaps once every 70 or 80 years. 
The big rush to jump on the “Great Recession” bandwagon happened because most analysts and policymakers simply had the wrong framework in mind. 
Unfortunately, by now it is far too clear how wrong they were. 
Acknowledging that we have been using the wrong framework is the first step toward finding a solution. 
The Secret Language of Central Bankers 
There was an old argument for “Greenspanese”: voters or politicians or both are inherently short-sighted and myopic. 
They would always see and want to grasp the benefits of lower interest rates and a little more demand pressure – more production, more employment, higher wages, and higher profits in the short run. 
There seems to be general agreement today that this argument no longer applies, if it was ever truly valid. 
The debate about monetary policy can thus be fruitful and productive even if it is no longer restricted to those who have learned “Greenspanese.” 
But recently – and increasingly so in recent months – central bankers’ doubts about the utility of the transparency initiative have increased. 
More information may be leading not to better knowledge, but to more confusion. 
We economists have a hard time figuring out why there appears to be so much static on the communications line. 
Why are cable TV personalities so eager to overstate how quickly central banks change their view of the likely future? 
We don’t have answers to these questions. 
So we really don't know whether we should tell central bankers to brush up on their Greenspanese. 
The Secret of Harvard’s Success 
AHMEDABAD, INDIA – No country dominates any industry as much as the United States dominates higher education. 
Although the US boasts the world’s largest economy, it comprises only one-quarter of global GDP, and possesses roughly one-twentieth of the world’s population. 
And its support for research is not unique. 
Moreover, according to the accepted explanation, large countries such as France, Germany, Japan, and even China and India should also be represented at the top of global university rankings. 
But they appear only sparsely anywhere in such rankings, if even at all. 
In fact, these countries lack a crucial piece of the puzzle: America’s innovative governance model for higher education. 
Harvard was established as a public institution in 1636 by the authorities of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. 
When Harvard alumni dominated the Massachusetts legislature, the university was given support and consideration. 
Almost immediately, Harvard came under attack for being too elitist, too exclusive, and too expensive. 
Even its curriculum was challenged. 
This behavior culminated in 1862, when the legislature blocked a university president’s appointment. 
Since then, Harvard’s Board of Overseers, has been controlled exclusively by alumni. 
The only exception, the California Institute of Technology, has a board with 40% alumni representation. 
Alumni run the show even at public institutions such as Purdue (90%) and Michigan (63%). 
On average, alumni make up 63% of the boards of the top 100 US universities, both public and private. 
In general, a higher percentage of alumni on the board is associated with a higher ranking, increased selectivity, and a larger endowment. 
After all, no group cares more about a university’s prestige than its alumni, who gain or lose esteem as their alma mater’s ranking rises or falls. 
Indeed, alumni have the most incentive to donate generously, and to manage the university effectively. 
Given their intimate knowledge of the university, alumni are also the most effective leaders. 
Through alumni networks, board members can acquire information quickly and act upon it without delay. 
All great universities are nonprofit organizations, created to administer higher education, which benefits society as a whole. 
But US universities found a way to integrate competition’s benefits into the European concept of nonprofit, or so-called eleemosynary, corporations. 
Using alumni to infuse the benefits of competition into nonprofit institutions exemplifies the genius of American adaptation. 
Countries that aspire to compete with US universities should take note. 
The Secret Policeman’s Fall 
Like Hungary, post-communist Romania has struggled to increase transparency and honesty in what was once one of the world’s most closed societies. 
As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office. 
Judicial reforms are, in turn, helping to root out corruption. 
Indictments have been issued against former and current cabinet ministers, members of parliament, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police and customs officers, and other public officials, as well as directors of private companies. 
The new declarations are the most detailed in Europe, and, more importantly, they are published. 
Specifically, 60% of the requests filed in Romania met, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain. 
Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania. 
But getting access to sensitive information in transitional democracies is not always easier, as I know from my previous work as a human rights lawyer with the Romanian Helsinki Committee. 
Often we had to go to court to force disclosure of information, using Romania’s 2001 Freedom of Information Act. 
We filed a civil action against the prosecutor, and the judge imposed a fine for every day the information was withheld. 
With its publication, Romania began to move away from its Securitate-dominated past. 
Now, inside government, I realize that sharing information with the public is sometimes hard. 
But when painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative. 
Indeed, this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world. 
When the United States adopted its Freedom of Information Act in 1966, it joined the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland. 
Today, roughly 65 countries have such laws. 
In Romania, those who fought for a freedom of information law have made full use of it. 
Such information is both a product and a motor of continuing reform. 
It has not always been comfortable for those in government, and there is still a tug-of-war over sensitive documents. 
But, in the former communist bloc, the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable. 
The Secret World of Female Circumcision 
NAIROBI – As a child in rural Kenya, I was a secret admirer of female genital mutilation. 
Perhaps these were the reasons why, as a girl of 13, I longed to be “circumcised” and become a “real woman.” 
I tried to persuade my mother to permit my circumcision, but she refused. 
My mother’s decision angered me. 
In frustration, I spoke with a few other schoolgirls. 
And yet the friends to whom I spoke encouraged me to get circumcised. 
So one August, during my school holidays, I decided to learn more about female genital circumcision. 
I decided to witness a girl undergoing the practice, and perhaps see her cry and bleed. 
If possible, I would talk to her later in order to gain a clearer picture of her experience. 
I went ahead with my plan and witnessed a girl being circumcised. 
The experience changed my life, but not in the way I expected. 
Before the operation, traditional heroic songs were sung, while a few older women sharpened their knives, preparing for the task ahead. 
They also prepared special herbs for use as disinfectants. 
I paid little attention to their preparations, actually. 
My eyes were fixed on Lillian, a girlfriend who was waiting to be cut. 
When the women began their work, Lillian’s expression turned from giddy anticipation to fear and then panic. 
I thought she might change her mind and run for her life. 
I was mistaken. 
She sat on a traditional stool and spread her legs wide apart. 
An old woman bent over her, knife in hand. 
I looked away and heard a sharp scream. 
The scream was swallowed by cheers from scores of women watching Lillian with me. 
They celebrated Lillian’s mutilation, while I mourned her loss. 
In my mind, Lillian was experiencing the worst moment of her life. 
In an instant, my view of female circumcision changed forever. 
While the women around me kept cheering, I resolved that from then on I would resist the practice with all my might. 
Because of my mother’s support, and my own determination, I succeeded in keeping my body intact. 
I went on to finish high school and then study journalism in a big city far from home. 
I escaped mutilation, but other girls from my rural Kenyan community continue to receive “the cut” to this day. 
When the girl died, her father and fiancé conspired to have her body secretly buried in the bush. 
Kenya’s police learned of the girl’s death and legal action is being prepared against the men. 
But punishment for the perpetrators of female circumcision remains rare. 
The practice persists, despite legal bans. 
As a child-welfare officer in Narok told me, “Unless attitudes are changed, efforts to stamp out the practice will be futile." 
Parents’ attitudes are changing, but slowly. 
Government can do more, of course. 
One new initiative calls for local leaders to be dismissed whenever high numbers of girls drop out of school. 
The logic is compelling: if girls remain in school, they can avoid “the cut” and early marriage. 
At the same time, much more needs to be done to combat the practice, in Kenya and everywhere in Africa where it continues. 
International opposition helps. 
For decades, activists in the United States and Europe have brought attention to the problem and urged African governments to prosecute perpetrators. 
Only if we change the views of our friends and neighbors can more girls escape “the cut” – and never long for it. 
The Secular and Sacred in Europe's Constitution 
One controversy surrounding the draft constitution for the European Union is whether or not to include an explicit reference to Europe's Christian heritage in its preamble. 
Silvio Ferrari, a noted scholar of Church‑State relations, dissects the issues. 
Some people demand that the constitution include some explicit reference to Europe's Christian heritage. 
Others want Europe to affirm its secular nature. 
What role should the secular and the sacred play in the European Union's fundamental law? 
Unsurprisingly, religious freedom is given prominence in the draft constitution. 
Every European citizen has the right to practice the religion of his or her choice, to adopt another religion, or to practice no religion. 
The second guiding principle concerns the autonomy of religious communities. 
The EU recognizes the "identity and specific contribution" of churches to European life. 
Separation of church and state does not mean mutual ignorance. 
The common good benefits more from open, transparent dialogue than by turning a deaf ear to religion‑‑that is, provided that the borders between religion and politics are clearly defined. 
The state's laicité ‑‑fundamental in most European countries‑‑does not require isolating churches in political ghettoes. 
Defining the church‑state system and its principal features is a right of the citizens of each EU member state. 
Of course, improvements are possible. 
Equal treatment of religious communities is not mentioned in the text prepared by the European Convention. 
If there is no equality, religious liberty is at risk. 
Regular dialogue with religious communities, though a good thing, should not be extended to purely secular areas. 
It is here that efforts to include a reference to Europe's Judeo‑Christian heritage in the preamble of the Constitution must be considered dispassionately. 
Of course, European civilization arises from a synthesis of religious and humanistic values. 
But mentioning a specific religious tradition in Europe's Constitution is dubious. 
It would be largely symbolic and, although symbols are important and help to foster unity, they are dangerous when they exclude and divide. 
This would be a bonanza for Muslim fundamentalists, and could be exploited by all who want to prevent the development of a moderate, modern European Islam. 
The Security Trap 
CHICAGO – Even as the world becomes more integrated, the word “security” crops up again and again, as in “food security” or “energy security.” 
Typically, this means a country creating and controlling production facilities no matter what the cost. 
Thus, Arab countries grow water-hungry grain in the desert, and China acquires part ownership of oil companies in Sudan. 
Are these economically sensible actions? 
If not, what should the world do to reduce the need for them? 
Let’s start with ownership of foreign resources. 
One might think that a country that owns foreign oil can use the profits from sales to insulate its economy from high world oil prices. 
But this makes no economic sense. 
The world market prices oil according to its opportunity cost. 
The key point is that fundamental economic decisions should not be affected by the ownership of additional foreign oil assets. 
But, because of political pressure exerted by small, powerful interest groups, windfall profits will inevitably be spent at home in unwise subsidies. 
As a result, the acquiring country will, if anything, make suboptimal economic decisions. 
Could the purchase of foreign resources lead to smoother national income? 
A purchase will always look beneficial if one looks backward after the resource price has risen. 
But if the price of oil falls, citizens suffer a loss of income and wealth (relative to having invested the money elsewhere). 
A country’s property rights in foreign oil assets are likely to diminish as the oil price rises. 
It is in this kind of world that seemingly nonsensical behavior like growing grain in the desert to ensure food security begins to make sense. 
Moreover, even in such a bleak world, it is difficult to imagine the market breaking down completely or for long. 
Similarly, the creation of international strategic resource reserves on neutral territory and under neutral management could help alleviate concerns about politically motivated disruptions. 
Unfortunately, all of this requires substantial international political consensus, cooperation, and goodwill – all of which are in short supply today. 
Until we find the collective will, the drive for national economic security will continue to lead to collective insecurity. 
The Service Revolution 
WASHINGTON, DC – China and India are both racing ahead economically. 
But the manner in which they are growing is dramatically different. 
Whereas China is a formidable exporter of manufactured goods, India has acquired a global reputation for exporting modern services. 
Indeed, India has leapfrogged over the manufacturing sector, going straight from agriculture into services. 
The differences in the two countries’ growth patterns are striking, and raise significant questions for development economists. 
Can service be as dynamic as manufacturing? 
Can late-comers to development take advantage of the increasing globalization of the service sector? 
Can services be a driver of sustained growth, job creation, and poverty reduction? 
Some facts are worth examining. 
The relative size of the service sector in India, given the country’s state of development, is much bigger than it is in China. 
Despite being a low-income region, India and other South Asian countries have adopted the growth patterns of middle- to high-income countries. 
Their growth patterns more closely resemble those of Ireland and Israel than those of China and Malaysia. 
As a result of globalization, the pace of development can be explosive. 
But the potential for explosive growth has usually been seen only in the manufacturing sector. 
This is no longer the case. 
There is no outbreak of the so-called “Dutch disease” – that is, the price of services do not fall with an increase in the supply. 
India has a higher share of services, and more rapid service-sector growth, than China, although the latter is richer and has grown faster over time. 
This indicates that services are not simply responding to domestic demand (which would be higher in China), but also to export opportunities. 
India’s growth experience suggests that a global service revolution – rapid growth and poverty reduction led by services – is now possible. 
In India, the service sector has not only led overall economic growth, but is also characterized by higher labor productivity than in the industrial sector. 
Indeed, productivity growth in India’s service sector matches productivity growth in China’s manufacturing sector, thereby reducing poverty by enabling wages to rise. 
Developing countries can thus sustain service-led growth, given the huge room they have for catch-up and convergence. 
India’s experience offers hope to other development late-comers. 
The promise of the service revolution is that countries do not have to wait to get on the path to rapid development. 
There is a new way ahead. 
The Seven-Year Ditch 
PRINCETON – There are historical precedents for sovereign-debt defaults by the countries of Europe’s southern periphery, but they are not instantly attractive ones. 
Dealing with seemingly intractable problems often takes time. 
And it is difficult – especially in a democracy – to be patient. 
The most obvious parallel to Europe’s current woes is the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980’s. 
In August 1982, Mexico threatened to default, and was quickly followed by other large borrowers, notably Argentina and Brazil. 
What followed was a seven-year play for extra time. 
Three years after the outbreak of the Latin American crisis, United States Treasury Secretary James Baker announced a systematization of the initial response. 
The Baker Plan was a universal disappointment. 
Growth faltered again, and the International Monetary Fund actually reduced its lending. 
If creditor banks were unwilling to accept some form of restructuring, they would have to put in new money. 
The lending of the international institutions might also be used for buying back discounted debt. 
Brady’s plan looked like a great success. 
Confidence returned, capital flight from Latin America was reversed, and capital markets became willing to provide financing again. 
Inevitably, the Brady Plan looks like a good model for southern Europe. 
Why not avoid seven years of misery, and begin some similar rescue operation now that could lead to a return to economic vigor and dynamism? 
They needed to fake it for seven years in order to build up adequate reserves against losses. 
The initiative for the Brady Plan did not come from the official sector at all. 
It was the willingness of some large financial institutions to trade in discounted debt that established a market that could clear out the legacy of past mistakes. 
Two institutions, in particular, took the lead: Citicorp in the US and Deutsche Bank in Europe. 
Their CEOs at the time presented their actions as being motivated by far-sighted benevolence and a concern for the well-being of the world as a whole. 
That may have been plausible, but the two banks also wanted to demonstrate publicly that they had better balance sheets than their weaker rivals. 
In Germany, the Dresdner Bank and the Landesbanken could not afford to take such a hit. 
Moreover, despite the obvious “reform fatigue” of Latin American electorates, the debtor countries had engaged in a substantial measure of reform. 
The final move to solve the debt problem came in the aftermath of international currency adjustment. 
One of the problems that had made the crisis more difficult after 1982 was the US dollar’s appreciation. 
Likewise, today’s euro crisis is harder to resolve because of the euro’s strength in currency markets. 
The dollar’s slide after 1985 made the real burden of Latin America’s dollar debt much lighter. 
Calling for a European Brady plan today does not guarantee the necessary conditions for such a plan to succeed. 
On all fronts, there has not been much progress. 
There is certainly plenty of frustration about the implementation of austerity, and no real indication of the long-term sustainability of reform efforts in southern Europe. 
The problems of Europe’s banks are also far from being resolved. 
Recapitalization has not yet reached the point where there are enough strong banks. 
Finally, global uncertainty about currencies stands in the way of a solution. 
The euro’s strength, despite the magnitude of the eurozone’s difficulties, makes an export-led recovery strategy harder to realize. 
The Shadow of Depression 
In the US, we can already see signs that the downturn that started in 2008 is casting its shadow on the future. 
Reputable forecasters – both private and public – have been revising down their estimates of America’s potential long-run GDP. 
And much the same processes and responses are at work – with even greater strength – in Europe. 
The price levels are unlikely to go down. 
Yet the desire to hold assets that avoid the medium-term risks associated with the business cycle has overwhelmed this long-run fundamental risk factor. 
But the risk that the world’s investors currently are trying to avoid by rushing into US, Japanese, and German sovereign debt is not a “fundamental” risk. 
There are no psychological preferences, natural-resource constraints, or technological factors that make investing in private enterprises riskier than it was five years ago. 
Managing aggregate demand is governments’ job. 
But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough.” 
This played a significant role in setting the stage for the two fastest generations of global economic growth the world has ever seen. 
Now the stage has been emptied. 
The Shadow of the Crescent 
Which comes first, flag or faith? 
Some feel that their religion is the most important thing to them, and that that’s where their first loyalty will always lie. 
This willingness to subordinate state to God, even among the highly educated, lies at the heart of Pakistan’s crisis. 
How can a country be expected to prosper if the majority of its citizens harbor only a secondary allegiance to the state? 
How can it progress if, as the noted author M.J. Akbar wrote, “the idea of Pakistan is weaker than the Pakistani.” 
But what is the idea of Pakistan? 
Back in the heady days of the 1940’s, Mohammed Ali Jinnah rallied a people to nationhood. 
Despite his Anglophone status and Victorian manners, he carved out a separate homeland for India’s Muslims. 
For the real Jinnah is now irrelevant in the country that reveres him as “Quaid-e-Azam,” or founder of the nation. 
Few Pakistanis have the time or inclination to think about their founder’s ideas. 
Jinnah’s idea of Pakistan – South Asian Muslim nationalism – has been overrun by the dogma of Islamic universalism. 
The modern Pakistani identity is shaped largely by the negation of an Indian-Hindu identity and the adoption of a global pan-Islamic charter. 
Economic advancement is taken to mean Westernization or worse, Indianization. 
At every turn, Pakistanis seem more likely to unite as brothers in Islam than as sons of the same soil. 
This paranoid Islam, represented by hard-line outfits like the Tablighi Jamaat, is Pakistan’s fastest-growing brand of faith. 
Pakistan is now at a crossroads, facing an uneasy moment of truth. 
Today’s crisis calls for every thinking Pakistani to ask serious questions of themselves: What should be the idea of Pakistan? 
Are you Pakistanis who happen to be Muslims, Christians, or Hindus? 
Or are you members of a global Islamic ummah who just happen to live in Karachi or Lahore? 
The real challenge, and the ultimate solution, is to get people to think and talk about these questions. 
But this must be a debate between people, and within people. 
Nothing will be solved by searching for the “true Islam” or by quoting the Koran. 
The real idea of Pakistan, ultimately, must be multiplicity. 
Today, we have come to understand ourselves as composites; often contradictory and internally incompatible. 
In the Babarnama , for example, we see the internal contradictions in the personality of the founder of the Mughal Empire. 
So who was Babar, bloodthirsty tyrant, humanist poet, or both – and not necessarily at odds with each other? 
That must be the ultimate goal, and step one in the long, winding battle to save Pakistan. 
The Crescent has cast a seemingly interminable shadow across the length of Pakistan. 
Its tragedies and failings are a result of what is happening in God’s name, not Jinnah’s. 
To save Pakistan, Jinnah’s spirit, his moth-eaten ideals, must be renewed, and Pakistanis must ask themselves what Pakistan really means. 
The Shadow Plague 
The XIVth International Conference on AIDS in Barcelona last month put the global HIV epidemic back in the spotlight--justifiably so. 
But the continuing spread of HIV is closely linked with the growing resurgence of a much older killer. 
These latent bacteria can be activated when other factors reduce the body's immunity to infection. 
This is why, over the centuries, poor living conditions, malnutrition, and diabetes always accompanied TB outbreaks. 
The vast majority of TB deaths occur in the developing world--largely induced by HIV. 
Indeed, more than 25% of preventable deaths in developing countries are due to TB. 
The key element in any comprehensive eradication effort is rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious cases. 
The problem is that treatment is too often abandoned at the first signs of clinical improvement - usually after 2-3 months. 
Members of high-risk groups, such as immigrants, the homeless, commercial sex workers, and the poor, are forced to move or search for work. 
In such cases, newly selected drug-resistant bacilli may appear, leaving only second-line drugs that are more toxic and expensive. 
Only 148 out of 211 countries (45% of the world's population), however, are currently implementing it. 
For example, wider use of anti-retroviral treatment in HIV cases can restore immunity and allow TB treatment to act effectively. 
But this is possible only if sufficient technical and financial assistance is channeled to poor countries unable to afford anti-retroviral drugs. 
Developed countries have a clear interest here. 
Western Europe thought it defeated TB in the late 1970s, and dismantled its network of dispensaries. 
Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB revived public concern. 
New control strategies were developed, and surveillance systems were implemented to measure their effectiveness. 
But the quality of TB control is still low in much of the world, and TB is a global disease. 
We cannot control it in one country if there is an outbreak next door. 
These patients often forgo treatment, and communication with them is difficult. 
But donor countries and beneficiaries must first define targets, financial shortfalls, and technical requirements to improve TB control on a global scale. 
That must mean sharing HIV's more notorious spotlight. 
The Shape of America’s Recession 
In principle, the US recession could end up being shaped like a V, U, W, or L. Which of these four scenarios is most likely? 
Most analysts forecast that GDP will contract in the first half of 2008 and recover in the second half of the year. 
First, the US is experiencing its worst housing recession since the Great Depression, and the slump is not over. 
Second, in 2001, weak capital spending in the corporate sector (accounting for 10% of GDP) underpinned the contraction. 
Today, it is private consumption in the household sector (70% of GDP) that is in trouble. 
Third, the US is experiencing its most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
Losses are spreading from sub-prime to near-prime and prime mortgages, commercial mortgages, and unsecured consumer credit (credit cards, auto loans, student loans). 
Given these staggering sums, the US could face a double-dip, W-shaped recession. 
Fortunately, an L-shaped period of protracted economic stagnation – Japan’s experience in the 1990’s – is unlikely. Japan waited almost two years after its asset bubble collapsed to ease monetary policy and provide a fiscal stimulus, whereas in the US both steps came early. 
Many European economies are already slowing, with some entering recession. 
China and Asia are particularly vulnerable, given their trade links to the US. 
And emerging markets will suffer once the US contraction and global slowdown undermines commodity prices. 
The Sick Man of Asia 
But what policymakers and pundits fail to recognise - or refuse to recognise - is that economic policies per se will not reinvigorate Japan. 
Japan's crisis is systemic, not cyclical. 
Debt, deflation and other maladies are purely symptoms of Japan's disease. 
The causes are a combination of institutional sclerosis, social anomie and gerontocratic governance. 
This system rested on three pillars: a cohesive political-industrial establishment, the mobilisation of resources to achieve national economic ends and America's defensive shield. 
Almost immediately after defeat in WWII, Japan metamorphosed from being America's enemy into its pampered protégé. 
This was " real geopolitik " in action. 
The Cold War, the rise of Maoist China, the Korean War all made Japan indispensable to America. 
Japan developed an "outward looking protectionist" strategy and structure. 
Unlike India or Brazil, which opted for inward-looking protectionism, select sectors of Japanese industry actively participated in international markets. 
Far ranging efforts were deployed to obtain technology transfers. 
The domestic market however was protected by a combination of industrial policy, cartels and a "Buy Japanese" mentality. 
As a "catch-up" strategy, it worked fantastically well. 
By the mid-1980s Japan had more than caught up. 
By the late 1980s the world was changing fast, but Japan refused to change. 
The country became characterized by immobility and atavism. 
Japanese institutions were archaic and pursued mistaken economic strategies and structures. 
But the illiberal nationalist ideological ethos that defined Japanese society brooked no genuine debate, let alone heterodox positions. 
Indeed, among Japan's most moribund institutions are its universities and media. 
Not only was there no new leadership, but the seniority system and the omnipresence of "senior advisors" continued to prevail throughout Japanese institutions. 
This ossification was driven by the rigid, conservative and gerontocratic nature of governance. 
Collapse it did, in 1991. 
Policymakers, business leaders, academics and journalists refused to recognize the depth of their country's problems. 
A day of reckoning came with the Kobe earthquake on 17 January 1995. 
It was then that the Japanese people realized that "the emperor" (specifically the government) had no clothes. 
The Japanese have no confidence in the future because the establishment has lost all credibility and legitimacy. 
Strange to say, but the situation may get dramatically worse, not only economically, but also socially. 
There is also a strong extremist political minority and a not-too-difficult to tap latent national chauvinism. 
But a different scenario is possible: a reinvigorated, open post-industrial, globally-oriented Japanese society can be established on liberal political foundations. 
The potential is there; there is a young generation of Japanese who harbour such a vision. 
They need every encouragement, for today's trends are frightening for Japan, for Asia, and for the world. 
The Silence of China's Intellectuals 
Public opinion, as the crisis over the US spy plane demonstrated, now matters in China. 
But where do China’s intellectuals stand and what role do they play? 
In the 1980s traditional Chinese respect for education was revived after the scourge of the Mao years. 
Both works – and others of the 1980s – mesmerized the public. 
Yet, at a time when an intellectual's conscience might seem most useful – they were inaudible. 
Why? 
Repression is one reason. 
Moreover, most of China's leading public intellectuals of the 1980s fled the country after 1989. 
A new generation of intellectual leaders needed time to emerge. 
Falun Gong boomed, as did Christianity and other religions. Some people embraced nationalism and chauvinism. 
Contemporary intellectuals embraced all these trends. 
State-sponsored repression, however, only partially explains the silence since 1989. 
Urban China's rapid economic growth also shaped intellectual life. 
The social and economic status of better-off intellectuals is second only to Communist officials and the new super-rich. 
New subcultures, and even publications flourish so long as they avoid politically sensitive subjects. 
In short, personal comfort resulted in political timidity and complacency. 
Regardless of how wealth was acquired, they wonder if society can accept the grotesque disparities that resulted? 
These questions create an awkward dilemma for intellectuals who favor opening to the West. 
So, do you call for more Westernization or less? 
Will membership in the World Trade Organization do more harm or good? 
Is more Western pop culture advisable? 
A diverse, confusing spectrum of muted views has resulted. 
A "new left" embraces the poor, but wants to remain distinct from the authoritarian "old left." 
Liberals have grown their own left and right wings – mainly over the issue of social justice versus political freedom. 
The main issues back then – "more reform" and "more opening to the West" – were not freighted with ambiguity and controversy. 
So, the "silence" of Chinese intellectuals has several causes, and is in part illusory. 
Unfortunately, China's leaders, deeply unsure of themselves, are in no mood to accept advice. 
Late last year a publishing ban was imposed on ten leading intellectuals. Several were fired from state-sponsored jobs. 
Defiance, indeed, is now the exception rather than the rule. 
But the government still is unwilling to listen. 
The Silver Lining in High Commodity Prices 
The United States’ ill-considered bio-fuels subsidy program demonstrates how not to react. 
Never mind that this is hugely inefficient in terms of water and land usage. 
Another wrong turn is the proposal recently embraced by two American presidential candidates to temporarily scrap taxes on gasoline. 
As laudable as it may be to help low-income drivers deal with soaring fuel costs, this is not the way to do it. 
The gas tax should be raised , not lowered. 
Of course, it is not just oil prices that are high, but all commodity prices, from metals to food to lumber. 
Oil prices have risen almost 400% in the last five years. 
The proximate cause is a global economic boom that has been stronger, longer, and more broad-based than any in modern history. 
Asia has led the way, but the past five years have been the best Latin American and Africa have enjoyed in decades. 
Some politicians also complain about speculators who, more and more, are trading commodities on complex and growing markets that allow them to bet on whether, say, future demand from emerging markets is likely to outstrip growth in future supply. 
If “speculators” are bidding up today’s commodity prices because they realize that future generations are going to want commodities, too, isn’t that a healthy development? 
High prices for commodities today mean more supply for future generations, while at the same time creating an incentive to develop new ways to conserve on consumption. 
Again, high prices are helping in ways that Western politicians seem afraid to contemplate. 
The end to Western consumerism is not yet at hand, but high commodity prices are a clear warning that big adjustments will be needed as Asia and other emerging nations begin to consume a larger share of the global pie. 
True, when today’s global economic boom ends, as it inevitably will, commodity prices will plummet, easily 25%, quite possibly 50% or more. 
Western politicians will cheer, and many pundits will express relief that less money will be flowing to undemocratic countries in the developing world. 
But today’s era of high commodity prices is not just a bad dream that should be forgotten when it ends. 
The Sinai Powder Keg 
TEL AVIV– The crisis in the Sinai Peninsula seems to have been dwarfed by Sunday’s drama in Cairo. 
But Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s civilian coup, in which he dismissed General Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the leader of the army’s supreme command, has not diminished the importance of the trouble there. 
Earlier this month, jihadi terrorists ambushed an Egyptian military base in Sinai, killing 16 Egyptian soldiers. 
They then hijacked two armored personnel carriers and sped toward the frontier with Israel. 
One vehicle failed to break through the border crossing; the other penetrated Israeli territory, before being stopped by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). 
Indeed, since Hosni Mubarak’s ouster last year, security in Sinai has deteriorated, and the region has become fertile ground for Islamic extremism. 
The 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty mandated that Sinai be largely demilitarized in order to serve as a buffer zone between the two former enemies. 
Tourism and natural-gas pipelines linking the two countries provided economic resources for the local Bedouin. 
But, as Mubarak’s regime declined, so did the government’s control over the Bedouin. 
Now the behavior of his successors from the military and the Muslim Brotherhood has revived security challenges and raised difficult questions about the region’s future. 
For example, in August 2011, a jihadi group from Gaza seized control of an Egyptian outpost on Israel’s border and killed eight Israeli civilians. 
The Egyptian security forces’ subsequent failure to prevent demonstrators from storming Israel’s embassy in Cairo brought matters to the brink of calamity. 
The uncertainty and disorder that have plagued Egypt for the last 18 months are fueling increasing lawlessness in Sinai. 
There are four principal actors in this arena: Israel, Egypt, Hamas, and the Sinai jihadis. 
Israel wants, first and foremost, peace and stability. 
Israel is determined not to act against terrorist groups and infrastructure on Egypt’s territory. 
But Egypt’s divided government has not established a correspondingly coherent policy. 
For them, the lawless Bedouin, the Sinai jihadis, and Hamas and other groups in Gaza threaten Egypt’s national security. 
But their will and ability to translate this view into policy are limited. 
Meanwhile, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are playing a double game. 
In fact, Hamas, too, is playing a double game. 
Having lost Syrian backing, it is hoping that the Egyptian Brothers will provide its kindred movement with political and logistical support. 
Yet it allows radical Palestinians and jihadi groups in Gaza to conduct operations in Sinai. 
While this group’s primary goal is to undermine Israel-Egypt relations, they do not shy away from operating directly against the Egyptian state. 
Given their strategic location, Sinai jihadis could easily be used by larger terrorist networks to target strategically vital locations, such as the Suez Canal. 
Egypt’s government was humiliated and incensed by the recent terrorist provocation. 
It is also too early to tell whether Morsi’s shakeup in Cairo was related to, or expedited by, the Sinai events. 
But Sinai’s explosive potential clearly has been increased by the Muslim Brotherhood’s takeover. 
Israel’s longstanding channel of communication with Egypt through the military has disappeared, and may or may not be replaced by a similar channel. 
Hamas and the Bedouins in Sinai have most likely been emboldened by the latest developments in Cairo. 
The Single Mother Makeover 
Murphy Brown, played by actress Candice Bergen, was a TV anomaly at that time: a sympathetically portrayed single mother. 
So Bush’s vice president, Dan Quayle, attacked the show for normalizing rather than stigmatizing single motherhood. 
Much hand-wringing followed, with single mothers (never, at that time, single fathers) cast as harbingers of doom for core American values. 
How times have changed. 
The tale of Sarah Palin’s daughter, Bristol, has also been spun as a tale of an admirable single mother and a loser father. When they split up, the story line cast the heroic young mother against what was often depicted as the beer-drinking, immature dad. 
Even Jennifer Aniston, whom Brad Pitt left because she did not want kids, now sighs in interviews, as she nears 42, that she has stopped waiting for Prince Charming, and that she, too, could be ready to adopt and go it alone. 
The 1990’s produced a demeaning narrative of women waiting in frustration as their “biological clocks” ticked, cursing themselves for putting career first at the expense of finding Mr. Right and having children. 
At some point, women became powerful enough that they collectively rejected the high social value this narrative placed on a male offer of a ring and flipped the stereotype on its head. 
Glamorizing single motherhood is not realistic, but it allows female pop culture to express a revenge fantasy at all the potential husbands and fathers who walked away, or who were not the dream husband and father after all, or who wanted the sex but not the kids and the tuition bills. 
This trend hardly signifies the end of civilization as we know it; all things being equal, most women would still prefer the simple fantasy of a supportive partner in childrearing. 
But the new image of single mothers – and of single motherhood – does show that it is getting harder – if not almost impossible – to coerce women by trying to fix upon them the scarlet letter. 
The Sino-Indian Water Divide 
Their underlying strategic dissonance and rivalry, however, usually attracts less notice. 
As its power grows, China seems determined to choke off Asian competitors, a tendency reflected in its hardening stance toward India. 
The issues that divide India and China, however, extend beyond territorial disputes. 
Water is becoming a key security issue in Sino-Indian relations and a potential source of enduring discord. 
China and India already are water-stressed economies. 
The spread of irrigated farming and water-intensive industries, together with the demands of a rising middle class, have led to a severe struggle for more water. 
Even though India has more arable land than China – 160.5 million hectares compared to 137.1 million hectares – Tibet is the source of most major Indian rivers. 
The Tibetan plateau’s vast glaciers, huge underground springs and high altitude make Tibet the world’s largest freshwater repository after the polar icecaps. 
Indeed, all of Asia’s major rivers, except the Ganges, originate in the Tibetan plateau. 
Even the Ganges’ two main tributaries flow in from Tibet. 
Before such hydro-engineering projects sow the seeds of water conflict, China ought to build institutionalized, cooperative river-basin arrangements with downstream states. 
Even denial of hydrological data in a critically important season can amount to the use of water as a political tool. 
Such leverage could in turn prompt a downstream state to build up its military capacity to help counterbalance this disadvantage. 
In fact, China has been damming most international rivers flowing out of Tibet, whose fragile ecosystem is already threatened by global warming. 
Local authorities in Yunnan province, however, are considering damming the Salween in the quake-prone upstream region. 
But even a joint expert-level mechanism – set up in 2007 merely for “interaction and cooperation” on hydrological data – has proven of little value. 
Diversion of the Brahmaputra’s water to the parched Yellow river is an idea that China does not discuss in public, because the project implies environmental devastation of India’s northeastern plains and eastern Bangladesh, and would thus be akin to a declaration of water war on India and Bangladesh. 
The issue now is not whether China will reroute the Brahmaputra, but when. 
Once authorities complete their feasibility studies and the diversion scheme begins, the project will be presented as a fait accompli . 
China already has identified the bend where the Brahmaputra forms the world’s longest and deepest canyon – just before entering India – as the diversion point. 
Tibet ceased to be a political buffer when China annexed it nearly six decades ago. 
But Tibet can still become a political bridge between China and India. 
For that to happen, water has to become a source of cooperation, not conflict. 
Nationalism, Madness, and Terrorism 
Several new phenomena appeared in sixteenth-century England that revolutionized human experience. 
English society was redefined as a “nation” – that is, a sovereign community of equal members. 
With that, the era of nationalism began, and social mobility became legitimate. 
At the same time, a special variety of mental illness was first observed, which we would later call schizophrenia and depressive disorders – different from a multitude of mental illnesses already known. 
Madness expressed itself in degrees of mental impairment, the common symptoms of which were chronic discomfort in one’s environment (social maladjustment), uncertainty about oneself, oscillation between self-loathing and megalomania, and sometimes a complete loss of identity. 
It was nationalism that legitimated mobility; the two of them together that produced madness; and the new mental disease that expressed itself in suicide and irrational violence. 
Nationalism implied a specific image of society and reality in general – a consciousness that was to become the cultural framework of modernity. 
In its original, English, form it was essentially democratic. 
As it spread, it carried the seeds of democracy everywhere. 
National consciousness, dramatically different from the fundamentally religious, hierarchical consciousness that it replaced, shapes how we live today. 
Nationalist principles emphasize the self-governing individual, including the right to choose one’s social position and identity. 
But this liberty, empowering and encouraging the individual to choose what to be, complicates identity formation. 
A member of a nation cannot learn who or what s/he is from the environment, as would an individual in a religious and rigidly stratified social order, in which everyone’s position and behavior is defined by birth and divine providence. 
By providing inconsistent guidance (for we are inevitably guided by our cultural environment), nationalism actively disorients us – a cultural insufficiency called anomie. 
The more choices for the definition of one’s identity that a society offers – and the more insistent it is on equality – the more problematic the formation of identity in it becomes. 
Most examples of violent crime by mentally ill people were committed first in England, and then in the US, often seeming politically motivated, even when mediated by religion. 
He was to be questioned to divulge the names of his co-conspirators and then executed. 
But it was quickly revealed, instead, that he was suffering from a “nawghtye mallenchollye.” 
It was as natural for an Elizabethan Protestant to see the cause of his mental discomfort in a government overrun by Catholic sympathizers as it is for someone with a Muslim connection in the US today to see this cause in America as the embodiment of Western offenses against the faith. 
Blaming one’s existential discomfort on external factors is a kind of self-therapy. 
The Sixty-Year Storm 
It is a much bigger storm than any that has occurred since the end of World War II. 
To understand what is happening, we need a new paradigm. 
It is available in the theory of reflexivity, which I first proposed 20 years ago in my book The Alchemy of Finance . 
The theory holds that financial markets do not tend towards equilibrium. 
Left to their own devices, markets are prone to extremes of euphoria and despair. 
But the authorities are also human and subject to biased views and misconceptions. 
And the interaction between financial markets and financial authorities is also reflexive. 
The recent US housing boom is a case in point. 
But the 60-year super-boom is a more complicated case. 
Every time the credit expansion ran into trouble, the financial authorities intervened, injecting liquidity and finding other ways to stimulate the economy. 
That created a system of asymmetric incentives – also know as moral hazard – which encouraged ever greater credit expansion. 
Fundamentalists believe that markets tend towards equilibrium and the common interest is best served by allowing participants to pursue their self-interest. 
Nevertheless, market fundamentalism emerged as the dominant ideology in the 1980s, when financial markets started to become globalized and the US began running a current account deficit. 
Since 1980, regulations have been progressively relaxed until they practically disappeared. 
The financial markets encouraged consumers to borrow by introducing ever more sophisticated instruments and more generous terms. 
The authorities aided and abetted the process by intervening whenever the global financial system was at risk. 
Similarly, the rating agencies relied on information provided by the originators of synthetic products. 
It was a shocking abdication of responsibility. 
Everything that could go wrong did. 
Investment banks’ commitments to leveraged buyouts became liabilities. 
Market-neutral hedge funds turned out not to be market-neutral and had to be unwound. 
That made the crisis more severe than any since World War II. 
Credit expansion must now be followed by a period of contraction, because some of the new credit instruments and practices are unsound and unsustainable. 
Moreover, the ability of the financial authorities to stimulate the economy is constrained by the unwillingness of the rest of the world to accumulate additional dollar reserves. 
Now, they must recognize that the Fed may no longer be in a position to do so. 
With oil, food and other commodities firm, and the renminbi appreciating somewhat faster, the Fed also has to worry about inflation. 
If interest rates were lowered beyond a certain point, the dollar would come under renewed pressure and long-term bonds would actually go up in yield. 
It is impossible to determine where that point is, but when it is reached, the Fed’s ability to stimulate the economy comes to an end. 
Although a recession in the developed world is now more or less inevitable, China, India, and some of the oil-producing countries are in a very strong countertrend. 
The Skills Deficit 
The slowdown has predictably led to calls for further fiscal and monetary stimulus. 
A longer-term view is required, because the US is facing a structural-adjustment challenge that will be accompanied by high unemployment. 
Like Southern Europe, the US economy must move away from the consumption/housing-led growth model of the last decade. 
But this is easier said than done. 
Unemployment remained low because the booming domestic economy created enough jobs in services and construction. 
Reversing this shift quickly seems impossible. 
Most construction workers are rather low-skilled and thus cannot be re-deployed to modern high-tech manufacturing. 
The same applies to real-estate agents, social workers, and managers of credit-card accounts. 
Unfortunately, there is very little that economic policy can do to create a strong exporting sector in the short run, except alleviate the social pain. 
Labor-market flexibility is always touted as a panacea, but even the highest degree of it cannot transform unemployed realtors or construction workers into skilled manufacturing specialists. 
Experience has also shown that retraining programs have only limited success. 
Ironically, Germany might provide the most useful template for the problems facing US policymakers. 
Germany experienced a consumption and construction boom after unification, with full employment and a current-account deficit. 
After the boom peaked in 1995, one million construction workers were laid off and could not find jobs elsewhere. 
The German economy faced a decade of high unemployment and slow growth. 
But it still took more than ten years for Germany to become the export powerhouse of today. 
It is unlikely that the adjustment process will be much faster in the US, where the manufacturing base has shrunk much more sharply. 
By contrast, the US dollar is tied to the renminbi, whose issuer – China – has the world’s largest and fastest-growing export sector. 
How long will the US adjustment take? 
Since the peak of the bubble, the US economy has not even been moving in the right direction. 
So long as this trend continues, only high and continuing doses of fiscal and monetary expansion will be able to sustain domestic demand. 
A self-sustaining recovery is, of course, possible, but it presupposes a massive structural adjustment aimed at restoring US competitiveness in global markets. 
The Sleeping Volcano of Global Finance 
And there cannot be a stable economic order – at least not in democratic countries – if electorates reject its underpinnings. 
Capitalism could be reconstructed after World War II because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation: social security, which served as a principal stabilizer, at least in the developed countries; 
But the realignment of the rich, developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists like Milton Friedman, which began around 1970, broke with all that. 
Not long after, the dollar was detached from the gold standard. 
Ever since, the international financial system has endured almost constant instability. 
Crises have multiplied, with each seemingly worse than the one that came before. 
Throughout the rich world, poverty has come roaring back. 
Internal and international inequalities have been increasing at breakneck speed. 
Employment is increasingly precariousness. And where unemployment is preferred to universal job insecurity, it has become impossible to suppress. 
It is to this state of affairs that the French and Dutch said “no” two months ago. 
Paradoxically, however, a united Europe is likely to be needed even more in the near future than it was in the past. After all, beyond the social misery produced by the re-institutionalized cruelty of the current global economic system, the greatest danger facing the world nowadays is that very system’s inherent instability. 
I don’t see any institution other than the EU that has enough size and heft to protect Europeans from a possible implosion. 
The United States cannot function without being able to borrow $1.9 billion dollars each and every day of the year, mainly from the emerging economies of Asia, and China above all. 
But this support could weaken or even cease if the dollar falls too low, if the price of oil rises too high, or if the American economy backfires. 
Its manufacturing sector now accounts for a mere 11% of America’s GDP. 
Ford and General Motors are in dire financial straits. 
Meanwhile, two speculative bubbles – in the real estate market and in mortgages – have become grafted upon each other and now dominate economic activity in the US. 
A crash, or at least a sharp spasm, is quite likely in the near future, and the consequences – for America and the world – may be catastrophic. 
This instability also makes it difficult to address other grave problems affecting the global financial system. 
The absence of a lender of last resort in today’s world only magnifies the threat involved in each crisis. 
To make matters worse, national failures can no longer be addressed without aggravating the situation. 
Of course – indeed, above all – in such circumstances the immense investments needed to overcome underdevelopment and the disabilities that it entails are increasingly forgotten by the world of international finance. 
With rich countries threatened by instability and poor countries largely left to their own devices, the reconstruction of the world financial system should be at the top of the international agenda. 
Five Years in Limbo 
Financial deregulation – together with easy money – had contributed to excessive risk-taking. 
Monetary policy would be relatively ineffective in reviving the economy, even if still-easier money might prevent the financial system’s total collapse. 
Thus, greater reliance on fiscal policy – increased government spending – would be necessary. 
In many EU countries, GDP remains lower, or insignificantly above, pre-recession levels. 
Almost 27 million Europeans are unemployed. 
Similarly, 22 million Americans who would like a full-time job cannot find one. 
Most Americans’ income and wealth are below their levels long before the crisis. 
Indeed, a typical full-time male worker’s income is lower than it has been in more than four decades. 
Yes, we have done some things to improve financial markets. 
There have been some increases in capital requirements – but far short of what is needed. 
Likewise, some of the predatory and discriminatory lending and abusive credit-card practices have been curbed; but equally exploitive practices continue. 
The working poor still are too often exploited by usurious payday loans. 
These are, quite simply, taxes, with the revenues enriching private coffers rather than serving public purposes. 
Other problems have gone unaddressed – and some have worsened. 
The credit ratings agencies have been held accountable in two private suits. 
But here, too, what they have paid is but a fraction of the losses that their actions caused. 
Bankers boast of having paid back in full the government bailout funds that they received when the crisis erupted. 
Nor do they mention the costs imposed on the rest of the economy – a cumulative output loss in Europe and the US that is well in excess of $5 trillion. 
Meanwhile, those who argued that monetary policy would not suffice turned out to have been right. 
Yes, we were all Keynesians – but all too briefly. 
Fiscal stimulus was replaced by austerity, with predictable – and predicted – adverse effects on economic performance. 
Some in Europe are pleased that the economy may have bottomed out. 
With a return to output growth, the recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction – is officially over. 
The financial system may be more stable than it was five years ago, but that is a low bar – back then, it was teetering on the edge of a precipice. 
The glass is, at most, only one-quarter full; for most people, it is three-quarters empty. 
The Smartest Ways to Save the World 
That is the question that I posed to a panel of five top economists, including four Nobel laureates, in the Copenhagen Consensus 2012 project. 
The panel members were chosen for their expertise in prioritization and their ability to use economic principles to compare policy choices. 
Over the past year, more than 50 economists prepared research on nearly 40 investment proposals in areas ranging from armed conflicts and natural disasters to hunger, education, and global warming. 
The teams that drafted each paper identified the costs and benefits of the smartest ways to spend money within their area. 
In early May, many of them traveled to Denmark to convince the expert panel of the power of their investment proposals. 
The single most important investment, according to the panel, would step up the fight against malnutrition. 
In total, such an investment would help more than 100 million children to start their lives without stunted growth or malnourishment. 
Studies show that, decades down the line, these children would be more productive, make more money, have fewer kids, and begin a virtuous circle of dramatic development. 
Such opportunities come sharply into focus when you ask some of the world’s best minds to find the biggest bang for the buck. 
Micronutrient provision is rarely celebrated, but it makes a world of difference. 
Later this year, donors will decide whether to renew this facility. 
The panel’s findings should help to persuade them to do so. 
For a similar amount, 300 million children could be dewormed in schools. 
Expanding tuberculosis treatment and childhood immunization coverage are two other health investments that the expert panel endorses. 
Likewise, a $100 million annual increase in spending to develop a vaccine against HIV/AIDS would generate substantial benefits in the future. 
Getting low-cost drugs for acute heart attacks to developing countries would cost just $200 million, and prevent 300,000 deaths. 
The expert panel’s findings point to a compelling need to invest roughly $2 billion annually in research and development to increase agricultural output. 
That, in turn, would help in the fight against climate change, because forests store carbon. 
This would allow us to understand better the technology’s risks, costs, and benefits. 
Moreover, the research could potentially give us low-cost, effective insurance against global warming. 
Another priority for investment is the establishment of effective early-warning systems for natural disasters in developing countries. 
For less than $1 billion a year, this would alleviate both direct and long-term economic damage, possibly securing some $35 billion in benefits. 
The expert panel’s list shows us that there are many smart solutions waiting to be implemented. 
The Social Brain 
Imitation, as the saying goes, is the sincerest form of flattery. 
But it even seems to form the heart of our humanity. 
Indeed, imitation appears to be a vital key to understanding human development, from behavior and language to empathy and social skills. 
Compared with most other species, human beings are so immature at birth that they require an exceptionally long period of nursing and shelter. 
We spend our long infancy and childhood adapting to the widely varying and complex sociocultural environment that surrounds us. 
This allows us to interact and operate successfully within our environment throughout our lives. 
From the outset, even before we develop the ability to use spoken language, nonverbal communication drastically shapes our personality and sense of self. 
Children learn by watching adults and other children, developing important skills under continuous social feedback. 
This feedback enables proper production and, later, understanding, of emotion-related facial expressions that the subject herself cannot see. 
Fortunately for human development, healthy children find imitation enormously gratifying. 
They enjoy both imitating and being imitated. 
Imitation is so essential to mastering basic social skills and transferring cultural knowledge that it is likely to have an organic basis in the brain. 
Brain imaging studies have now shown that the human brain contains a similar mirror-neuron system (MNS). 
One can copy movements and motor acts without understanding their meaning. 
This happens when a flock of geese suddenly takes flight from a lake, "blindly" following the flock's first frightened member. 
Humans compute other people's intentions and emotions continuously, constantly observing their movements, postures, and gaze. 
These mind-reading skills are essential for successful social interaction. 
Broca's region is the human counterpart of the monkey mirror-neuron area. 
As both human and monkey mirror neurons code hand manipulation and facial gestures, some interesting hypotheses have emerged. 
In humans, Broca's region is found in the left brain hemisphere, whose dominance for speech is well known. 
Behavioral studies, too, have shown that gesturing is closely related to speech production. 
To take a familiar example, we gesture even while speaking on the telephone, when others cannot see us. 
Indeed, congenitally blind persons gesture--even while speaking with people they know to be blind as well! 
This leads to an obvious question: how do we know that we actually performed a motor act rather than only seeing it? 
For most people, physical feedback provided by muscle and tendon sensors helps in resolving this, as does proper communication between brain areas. 
But misattribution of one's own acts does, in fact, occur in some psychiatric disorders. 
Other disorders are associated with defective imitation skills. 
For example, autistic individuals imitate others less and in a different manner than healthy subjects. 
They also have poor mind-reading skills. 
Some patients, by contrast, suffer at the opposite extreme of dysfunction. 
They "echo," imitating almost all movements of other people. 
Perhaps most intriguing, the MNS could provide a platform for mental simulation of future actions--one's own and those of others. 
New imaging tools enable us to study these and other questions about human brain function more productively than ever before. 
In these studies, neurologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, and behavioral researchers all contribute to realizing their common interest in discovering how the human brain operates. 
Brain imaging, combined with the new conceptual framework implied by research on the mirror-neuron system, promises to uncover a more holistic "social" brain. 
This brain's functions and dysfunctions--its very structure--will broaden dramatically our understanding of the relationship between the self and others. 
The Social Dimensions of Globalization 
The ILO is a tripartite organization with representatives of labor, government, and business. 
Consider two issues that have been part of recent bilateral trade agreements pushed aggressively by the Bush administration. 
Even the IMF now recognizes that capital market liberalization has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries. 
These provisions restricted countries from making generic imitations of drugs, making many critically important medicines unaffordable in developing countries. 
Spearheaded by worries about AIDS, activists around the world demanded that something be done. 
Just before last year's trade talks in Cancun, the US made some concessions, so that it was no longer the only holdout. 
Bilateral agreements form the basis of enhanced ties of friendship between countries. 
In still other areas, the Commission's report argues for more "balanced" perspectives. 
As this example shows, bringing different voices to the table in discussions of globalization brings new perspectives. 
Until now, the main worry for most experts on globalization has been excessive government intervention in the economy. 
The Commission fears just the opposite. 
The way that globalization has been managed, however, has eroded the ability of the state to play its proper role. 
At the root of this problem is the global political system - if such it can be called. 
This is a message the world would do well to heed, lest discontent with globalization continue to grow. 
The Soft Power of the United Nations 
They are mistaken. 
Power is the ability to affect others to produce the outcomes one wants. 
Hard power works through payments and coercion (carrots and sticks); soft power works through attraction and co-option. 
It was created in 1945 to be the servant of its member states, and Article 2.7 of its charter protects the sovereign jurisdiction of its members. 
When the great powers agreed, the UN had impressive hard power, as demonstrated in the Korean War and the first Gulf War. 
But such cases were exceptional. 
During the Cold War, the Council was divided. 
People do not live wholly by the word, but neither do they live solely by the sword. 
Some American leaders then tried to de-legitimize the UN and called for an alternative alliance of democracies. 
The greatest damage to the UN’s legitimacy has been self-inflicted. 
Likewise, administrative inefficiency has led to poor performance of high-profile efforts like the oil-for-food program. 
But such innovations have their limits. 
Moreover, governments have found ways to delay effective international action, as has been the case in Sudan. 
It remains to be see whether China, concerned that its oil trade with Sudan might jeopardize the 2008 Olympics, will decide to exert more pressure. 
Many developing countries, in particular, remain jealous of their sovereignty and fear that the new principle could infringe it. 
It has modest but useful soft power when great powers disagree but are willing to acquiesce in a course of action. 
In such cases, it makes no sense to blame the UN. 
Soft power is real, but it has its limits. 
The fault lies not with the UN, but with the lack of consensus among member states. 
The Soft Underbelly of China’s Growth 
China’s explosive economic growth hinges on the rest of the world, radically changing the global production chain and challenging the global trading system. 
If China maintains its growth momentum over the next two decades, the global system will face huge challenges. 
Indeed, the question is not so much whether the global system will endure the imbalances spawned by China, but how severe those imbalances will prove to be. 
In fact, even as China’s economy has boomed over the past decade, structural adjustment in its domestic sectors slowed, mainly owing to political constraints. 
The banking system remains unhealthy and fragile; capital markets are dying. 
The private sector’s growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes. 
For years, as optimists see it, China has been the world’s cheap assembly shop for shoes, clothing, and microwave ovens. 
Now, it is laying the groundwork to become a global power in more sophisticated, technology-intensive industries. 
Billions of dollars are flowing into auto, steel, chemical, and high-tech electronics plants, setting the stage for China to be a major exporter of high-end products. 
Postponing structural reforms eventually constrains any economy’s performance, as we saw in Japan in the 1980’s and 1990’s. 
Given China’s size and its rising share in the global market, macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials. 
This may explain the growing efforts of Chinese businesses in recent years to go global themselves. 
Globalization is increasingly viewed as an alternative to domestic structural complexity. 
This strategy will exact a heavy price, just as it did in Japan twenty years ago. 
China has much to gain by avoiding such a strategy. 
In economic terms, China has no choice: it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two. 
Above all, truly secure and sustainable economic development requires that it build a large consumer base at home. 
But China’s long-term interest, and that of the world, requires that it get serious about domestic structural reform. 
The Soft Underbelly of Europe's "Hard Core" 
France and Germany used to see themselves as the European Union's "hard core," surrounded by concentric circles of less committed partners. 
Today, however, that Franco-German couple looks more like Europe's soft underbelly. 
The motor has turned into a brake. 
Their perceived claim to speak for Europe antagonized much of the Union. 
A European "hard core" is not an end in itself. 
Its raison d'être is to overcome national selfishness and to set a good example. 
If guided by the spirit of multilateralism, the Franco-German pair pulls Europe together. 
But this is precisely what France and Germany now refrain from doing in many fields of European integration. 
Now, the agreement underpinning Europe's single currency, the euro, has come under Franco-German attack. 
The European Central Bank has indicated that the Pact's collapse could force up Euroland interest rates. 
Germany's behavior is particularly galling, as it had been the strongest advocate of the Stability Pact. 
Abiding by European rules should go without saying, even if that means adopting unpopular austerity measures at home. 
What is at stake for Germany is not simply its reputation as a source of economic dynamism and an anchor of monetary stability within the EU. 
If a choice had to be made, Germany gave America priority over France. 
Gaullism, or the vision of a French-led European counterweight to the US, has never been an option for Germany. 
Neither, to be sure, has the Euro-skeptic British version of Atlanticism. 
As for the euro, the Germans have to accept that if they want to remain good Europeans, they have to get their own fiscal house in order. 
For whatever they do or refrain from doing in terms of domestic reforms affects their partners. 
The best solution for Europe would be an inner circle consisting of France, Germany, and Britain, at least. 
Together, these three countries represent the complete diversity of foreign policy traditions that one can find in the future 25-member EU. 
Trying to pool these traditions may look like trying to square a circle. 
But the alternative is a European Disunion that no one will take seriously as a player in world politics. 
That is an outcome that no true European believer in France and Germany should be prepared to countenance. 
The Software of Life 
Being alive, we tend to think that life is easy to grasp. 
In the accepted classification of sciences, mathematics is thought to be the queen, and the most difficult to grasp, followed by physics, chemistry, and, finally, biology. 
But this scientific hierarchy is false and misleading: we now know that biology contains more mathematics than we ever imagined. 
Then, with recognition of the abstract schemas dictating how genes are expressed, biology climbed even closer to mathematics. 
Today’s buzzword in the study of life is “systems” biology. 
The epigeneticist view was clearly wrong, because something stable had to be transmitted across generations. 
What had to be transmitted was not the final organism, but the recipe to make it. 
When computer programming became widespread, pieces of software were found to behave the same way, and were thus called “viruses.” 
This required only the physical separation of the symbols (visualized as a tape) handled by the machine and the machine itself. 
Moreover, the tape carried the data that allowed the machine to proceed. 
Genetic engineering rests on the manipulation of DNA molecules (whether real or artificially constructed) in order to reprogram foreign cells. 
As a result, many bacteria today produce human proteins. 
But this represents only a small part of the genetic program. 
Transfer of genes between organisms is widespread. 
Nuclear cloning, illustrated by the sheep Dolly, has made the Universal Turing Machine a highly revealing, if not all explaining, model of the cell. 
If we take this metaphor at face value, there is a surprising consequence. 
It has been shown that, the outcome of some computer programs is at once entirely deterministic, innovative, and unpredictable. 
Life is inherently creative. 
However, the metaphor is limited by a simple fact: computers do not make computers. 
The challenge for the new biology is to understand how they would. 
The Solid but Regrettable Argument for Israel's Security Fence 
The International Court of Justice has completed its hearings on the legality of the barrier Israel is building in the occupied West Bank. 
This is an isolated question among many larger issues that await a negotiated peace agreement. 
Who has the right to what land? 
Do Palestinian refugees and their descendants have a right to go back to what is now Israel? 
Do Jews have a right to settle in the West Bank? 
Even so, now that the issue has been put before the Court, it must be discussed. 
Although the world expects a negative decision, Israel can in fact muster a sound legal case. 
If the fence followed the 1967 boundary there would be few objections. 
There is something clearly wrong with that argument. 
As a political matter, I oppose the settlements. 
Most, if not all, of them will have to come down in the ultimate compromise that will emerge someday. 
But the argument about legality is more complicated. 
Suppose that in this limited sense the settlements are unlawful. 
Does that mean that the settlers are sitting ducks who can be attacked with impunity and have no right to defend themselves? 
To say yes is to subscribe to a curious concept of collective responsibility. 
Their motives are too diverse to be reduced to any single stereotype. 
Indeed, some settlements are more than 25 years old and many settlers are a second or third generation of people living in the region. 
Are they, as well as children brought there by their parents, collectively guilty just because some government officials might have violated the Rome Statute since July 2002? 
So if the settlers have a right to self‑defense, is the fence an acceptable means of realizing that right? 
Although it imposes hardships on others, the fence is a plausible means of protection against suicide bombers. 
It is neither disproportionate nor excessive. 
The best argument that the Palestinians could make against the fence is to make it unnecessary by suppressing suicide bombings. 
Someday, Israel's adversaries will abandon their policy of homicidal self‑destruction. 
When they do, there will be a very good legal and moral case for the fence to come down.
