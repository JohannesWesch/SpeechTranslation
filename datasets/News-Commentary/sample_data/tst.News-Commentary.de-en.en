But such a debate also demands an organizational framework to engage European civil society, national parliaments, and pan-European mass media. 
Democracy carries certain costs, but they are always lower than the costs of evading popular participation. 
Only a new European debate that embodies the common action of European citizens and institutions can combat “alter-Europeanism” effectively. 
The time may not have come for a true European constitution, but confronting, rather than evading, the fundamental issues that the EU faces could create the proper context for reviving the constitutional treaty and preparing the Union for the challenges of our time. 
The Racism of the Welfare State 
One is Europe's aging population. The other is the flow of immigrants from soon-to-be new member countries in the European Union and from outside the union. 
In our recent book Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe: A World of Difference , Edward Glaeser and I discuss why the welfare state is so much more generous in Europe than in the US. 
One important explanation is the much larger racial heterogeneity to be found in the US relative to the more homogeneous Continental Western Europe. 
Consider this: according to the World Value Survey, whereas 60% of Americans believe that the poor are "lazy," only 26% of Europeans hold this belief. 
Not surprisingly, those who adhere to such beliefs are more averse to redistribution and welfare, and evidence shows that in the US, those who express more "anti-minority" points of view are also more averse to redistribution and more likely to have less sympathy for the poor. 
It seems easier for white middle class Americans to consider the poor less worthy of government support if they think of them as different. 
To put it crudely, but candidly, indifference comes easy if the poor are assumed to be mostly "black." 
This is more difficult in Norway, where rich and poor are white, often blond and tall. 
Much experimental and statistical evidence shows that individuals trust and associate more with others of the same race. 
Precisely for this reason, political opportunists in the US have long used the race card to discredit welfare and redistribution, from the Jim Crow system that segregated blacks in the South before 1964 to the infamous Reagan-era charge about black "welfare queens" who drive Cadillacs. 
Right wing white politicians, predisposed against taxes and redistribution, use the race issue to secure the votes of poor whites, who otherwise might vote differently on purely economic grounds. 
Even more fundamentally, racial considerations also influence the nature of America's political institutions. 
Proportional representation, widely adopted in Europe in the first decades of the 20th century, was never embraced by the US because it is a system that would allow black representatives to be elected regularly. 
In Europe, however, socialist and communist parties imposed electoral systems based on proportional representation precisely because they open the door to representatives of minorities (the communists and socialists themselves). 
The few American cities that introduced this system in the Progressive era, between 1910 and 1930, soon abandoned it - or were forced to - in order to stop the election of black representatives. 
Today the only US city that uses proportional representation is the leftist bastion of Cambridge Massachusetts. 
Proportional representation is widely viewed as one factor that promotes the implementation of redistributive policies by providing a political voice to minorities. 
Cross-country evidence shows that the size of public redistributive spending increases with the degree of proportionality in the electoral system. 
There is more. 
Many redistributive programs in the US are run by the 50 states. 
States that are more racially heterogeneous have smaller redistributive programs, even controlling for their level of income. 
Welfare is relatively plentiful in the overwhelmingly white states of the North and Northwest (Oregon and Minnesota, to cite two examples) and in some states in New England (such as Vermont). 
It is lacking in the racially mixed Southeast and Southwest. 
Continental Europe is becoming, and will become, more ethnically mixed as more newcomers from Eastern Europe and the developing world arrive. 
Xenophobic parties are on the rise across Europe; in some cases, they are in office. 
Think of Jörg Haider and the late Pym Fortuyn, or, to a lesser extent, Italy's Northern League. 
It will not be long before even Europe's more respectable conservative parties reach for rhetoric about "foreigners coming here to feast off of our taxes." 
Simply put, when middle-class Europeans begin to think that a good portion of the poor are recent immigrants, their ingrained belief in the virtue of the welfare state will begin to waver. 
Even Europe's leftist intelligentsia now associates crime and urban squalor with immigration. 
The step from here to lamenting the high taxes spent on welfare for immigrants is a but a short one. 
When this happens - and I say "when," not "if" - there are three possible political responses. 
One is to close borders to poor immigrants, eliminating any correlation between poverty and immigration. 
The second is to somehow restrict welfare benefits to "natives." The third is to reduce the size of welfare for all because political support for it is declining. 
The first strategy is short sighted and the second odious. 
I hope that the third one will win out, because it would mean relatively open borders, no discrimination, and less government intervention. 
Not to worry: the European welfare state will remain more generous than the stingy American one, but it may become more manageable and less intrusive. 
The fact that this will come about because of ethnic "animosity" is sad and depressing. 
The silver lining is that the European welfare state does indeed need trimming! 
The Rape of Burma 
SYDNEY – Burma, once the richest country in Southeast Asia, today is mired in deep poverty. 
Its economy ruined by nearly 50 years of economic mismanagement under military rule, the only international rankings that it tops are those for most corrupt nation, world’s worst health system, and lowest spending on education – “accolades” that are sadly indicative of its people’s suffering. 
And yet, over the last few years Burma has also emerged as a significant producer of energy in Southeast Asia. 
Thanks to large fields of recoverable natural gas located offshore, Burma now earns substantial foreign exchange revenues. 
At present, most of these revenues ($1-1.5 billion per year, depending on price fluctuations) come from Thailand. 
Gas from Burma, piped onshore from the Gulf of Martaban, generates around 20% of Bangkok’s electricity supply. 
If all goes well, new gas fields recently discovered in the Bay of Bengal will provide even more gas for China’s Yunnan Province. 
To get the gas into Yunnan, a much longer pipeline – running the length of Burma – must be built. 
The project will be as difficult as it will be controversial. 
But, with no environmental or labor standards to contend with, few doubt that the pipeline will proceed. 
So, given its newfound energy riches, one might expect Burma’s public finances to be rather flush, with surpluses aplenty to spend on health, education and much else that the country so desperately needs. 
Alas, almost none of Burma’s gas revenues actually feed into its budget, owing to a rather ingenious device employed by the Burmese junta. 
The device is simple. 
Like many countries ruled by authoritarian regimes, Burma has a dual exchange rate system. 
The official exchange rate pegs Burma’s currency, the kyat , at a rate of six to one against the US dollar. 
The informal or black market exchange rate determines the value of the kyat according to supply and demand in the marketplace. 
Trading kyat in the black market is formally illegal (and Burma’s regime loves rounding up foreign exchange dealers from time to time), but it is the only way that people unconnected to the regime can ever hope to come across foreign currency. 
According to the informal exchange rate, the kyat’s worth is currently about 1,000 to one against the dollar. 
Given this dual exchange rate system, hiding Burma’s gas earnings becomes easy. 
By recording earnings at the official exchange rate, they are worth nearly 200 times below what they should be. 
Thus, Burma’s gas earnings of around $1.2 billion for 2006-07 are rendered into a mere 7.2 billion kyat in the country’s public accounts – less than 1% of the regime’s official public spending. 
Recorded at the market exchange rate, however, these earnings translate into 1.2 trillion kyat – an amount large enough to eliminate Burma’s budget deficit, as well as the destructively inflationary money printing that is the regime’s preferred method of public finance. 
So where do Burma’s generals hide all the money they keep away from the state’s budget? 
No one but the generals knows for sure. 
An inspection of the vaults of the country’s Foreign Trade Bank might be a good place to start, however, as well as those of some accommodatingly unscrupulous banks offshore. 
Whatever the precise location of Burma’s riches, these hoards enable the junta to spend at its whim. 
A nuclear reactor, a new capital city, military pay increases – all of these and more have been on the menu of late. 
The one group that almost certainly will not benefit from any of the largesse are the Burmese people themselves, who are entitled to it and for whom it would mean an end to lives of poverty and want. 
The Rape of Freedom in Burma 
Gender-based sexual violence obstructs peace and development, particularly when it is a weapon used by military dictatorships against their own peoples. 
Burma is now permeated by such state-sponsored violence. 
Systematic sexual violence became visible in Burma when the Shan Women’s Action Network (SWAN) and the Shan Human Rights Foundation (SHRF) published Licence to Rape , which documents 625 cases of rape committed by the military in eastern Burma between 1996 and 2001. 
The report noted that nobody had been prosecuted. 
Burma is suffering the impact of decades of civil war. 
Civilians have become the main victims of a strategy aimed at undermining the guerrillas, which has resulted in forced labor, the use of human minesweepers, and massive relocations of entire villages. 
There are now an estimated 600,000 to one million internal refugees. 
SWAN and SHRF argue that rape is used as a weapon in the Burmese military’s war against ethnic minorities. 
Women and girls are particularly vulnerable ­– owing to gender as well as ethnicity – to a horrific practice whose aim is to demonstrate the army’s power and punish those who confront it. 
When the army enters a village, chaos erupts. 
Villagers are killed or ordered to pack their belongings and leave. 
Several of the reported rapes took place under such conditions, or when women are taken for forced labor. 
Many victims have fled Burma. 
SWAN and SHRF learned of many cases from women who arrived in Thailand. 
In February 2006, we visited a refugee camp on the Thai-Burma border and learned first hand of war and abuse. 
Licence to Rape has attracted wide attention in Southeast Asia. 
Kraisak Choonhavan, Chairman of the Thai Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee and Vice Chairperson of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus (AIPMC), called for an investigation by the United Nations. So did the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Commission. 
Rape brings stigma, shame, and reluctance on the part of victims to speak out about what happened to them. 
But an increasing number of women and girls from Burma have begun to tell of their experiences of rape and other forms of sexual violence in the country’s war-torn areas. 
Army deserters confirm that rapes have occurred. And the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women has published material that corroborates information in Licence to Rape and adds numerous new cases from Burma. 
Nevertheless, four years on, a UN investigation has yet to take place, because the military junta refuses to grant the UN access to the country. 
Incidents of rape continue to be reported, and the Burmese military surely must know what is happening. 
But the junta engages in Orwellian doublethink. 
It has rejected the reports, instead launching its own investigations whose conduct and staffing leave no room for confidence in their credibility. 
National governments and the international community have an obligation to protect women and children against abuse. 
In 2000, the UN Security Council recognized that gender-based violence thwarts security and adopted Resolution 1325, which calls on parties in conflict to respect the rights of women and children, and particularly to prevent gender-based violence. 
In 2004, the governments of ASEAN vowed to end the impunity states like Burma have enjoyed and signed the Declaration to Eliminate Violence Against Women in the ASEAN Region. 
Burma is failing miserably to live up to the standards of decency that the Southeast Asian region is setting for itself. 
It has ratified the UN Convention to Eliminate Discrimination Against Women and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
Moreover, a national committee exists for the advancement of women. 
But such measures are of no use when the military remains firmly in control, the rule of law is absent, and the government refuses to admit to the systematic sexual violence committed by its soldiers as they terrorize the population. 
ASEAN cannot afford to stand by idly. Neither can the international community. 
Such abuse of power is inadmissible, and we expect ASEAN to address the military’s use of rape in the conflict in Burma. 
We urge the UN Security Council to raise the issue. 
All of Burma’s people deserve security, and refugee women and girls who have experienced gender-based violence need the world’s solidarity and support. 
The Re-Birth of Japanese Democracy 
NEW YORK – Moods and fashions in Japan often arrive like tsunamis, typhoons, or landslides. 
After more than 50 years of almost uninterrupted power, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been buried in a general election. 
Once before, in 1993, change came when a coalition of opposition parties briefly took power, but the LDP still held on to a majority in the Diet’s powerful lower house. 
This time, even that last bastion has fallen. 
The center-left Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took more than 300 of 480 seats in the lower house. 
The LDP rules no more. 
The world, fixated on China’s rise, was slow to pay attention to this seismic shift in the politics of the globe’s second largest economy. 
Japanese politics has a dull image in the world’s press. 
Most editors, when they cover Japan at all, prefer stories about the zaniness of its popular youth culture, or the wilder shores of Japanese sex. 
The main reason for this is, of course, that Japanese politics was dull, at least since the mid-1950s, when the LDP consolidated its monopoly on power. 
Only real aficionados of arcane moves inside the ruling party could be bothered to follow the ups and downs of factional bosses, many of whom were from established political families, and most of whom relied on shady financing. 
Corruption scandals erupted from time to time, but these, too, were usually part of intra-party maneuvers to rein in politicians who got too big for their britches, or who tried to grab power before their time. 
The system worked in a fashion: LDP faction bosses took turns as prime minister, palms were greased by various business interests, more or less capable bureaucrats decided on domestic economic policies, and the United States took care of Japan’s security (and much of its foreign policy, too). 
Some thought this system would last forever. 
Indeed, it has often been said, by Japanese as well as foreign commentators, that a de facto one-party state suits the Japanese. 
Stability, based on soft authoritarianism, is the Asian way, now followed by China. 
Asians don’t like the messy contentiousness of parliamentary democracy. 
Look what happens when Asians are foolish enough to import such a system, as in South Korea or Taiwan. 
Instead of civilized debate, they have filibusters and fisticuffs. 
But, notwithstanding the occasional bust-ups, Korean and Taiwanese democracies seem remarkably robust. 
And the argument that Japanese, or other Asians, are culturally averse to political competition is not historically true. 
In fact, Japanese history is full of strife and rebellion, and Japan was the first independent Asian country with a multi-party system. 
Its early postwar democracy was so unruly, with mass demonstrations, militant trade unions, and vigorous left-wing parties, that a deliberate attempt was made to squeeze politics out of the system and impose the boredom of a one-party state. 
This happened in the mid-1950’s, not for cultural, but for entirely political reasons. 
Like Italy (perhaps the closest European parallel to Japan), Japan was a front-line state in the Cold War. Domestic conservatives, as well as the US government, worried about the possibility of a left-wing, even Communist takeover. 
So a large conservative coalition party (much like the Italian Christian Democrats), funded to some degree by the US, was put in place to marginalize all left-wing opposition. 
This involved some strong-arm tactics, especially against the unions, but it worked mostly because the middle class settled for an informal deal: increased material prosperity in exchange for political acquiescence. 
The “LDP state” was based on the promise, given by Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato in 1960, that family incomes would soon be doubled. 
Increasingly marginalized, the opposition dwindled into an impotent force, mere window-dressing to a one-party state. 
But one-party rule breeds complacency, corruption, and political sclerosis. 
In the last decade or so, the LDP – as well as the once-almighty bureaucracy that ran the system – began to look incompetent. 
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi gave the LDP a last breath of life by promising to reform it in 2001. 
Whatever he did was not enough. 
The patience of Japan’s middle-class, rocked by economic crisis, finally cracked. 
The victorious DPJ may not immediately set off any political fireworks. 
Its leader, Yukio Hatoyama, is an uncharismatic scion of yet another established dynasty – his grandfather, Hatoyama Ichiro, took over as prime minister in 1954 from Yoshida Shigeru, who was the grandfather of the last LDP Prime Minister Taro Aso. 
The DPJ’s aims are excellent: more authority to elected politicians, less bureaucratic meddling, more independence from the US, better relations with Asian neighbors, more power to voters and less to big business, and so on. 
But it would be wrong to belittle the importance of what has happened. 
Even if the DPJ fails to implement most of its reforms in short order, the fact that Japanese voters opted for change will invigorate their country’s democracy. 
Even if the system were to become something like Japan’s democracy in the 1920’s, with two more or less conservative parties competing for power, this would still be preferable to a one-party state. 
Any opposition is better than none. 
It keeps the government on its toes. 
A firm rejection of the one-party state will also reverberate far beyond Japan’s borders. 
It shows clearly that the desire for political choice is not confined to a few fortunate countries, mostly in the Western world. 
This is a vital lesson, especially at a time when China’s economic success is convincing too many leaders that citizens, especially but not only in Asia, want to be treated like children. 
The Re-Birth of Utopia 
Franz Müntefering’s resignation as chairman of Germany’s Social Democrats in the face of a challenge from his party’s leftwing has, like the divisive French referendum on the European Constitution this past May, exposed deep ideological cleavages – divisions not only about Europe, but about the very foundations of society and the economy. 
Behind the critiques directed at the EU and national governments as “not being social enough,” lurks an image of the Union as a trap that is forcing its members to bend to the fateful disciplines of the market, thus depriving national leaders of their ability to realize important social goals. 
This cleavage now seems set to shape not only Germany’s future coalition government, but the future of politics across Europe. 
In France, this division is evident not only on the extremes of right and left, and in traditionally nationalist Gaullist circles, but also among most socialist voters, who decided to spurn the party leadership’s pro-European stance. 
This fundamental debate is not about to abate. 
On the contrary, as the German election shows and with a presidential election looming in France, the debate has intensified. 
In France, this intensity is particularly visible within Socialist ranks. 
With preparations for the party’s November congress in full swing, a conflict that goes back to the party’s founding is reappearing. 
On one side is a social-democratic vision, which basically favors the market economy but seeks to alleviateits harsher effects; on the other side stands a radical vision that extols a revolutionary “break with capitalism.” 
With the disappearance of the communist world and the failure of its collectivist policies, one would think that this debate had been resolved in favor of the reformist vision. 
But the surprise of the last few months is that an important part of the Socialist electorate and party leaders back radical change. 
Moreover, a substantial portion of the broader anti-liberal left, composed of communists, ecologists, union activists, and adherents of the movement Attac accuse the reformists of subordinating themselves to liberal globalization and advocate, instead, a radical transformation of society and the economy. 
The media success of Olivier Besancenot, a 31-year-old representative of the most intransigent section of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist League, reflects the power of this dream. 
Having received over 4% of the vote during the first round of the presidential election of 2002, Besancenotis now, according to opinion polls, the 38th most popular person in France. 
Interestingly, an echo of the ideas mooted by radical anti-globalists can be found in someinitiatives coming from the right. 
President Jacques Chirac of France, but also Brazil’s leftist president, Lula da Silva support a tax on airline tickets designed to finance poor countries’ development. 
Similarly, the centrist leader François Bayrou, has proposed imposing a “Tobin tax” (named after its creator, the Nobel laureate economist James Tobin) on financial transactions, with the proceeds to be used to support socially worthy causes. 
How do we explain this resurgent radicalism, which seems to ignore European and international political realities? 
One might suspect the influence of French political traditions which, on the right as much as on the left, always prefer purity of principle to messy compromise. 
Add to this the congenital French mistrust of liberalism – indeed, French is one of the rare languages in which the word “liberalism” has a pejorative connotation – joined to an equally deep-rooted perception of the state (again, on both the right and the left) as the defender of the general interest par excellence. 
While pragmatism has come to dominate northern Europe’s socialist parties since the 1930’s – and, after the 1957 Congress of Bad Godesberg, the Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) as well – a preference for revolutionary ideology has always prevailed, at least on the rhetorical level, among French socialists. 
But this cannot be the whole explanation, because a similar radicalization is occurring within German’s left, where the alliance of the post-communist PDS – still powerful in the Länder of what was East Germany – and SPD dissidents led by Oskar Lafontaine promotes equally radical proposals. 
With the evident failure of both leftist and rightist governments to stem the rising wave of unemployment, a growing part of the French and German electorates no longer seems to believe in traditional solutions. 
The welfare state, largely associated with the reformist social-democratic movement, is now reaching its limits in the form of uncontrolled public deficits and unsupportable levels of taxation. 
Similarly, the social mobility once fostered by the welfare state has suffered serious reverses. 
Globalized markets are viewed as bringingmore inequalities, austerity, and insecurity than the promised benefits of economic growth. 
In this disenchanted environment, dreams of utopia thrive. 
But it is a fundamental characteristic of utopias that they cannot be implemented. 
What is now needed is a more modest debate about how to reconcile the deficiencies of the market with the demands of solidarity. 
Should the state confine itself to creating an economic environment favorable to private enterprise? 
How extensively should it contribute to security, education, research, innovation, and protection of the poor? 
But such debates can be fruitful only if they recognize the economic and political constraints under which modern states operate. 
Indeed, the role of the state is made more complicated by the fact that market regulation is becoming less national and more transnational. 
Instead of throwing up our hands in despair, we should adhere to a distinction dear to the great German sociologist Max Weber, for now is a time when the ethics of responsibility must prevail over the ethics of conviction. 
The Re-Education of Hong Kong 
HONG KONG – After less than 100 days in office, C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong’s new Chief Executive, is already in political intensive care. 
In record time, he has managed to lose his veneer of competence, credibility, and steely leadership. 
One of his cabinet appointees was arrested for corruption within two weeks of Leung’s assumption of his official duties. 
Another was found to have been a slumlord who owned illegal cage-like flats that he blamed entirely on his wife, denying any involvement whatsoever. 
Leung himself was caught with several illegal structures in his house, a violation that he exploited successfully against his rival, Henry Tang, in the election campaign. 
Leung has also distinguished himself by inciting a large swathe of school teachers and students to stage massive street protests against his hasty effort to insert a “national education” program into the school curriculum in order to “reconnect” Hong Kong’s young people with the motherland. 
For tens of thousands of student protesters, many with their parents in tow, the potential death of an honest education was too much to bear. 
The goal of the program, inherited from the previous administration, is a good one: expand knowledge among the young about modern China. 
But, as Tang correctly pointed out in response to a question about the protests, the “devil is in the details.” 
What triggered the uproar was the appearance of a “model” textbook, financed by the government and published by a pro-China think tank. 
The textbook contains mostly propaganda, including assertions that China’s one-party system is wonderful, whereas multiparty democracy as practiced in the United States has created harmful social turbulence. 
It offers no discussion of the lethal policies since 1949 that led to the persecution and starvation of tens of millions of Chinese. 
Nor does it mention the fratricidal political movements from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution. 
The program was clearly meant to indoctrinate, not educate. 
Massive protests forced Leung to withdraw a deadline to implement the new curriculum. 
He has also given the schools flexibility concerning when and perhaps how to introduce it. 
Since nearly all schools are dependent on government subsidies, the grant of flexibility is widely perceived to be a tactical delay. 
With the job security of schoolmasters at risk, most are sure to implement the program. 
The protesters, led by a 15-year-old student, now a folk hero, have retreated, but that, too, is a tactical decision. 
The students have promised to continue to fight the program until it is scrapped. 
But why does China’s government seek to impose the curriculum in the first place? 
After all, Hong Kong has one of the world’s most educated populations: the city has, in per capita terms, perhaps more graduates of the world’s top 20 universities than anywhere outside of Manhattan. 
Nevertheless, after more than 60 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to retain a deep sense of insecurity. 
The Internet may be ubiquitous in modern China, but YouTube and Facebook, so accepted as a part of normal life around the world, are still banned, and the Public Security Bureau has built a vast Internet monitoring system to filter and censor whatever China’s leaders believe they must fear. 
While dissent is the lifeblood of any open society, for China it is a dangerous poison. 
Moreover, China fears that Hong Kong, with a population of less than eight million, might present a systemic problem as an alternative form of government, even though many Communists and their allies hold key positions in Hong Kong’s private and public sectors. 
Instead of accepting that “love” cannot be enforced and must be won, Hong Kong’s over-zealous “patriots” cannot wait to show their loyalty by trying to mandate primitive propaganda. 
Few in Hong Kong are buying the political elite’s mantra that the national education program is the “right” thing to do. 
They know that practically all of the ruling elite’s children attend expensive schools in the United States and the United Kingdom, where they would be shielded from the mindless drivel at home. 
Leung’s son, for example, is reportedly a student at Winchester College, one of the UK’s most exclusive boarding schools. 
And most, if not all, of the children of the ruling elite in Beijing are in a similar position. 
The daughter of Xi Jinping, the presumptive future leader who has now reemerged from an unexplained absence, is attending Harvard under an assumed name. 
Disgraced ex-Politburo member Bo Xilai’s hard-partying son, Bo Guagua, attended Harrow, Winston Churchill’s alma mater, then Oxford and Harvard. 
Their parents clearly know that “national education” is not needed for a good education. 
Unfortunately, Hong Kong’s younger generation is losing confidence in democracy. 
Popular elections do not translate into representation in a system designed by China to ensure that its allies win a majority every time. 
As a result, more and more young people are turning to street demonstrations to make their voices heard. 
And, while no one in Hong Kong wants independence from China, continued strong-arm tactics to force Hong Kong to “love” China could begin to inspire such sentiments. 
Leung’s tone-deafness to popular feeling revives one of the main issues that he managed to dodge during the election campaign. 
At the time, he denied vehemently that he was a member of the CCP. 
He claimed that he had only Hong Kong’s interest in mind within the limits of China’s “one country, two systems” formula. 
So far, however, he seems inclined to make one of those systems resemble the other. 
But China’s national interest is to ensure that Hong Kong remains a first-rate city, modern and open. 
Pulling Hong Kong down, in the name of patriotism, can only impede the advance to modernity that all of China needs to become truly great. 
The Real Abortion Tragedy 
MELBOURNE – In the Dominican Republic last month, a pregnant teenager suffering from leukemia had her chemotherapy delayed, because doctors feared that the treatment could terminate her pregnancy and therefore violate the nation’s strict anti-abortion law. 
After consultations between doctors, lawyers, and the girl’s family, chemotherapy eventually was begun, but not before attention had again been focused on the rigidity of many developing countries’ abortion laws. 
Abortion receives extensive media coverage in developed countries, especially in the United States, where Republicans have used opposition to it to rally voters. 
Recently, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign counter-attacked, releasing a television advertisement in which a woman says that it is “a scary time to be a woman,” because Mitt Romney has said that he supports outlawing abortion. 
But much less attention is given to the 86% of all abortions that occur in the developing world. 
Although a majority of countries in Africa and Latin America have laws prohibiting abortion in most circumstances, official bans do not prevent high abortion rates. 
In Africa, there are 29 abortions per 1,000 women, and 32 per 1,000 in Latin America. 
The comparable figure for Western Europe, where abortion is generally permitted in most circumstances, is 12. 
According to a recent report by the World Health Organization, unsafe abortions lead to the death of 47,000 women every year, with almost all of these deaths occurring in developing countries. 
A further five million women are injured each year, sometimes permanently. 
Almost all of these deaths and injuries could be prevented, the WHO says, by meeting the need for sex education and information about family planning and contraception, and by providing safe, legal induced abortion, as well as follow-up care to prevent or treat medical complications. 
An estimated 220 million women in the developing world say that they want to prevent pregnancy, but lack either knowledge of, or access to, effective contraception. 
That is a huge tragedy for individuals and for the future of our already very heavily populated planet. 
Last month, the London Summit on Family Planning, hosted by the British government’s Department for International Development and the Gates Foundation, announced commitments to reach 120 million of these women by 2020. 
The Vatican newspaper responded by criticizing Melinda Gates, whose efforts in organizing and partly funding this initiative will, it is estimated, lead to nearly three million fewer babies dying in their first year of life, and to 50 million fewer abortions. 
One would have thought that Roman Catholics would see these outcomes as desirable. 
(Gates is herself a practicing Catholic who has seen what happens when women cannot feed their children, or are maimed by unsafe abortions.) 
Restricting access to legal abortion leads many poor women to seek abortion from unsafe providers. 
The legalization of abortion on request in South Africa in 1998 saw abortion-related deaths drop by 91%. 
And the development of the drugs misoprostol and mifepristone, which can be provided by pharmacists, makes relatively safe and inexpensive abortion possible in developing countries. 
Opponents will respond that abortion is, by its very nature, unsafe – for the fetus. 
They point out that abortion kills a unique, living human individual. 
That claim is difficult to deny, at least if by “human” we mean “member of the species Homo sapiens.” 
It is also true that we cannot simply invoke a woman’s “right to choose” in order to avoid the ethical issue of the moral status of the fetus. 
If the fetus really did have the moral status of any other human being, it would be difficult to argue that a pregnant woman’s right to choose includes the right to bring about the death of the fetus, except perhaps when the woman’s life is at stake. 
The fallacy in the anti-abortion argument lies in the shift from the scientifically accurate claim that the fetus is a living individual of the species Homo sapiens to the ethical claim that the fetus therefore has the same right to life as any other human being. 
Membership of the species Homo sapiens is not enough to confer a right to life on a being. 
Nor can something like self-awareness or rationality warrant greater protection for the fetus than for, say, a cow, because the fetus has mental capacities that are inferior to those of cows. 
Yet “pro-life” groups that picket abortion clinics are rarely seen picketing slaughterhouses. 
We can plausibly argue that we ought not to kill, against their will, self-aware beings who want to continue to live. 
We can see this as a violation of their autonomy, or a thwarting of their preferences. 
But why should a being’s potential to become rationally self-aware make it wrong to end its life before it actually has the capacity for rationality or self-awareness? 
We have no obligation to allow every being with the potential to become a rational being to realize that potential. 
If it comes to a clash between the supposed interests of potentially rational but not yet even conscious beings and the vital interests of actually rational women, we should give preference to the women every time. 
The Real Blockade in Cuba 
Raúl Rivero Castañeda, a leading Cuban poet and dissident, was sentenced to 20 years in prison this week for organizing a petition that called for free elections. 
Written some months before his arrests, this article details Rivero Castañeda's objections to the Castro regime. 
HAVANA: A man riding the Chinese-made Forever brand bicycle under the Caribbean sun after eating a single slice of bread, washed down with very bad coffee, finds it difficult to ponder America's trade embargo against Cuba. 
Such a man has lunch on his mind-his and his family's. 
For him, abstract thought is a luxury that requires time, information, and a reason to reflect on a subject that, at first sight, appears to be from another galaxy. 
The truth is that ordinary Cubans are more oppressed by a personal embargo, one that has transformed them into blindfolded and muzzled pawns. 
The debate over the American embargo pales in comparison - removed to a far corner of the mind - to the obstructive domestic situation that envelops them. 
In this country, the real blockade, the one that affects the daily life of the people, is the internal governing system. 
It is the noose that ensures that Cuba remains immobilized and poor. 
The old standoff between the two nations is beside the point to ordinary people; they desire a closer relationship with the US, where many of their families and friends live. 
However, no political process has created a smooth path toward such an ending. 
Thus, the stalemate between the two nations really concerns only Cubans who have time to contemplate lofty political questions. 
These individuals read newspapers fabricated in the offices of the Communist Party; view only two television channels, both cut from the same cloth; and listen to radios that play the same worn-out speeches. 
Cuba provides no free flow of information and its citizens receive and read only pure propaganda. 
While the public is suspicious of government proclamations, it has no means to be heard. 
Hence, its silence appears to sanction the situation. 
In reality, Cubans want to remove the inequalities that exist between the people and their leaders before they deal with the problems between their country and the US. 
Ordinary citizens want to own a modest business, have access to a free press, organize political parties, re-make society, and liberate prisoners. 
The authorities like to paint themselves as the victims of a powerful giant set on smothering a nation and its united people, but such a victim's face cannot be found when you look closely. 
The nation is not a united citizenry, but rather a mediocre country created through the universal gagging of its people. 
One can systematically catalog the ways that the authorities mistreat many of its people as terribly as they claim that Cuba's enemies treat her. 
These officials should take the money spent trying to convince other nations about the generous nature of Cuba's public health and education systems and apply it to the needs of Cuba's people. 
In fact, medical services are becoming more and more precarious and the educational system has not advanced beyond a common system of political indoctrination. 
Indeed, parents cannot really influence how schools shape their children. 
Whenever the government does address basic public welfare issues, its efforts merely produce dependent individuals who submit to the will of a self-selected group of leaders who are "elected" from time-to-time by fake elections. 
The leaders' commitment to the sovereignty of the masses thus rings false. 
Talk about the Cubans' free will is in reality a capricious and criminal act against the people. 
In recent weeks, thirty-six human rights activists, members of the alternative press, and representatives of the emerging civil rights movement have been imprisoned and may be tried. 
We can all agree that human beings are not duty-bound to live according to one master or philosophy; that individuals must live freely, enjoying the right to a bountiful and joyful existence among family and friends. 
But in Cuba one lives in the midst of a propaganda machine that infiltrates life on a daily basis; that emphasizes a climate of popular cheerfulness; that portrays the joy of a neutered horse, with its ability to befuddle the innocent, inspire the ignorant, and comfort the frustrated. 
Cubans are in the end consigned to hold fast to rigid and impossible schemes. 
As a result, hundreds of thousands of young adults are embarked on a future whose path is strewn with risky symbols and immense challenges. 
Sensing that the door has been slammed shut against their country's future, they work diligently merely for their individual good. 
The Real Che Guevara 
PARIS – Hollywood history is often nonsensical, but filmmakers usually have the good sense not to whitewash killers and sadists. 
Steven Soderbergh’s new film about Che Guevara, however, does that, and more. 
Che the revolutionary romantic, as depicted by Benecio del Toro in Soderbergh’s film, never existed. 
That hero of the left, with his hippie hair and beard, an image now iconic on t-shirts and coffee mugs around the world, is a myth concocted by Fidel Castro’s propagandists – something of a cross between Don Quixote and Robin Hood. 
Like those tall tales, Fidel’s myth of Che bears a superficial resemblance to historical facts, but the real story is far darker. 
Some Robin Hood probably did brutalize the rich and, to cover his tracks, gave some of his loot to the poor. 
In medieval Spain, Quixote-like knights probably did roam the countryside, ridding it not of dragons but of the land’s few remaining Muslims. 
The same goes for the legendary Che. 
No teenager in rebellion against the world or his parents seems able to resist Che’s alluring image. 
Just wearing a Che t-shirt is the shortest and cheapest way to appear to be on the right side of History. 
What works for teenagers also seems to work with forever-young movie directors. 
In the 1960’s, the Che look, with beard and beret, was at least a glib political statement. 
Today, it is little more than a fashion accoutrement that inspires a big-budget Hollywood epic. 
Are Che theme parks next? 
But once there was a real Che Guevara: he is less well known than the fictional puppet that has replaced reality. 
The true Che was a more significant figure than his fictional clone, for he was the incarnation of what revolution and Marxism really meant in the twentieth century. 
Che was no humanist. 
No communist leader, indeed, ever held humanist values. 
Karl Marx certainly was not one. 
True to their movement’s founding prophet, Stalin, Mao, Castro, and Che held no respect for life. 
Blood needed to be shed if a better world was to be baptized. 
When criticized by one of his early companions for the death of millions during the Chinese revolution, Mao observed that countless Chinese die everyday, so what did it matter? 
Likewise, Che could kill with a shrug. 
Trained as a medical doctor in Argentina, he chose not to save lives but to suppress them. 
After he seized power, Che put to death five hundred “enemies” of the revolution without trial, or even much discrimination. 
Castro, no humanist himself, did his best to neutralize Guevara by appointing him Minister for Industry. 
As could be expected, Che applied Soviet policies to the Cubans: agriculture was destroyed and ghost factories dotted the landscape. 
He did not care about Cuba’s economy or its people: his purpose was to pursue revolution for its own sake, whatever it meant, like art for art’s sake. 
Indeed, without his ideology, Che would have been nothing more than another serial killer. 
Ideological sloganeering allowed him to kill in larger numbers than any serial killer could imagine, and all in the name of justice. 
Five centuries ago, Che probably would have been one of those priest/soldiers exterminating Latin America’s natives in the name of God. 
In the name of History, Che, too, saw murder as a necessary tool of a noble cause. 
But suppose we judge this Marxist hero by his own criteria: did he actually transform the world? 
The answer is yes – but for the worse. 
The communist Cuba he helped to forge is an undisputed and unmitigated failure, much more impoverished and much less free than it was before its “liberation.” 
Despite the social reforms the left likes to trumpet about Cuba, its literacy rate was higher before Castro came to power, and racism against the black population was less pervasive. 
Indeed, Cuba’s leaders today are far more likely to be white than they were in Batista’s day. 
Beyond Cuba, the Che myth has inspired thousands of students and activists across Latin America to lose their lives in foolhardy guerrilla struggles. 
The left, inspired by the siren call of Che, chose armed struggle instead of elections. 
By doing so, it opened the way to military dictatorship. 
Latin America is not yet cured of these unintended consequences of Guevarism. 
Indeed, fifty years after Cuba’s revolution, Latin America remains divided. 
Those nations that rejected Che’s mythology and chose the path of democracy and the free market, such as Brazil, Peru, and Chile, are better off than they ever were: equality, freedom, and economic progress have advanced in unity. 
By contrast, those nations that remain nostalgic for the cause of Che, such as Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia, are at this very moment poised on the brink of civil war. 
The real Che, who spent most of his time as Castro’s central banker supervising executions, deserves to be better known. 
Perhaps if Soderbergh’s two-part Che epic succeeds at the box office, his financial backers will want to film a more truthful sequel. 
The Real Danger of Global Warming 
PRAGUE – I am surprised at how so many people nowadays in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere have come to support policies underpinned by hysteria over global warming, particularly cap-and-trade legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and subsidies for “green” energy sources. 
I am convinced that this is a misguided strategy – not only because of the uncertainty about the dangers that global warming might pose, but also because of the certainty of the damage that these proposed policies aimed at mitigation will impose. 
I was invited to address this issue at a recent conference in Santa Barbara, California. 
My audience included business leaders who hope to profit from cap-and-trade policies and from subsidies for renewable energy and “green” jobs. 
My advice to them was to not get caught up in the hysteria. 
Europe is several years ahead of the US in implementing policies intended to mitigate global warming. 
All of the European Union’s member countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and adopted a wide range of policies to lower their emissions and meet their Kyoto targets. 
These policies include a cap-and-trade initiative known as the Emissions Trading Scheme, steep fuel taxes, and ambitious programs to build windmills and other renewable energy projects. 
These policies were undertaken at a time when the EU economy was doing well and – one hopes – with full knowledge that they would have significant costs. 
With the global financial crisis and the sudden economic downturn, two things are becoming clear. 
First, it will be difficult to afford these expensive new sources of energy. 
Second, energy rationing policies like cap-and-trade will be a permanent drag on economic activity. 
Ironically, emissions have not decreased as a result of these policies, but are doing so now as the world economy moves into recession. 
This is not a surprise to someone like me, having been actively involved in my country’s transition from communism to a free society and market economy. 
The old, outmoded heavy industries that were the pride of our Communist regime were shut down – practically overnight – because they could not survive the opening of the economy. 
The result was a dramatic decline in CO2 emissions. 
The secret behind the cut in emissions was economic decline. 
As the economies of the Czech Republic and other central and eastern European countries were rebuilt and began to grow again, emissions have naturally started to increase. 
It should be clear to everyone that there is a very strong correlation between economic growth and energy use. 
So I am amazed to see people going along with the currently fashionable political argument that policies like cap-and-trade, government mandates, and subsidies for renewable energy can actually benefit an economy. 
It is claimed that government, working together with business, will create “a new energy economy,” that the businesses involved will profit, and that everyone will be better off. 
This is a fantasy. 
Cap-and-trade can only work by raising energy prices. 
Consumers who are forced to pay higher prices for energy will have less money to spend on other things. 
While the individual companies that provide the higher-priced “green” energy may do well, the net economic effect will be negative. 
It is necessary to look at the bigger picture. 
Profits can be made when energy is rationed or subsidized, but only within an economy operating at lower, or even negative, growth rates. 
This means that over the longer term, everyone will be competing for a piece of a pie that is smaller than it would have been without energy rationing. 
This does not auger well either for growth or for working our way out of today’s crisis. 
The Real Hazard of Globalization 
It is fashionable to blame the International Monetary Fund for the wave of financial turmoil that has swept emerging markets since Mexico's ``Tequila crisis'' of 1994. 
By bailing out countries in trouble time and again, the IMF allegedly encouraged investors to take unwarranted risks, plowing money into countries without properly assessing whether they could ever pay it back. 
According to IMF critics, bailouts allowed leaders from Brazil to Turkey to avoid painful but necessary reforms, with the perverse effect of making crises inevitable. 
This argument - an example of what economists call ``moral hazard'' - is easy on the mind, but it has feet of clay. 
In fact, foreign investment in emerging markets already started to subside after 1995, then plummeted with the Asian crisis of 1997, and has remained low ever since - even as the IMF orchestrated many of the bailouts that allegedly distorted investor behavior in the first place! 
Moreover, foreign investment in emerging markets shifted after 1994 to factories, real estate, service industries, and so forth. 
Unlike foreign bondholders, who could cut and run after the IMF guaranteed that they would be paid, these direct investors suffered major losses when crisis struck--and thus can hardly be said to have benefited from bailouts. 
Ever since the beginning of the 1990s, when private credit to emerging markets soared to roughly ten times its annual average in 1970-89, the main source of financial contagion has not been moral hazard, but what might best be called globalization hazard. 
The hazard struck after 1996, when foreign private investors fled emerging markets even faster than they had flooded them. 
For example, in 1997-98 Thailand suffered an outflow of foreign capital equivalent to 26% of GDP, despite a solid record of sustained economic growth. 
Why were even relatively well-run economies pulled under so suddenly? 
The most likely scenario is that investors attributed the steep initial rise in credit flows after 1989 to sound policies in emerging markets. 
Throughout much of the 1990s, the ``Washington establishment'' reinforced this belief, encouraging an overly optimistic belief in the permanence of large credit flows. 
Ultimately, however, each crisis multiplied the worries of investors about emerging-market risk. 
Worse still, their mood reversal was swift owing to the lack of a long and reliable track record for emerging-market debt. 
This drove up interest rates for emerging-market debt as an asset class . 
As borrowing costs rose in all emerging markets - regardless of their fundamental economic health - so did the probability of recurrent crises, forming a vicious circle. 
If this were the whole story, then what lay at the root of financial contagion in emerging markets would be of secondary importance. 
Whether moral hazard or globalization hazard, more careful credit rationing by investors could be expected to reduce the recurrence of financial crises. 
But only up to a point. 
For while the moral hazard argument emphasizes the orthodox commandment ``Thou shall not intervene,'' the crucial feature of globalization hazard is market failure . 
Unlike moral hazard, market failure highlights circumstances in which government intervention is both socially desirable and economically defensible. 
That the failure of international capital markets led to sudden and devastating capital outflows after 1996 is only one such episode. 
Consider other devastating events that are uninsured (and often uninsurable) in the private sector. 
In the US, for example, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes trigger immediate Federal assistance. 
Similarly, the cost of the public's aversion to air travel following the September 11 th terrorist attacks would have been much higher for the economy as a whole if the airline industry had been allowed to collapse. 
Unfortunately, many emerging markets have weak governments that cannot define credible policies for financing intervention in such circumstances. 
A typical case is a country whose terms of trade abruptly deteriorate - for example, Nicaragua after the recent collapse of coffee prices caused by Vietnam's bumper crop. 
When this happens in a country with few other economic sectors that can compete internationally and so take up the slack, the result is similar to a natural disaster. 
The government, faced with lower budget revenues, is likely to issue new debt, but without being able to specify how it will be repaid. 
So, who will pay the bill eventually? 
The moment official intervention is required, everyone runs for cover. 
Investment decisions are postponed, implying slower growth and an even more precarious fiscal position. 
In an open economy, fears of higher taxes may spur capital flight and a run against the domestic banks, requiring even bigger government transfers. 
Weak governments grow weaker by the day. 
But even weak governments are not entirely helpless. 
They can lengthen their debt maturities by imposing controls on capital inflows, as Chile and Colombia have done. 
They also can conclude trade agreements with more advanced economies. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, probably contributed to Mexico's strong and lasting recovery from the Tequila crisis. 
The Tequila crisis demonstrates that rapid multilateral action - in this case, a $50 billion package to refinance short-term debts at below-market rates - can also be effective in preventing the spread of contagion. 
Such packages provide the breathing space that governments need in a crisis in order to launch longer-term reforms. 
This was true of Thailand and South Korea, when both moved fast to strengthen their banking sectors after receiving IMF bailouts. 
IMF assistance is, of course, no universal panacea. 
Emerging markets are inherently fragile markets. 
Precisely for this reason, the problem has been too little multilateral intervention, not too much. 
The Real Long March 
Every nation has its founding myth. 
For Communist China, it is the Long March – a story on a par with Moses leading the Israelites’ exodus out of Egypt. 
I was raised on it. 
The myth can be stated succinctly. 
The fledgling Communist Party and its three Red Armies were driven out of their bases in the South in the early 1930’s by Chiang Kaishek’s Nationalist government. 
Pursued and harried by their enemies, they crossed high mountains, turbulent rivers, and impassable grassland, with Mao steering the course from victory to victory. 
After two years and 10,000 miles of endurance, courage, and hope against impossible odds, the Red Armies reached northwest China. 
Only a fifth of the 200,000 soldiers remained, worn out, battered, but defiant. 
A decade later, they fought back, defeated Chiang Kaishek, and launched Mao’s New China. 
How does China’s founding myth stand up to reality? 
In 2004, seventy years after it began, I set out to retrace the Long March. 
It remains a daunting journey, through areas little changed to this day, inaccessible, and desperately poor. 
Of the 40,000 survivors, perhaps 500 are still alive; 
I tracked down and interviewed 40 of them – ordinary people who were left behind or managed to reach the end, but with stories that are highly instructive. 
Huang Zhiji was a boy, little taller than his rifle, when he joined the Red Army. 
He had no choice: they had arrested his father and would not release him until Huang agreed. 
He thought of deserting, but stayed for fear of being caught and shot. 
Many did run away. 
Six weeks into the March, Mao’s First Army was reduced from 86,000 to 30,000 troops. 
The loss is still blamed on the Xiang River Battle, the Army’s first big engagement of the March. 
But at most 15,000 died in battle; the rest vanished. 
Another battle, over the Dadu River, is the core of the Long March legend: 22 brave men supposedly overpowered a regiment of Nationalist troops guarding the chains of the Luding Bridge with machine guns, and opened the way for the Marchers. 
Mao told Edgar Snow, author of Red Star Over China, that crossing the Dadu River was the single most important incident during the Long March, and today it is eulogized as such. 
But documents that I have seen indicate that the general who commanded the division that crossed the Dadu River first told Party historians a very different story. “This affair was not as complicated as people made it out to be later,” he said. 
“When you investigate historical facts, you should respect the truth. How you present it is a different matter.” 
So the legend lives on. 
There was only a skirmish over the Dadu River. 
The local warlord, who hated Chiang Kaishek, let Mao pass. 
As a reward, he was later made a minister in the Communist government. 
The Marchers did not know where they would end up. 
There were constant debates about the final destination. 
When they converged in north China in October 1936, it was hailed as the end of the March. 
But the “promised land” was not as promised. 
It could barely support its own population, let alone the Red Armies. 
Soldiers had no clothes to protect them from freezing cold. 
Women were ordered to turn back and go home because there was not enough food. 
Barely a month after the union of the three Red Armies, the Party decided that the Long March was to continue. 
But the kidnapping of Chiang Kaishek by the general he had appointed to wipe out the Communists saved them. 
As part of the price for his release, Chiang recognized the Communists as legitimate. 
The Long March was over. 
Not, however, for the 21,000 men and women of the Western Legion. 
They belonged to the Fourth Army, headed by Zhang Guotao, Mao’s archrival. Their mission was to get help from Russia at the border in western China. 
But Mao kept sending them contradictory orders; the result was that they could neither fight nor retreat. 
Trapped in barren land where survival was difficult, the overwhelming forces of Muslim warlords wiped them out. 
Only 400 reached the border; the rest were killed or captured. 
It was the Red Army’s biggest defeat. 
Yet it is missing from official history. 
Wang Quanyan, a senior officer, was taken by a Muslim commander as a concubine. 
That was enough to make her a traitor in the eyes of the Party, negating all her years of dedication. 
She and the rest of the Fourth Army survivors had to fight for half a century to be recognized as Marchers. 
The Long Marchers persevered, fought, starved, despaired, and endured. 
Hunger drove the armies to take hostages for ransom. 
Purges continued until practically no officers were left to command battles. 
If the Marchers had doubts, they conquered them with the help of Communist propaganda. 
They rose to their ordealwith a bravery and self-sacrifice unsurpassed in China’s or anyone’s history. 
I asked a top general what he knew of communism at the time. “I had no idea then and now,” he replied. 
“I doubt that even Mao knew what it was.” For him, a survivor of extreme poverty and oppression, communism was a beautiful, sustaining dream, the hope of a just and advanced society. 
Perhaps no one knew or could know how much suffering would lie ahead, how vast the sacrifice would be, and how great the difference would be between the dream and the reality. 
The Real Risks of Deficits 
Deficits are back--with a vengeance. 
America's government budget deficit now stands at $455 billion, 4.1% of GDP. 
Two years ago, the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. 
Although marginally less bloated than the US deficit, other rich countries are drowning in red ink. 
The European Commission predicts that the French government deficit will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, with Germany's widening to 3.4%--both figures well beyond the deficit cap (3% of GDP) set by the Euro-zone's Stability and Growth Pact. 
By running a deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations. 
Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations. 
Their priority is paying for immediate problems, and for today's promised benefits. 
The accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding something of the future cost. 
But what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not. 
Deficits raise not only immediate political issues, but also issues of distributive justice between generations, and of intergenerational risk sharing. 
No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation. 
Whether or not deficits treat future generations properly depends on how a government's systems for taxation and expenditure are designed. 
Those who advocate running deficits often portray them as necessary to fix an economy in which confidence is draining away. 
Following Keynes, they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression can take hold. 
It is like putting a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal. 
But such arguments, although valid at times, have their limits. 
Japan's public deficits spawned a national debt of 140% of annual GDP, without producing any economic resurgence. 
Indeed, today's budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what Keynesian theory envisions. 
So discussions about deficits should be recast in terms of the really long-term intergenerational issues that matter. 
The issues are subtle, because they hinge on what future governments may do. 
In the past, some governments, when faced with large national debts, effectively ``inflated them away.'' 
They thus shifted the debt burden away from the next generation and onto investors who did not bail out of the bond market at the first sign of rising prices, or who postponed buying a house when inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage debt. 
Governments could decide to act this way again, especially if national debts grow bigger. 
A resurgence of substantial inflation may seem unthinkable in today's environment, but remember that even a relatively modest 6% annual inflation rate cuts the real value of a nation's debt in half in just 11 years. 
Continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed. 
Some future politicians may succeed again in planting the idea that inflation, being stimulative, is good for the economy. 
But in addition to today's officially measured government deficits, there are also other looming obligations caused by a demographic change (declining birth rates) and the prospect of huge social-welfare payments in the future. 
The scale of these obligations is monumental. 
In their 2003 report, the Trustees of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the Social Security System's solvency for the next 75 years will require an amount whose present value is $3.5 trillion, nearly equal to today's total US government debt ($3.9 trillion). 
The Trustees of the US Medicare Trust Funds (providing medical services to the retired) estimate that their unfunded obligations have a present value of $5.9 trillion--50% larger than America's official publicly-held national debt. 
The potential for budgetary shortfall with social security and health care is even worse in Europe and Japan, due to their more troublesome demographics. 
Moreover, unlike official national debt, social-welfare obligations are not fixed in currency. 
Instead, they are promises of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation. 
No government can thus ``inflate them away.'' 
But this does not mean that pensions and other welfare obligations are entirely fixed. 
What it does mean is that the problem is political. 
Pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy, and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue. 
Still, we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today's economic dilemmas. 
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a ``generational accounting'' that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations. 
What this means is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations, rather than make fixed promises--which most likely cannot be kept, anyway--of a certain payout in the future. 
For example, when demographic trends or persistent economic hardships impose undue social-welfare burdens on working people, benefits to pensioners should be automatically modified by raising the retirement age and/or adjusting benefits. 
Such adjustments will probably happen anyway in the coming decades, but only after a long lag and with many inequities in the process. 
What we need is the right system from the beginning, so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations. 
Can these issues be addressed now, when the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on short-term fixes? 
Hard times, like the Great Depression, have been occasions for fundamental changes. 
With proper leadership (which unfortunately seems in short supply), today's milder hardships could provide an opportunity for public discussion of better ways of intergenerational risk sharing. 
The Real Route to Democracy at the IMF 
Emerging market countries from Chile to China have been arguing for some time that the International Monetary Fund – the nerve center of the international financial system ­– needs to become more “democratic.” 
They want more policy influence the next time the Fund decides to bail out a fellow emerging-market country like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey. 
(Unfortunately, benign as current market conditions may seem, there will surely be a next time for some countries.) 
In the meantime, as a new “Washington Consensus” of best-practice economic policies inevitably emerges, developing countries want to feel that they helped design it, for better or worse. 
I couldn’t agree more. 
The IMF’s perceived “democratic deficit” is a serious challenge to the Fund’s political legitimacy and to its ability to effectively stabilize crisis situations. 
But let’s recognize that real democracy is only going to come when middle-income developing countries are prepared to back up their lofty rhetoric with hard cash. 
Right now is precisely the time to do so, given that the United States has become, without rival, the world’s most reckless borrower. 
The US is draining a whopping 75% of the world’s surplus savings. 
Today, even formerly bankrupt governments from Korea to Russia to Mexico are awash in dollars. 
Why not put some of those dollars to good use? 
These countries need to understand that calls to cut rich-country voting shares at the IMF, unless they are backed up by real money, are naïve, if not downright hypocritical. 
At the end of the day, as long as the IMF is in the lending business, it needs to keep its creditors happy. 
Otherwise, they will pull up stakes, and the Fund (and its sister organization, the World Bank) will have a debt crisis of its own. 
Right now, the US, Europe, and Japan put up the lion’s share of the capital, so they have disproportionate power. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. 
Many middle-income countries’ central banks are hoarding dollars today in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating too much against the sinking dollar. 
China alone, with over $600 billion in reserves, holds more than enough dollars to recapitalize the IMF four times over. 
Even Latin American governments now hold enough dollar reserve assets to buy out Europe’s shares in the Fund. 
It may seem strange to make middle-income countries pay for their own bailout insurance, but it isn’t. They have much more at stake in IMF policies than do rich countries. 
Many people have forgotten that the Fund was originally conceived as a cooperative – it bailed out England only a few decades ago, and almost had to bail out France. 
People forget these episodes because the Fund’s resources have not kept pace with the explosion of global capital markets so that today, the IMF lacks the capacity to bail out an Italy or a Japan (though the issue may well arise one day.) 
So, if the Fund is to resume its identity as a cooperative, it makes sense to shift its center of gravity. 
Would middle-income developing countries actually change things if they were big creditors at the Fund? 
I wonder. 
Admittedly, no developing country ever seems to vote against a big bailout for one of its brethren, no matter how ill conceived. 
But would such indiscriminate largesse persist if middle-income countries knew that their votes really counted, and that they were spending their own money? 
I doubt it. 
On the whole, I expect that the bailout policies of a more “democratic” IMF would look much as they do now. 
After all, the laws of economics are always going to force prodigal debtor countries into adopting austerity measures. 
If a country that has been borrowing like a drunk suddenly sees its credit dry up, it will tighten its belt – raise taxes, cut spending, or do both – with or without an international lender of last resort. 
Perhaps the IMF’s bedside manners would improve, perhaps not. 
In any case, greater political legitimacy would likely make the Fund’s crisis leadership smoother and more credible, potentially shortening crises and minimizing their pain. 
The big question is whether the rich countries that have long ruled the roost at the Fund would actually surrender some of their power. 
They might, and they should, even if global financial markets take time to adjust to a slightly smaller role for the dollar. 
They really have little to lose and much to gain. 
So there is an upside to today’s massive US fiscal and current account deficits. 
The structure of global imbalances, with the US the big borrower and emerging markets the creditors, presents a rare opportunity to finance a change in governance at the IMF. 
Let’s do it now before the chance slips away when the next round of crises hits. 
Fulfilling the Genomic Promise 
VIENNA – For most people, a promise is a reason to expect something, a well-founded hope without hype. 
And it is a promise in this sense that connects science to society: the public trusts that scientific and technological advancement are the keys to navigating the uncertain road to a better world, in which future generations can live longer, healthier, and happier lives. 
This promise originated almost 400 years ago, with the institutionalization of modern science. 
After discovering that mathematics could be applied to understanding the physical world, a small group of natural philosophers turned toward experimental empiricism with practical objectives. 
Spearheaded by this minority, the scientific revolution swept through Europe and, later, spread to the rest of the world. 
In his Instauratio Magna, Francis Bacon, one of modern science’s most articulate proponents, conveyed a vision of a new world, transformed through the systematic inquiry of natural phenomena. 
By imitating and twisting nature, he declared, its secrets would be revealed – and could be manipulated to improve humans’ lives. 
Bacon’s pragmatic objective of using a scientific understanding of natural causes to “effect all things possible” – what is now called innovation – was science’s original promise to society, and formed the core of the Age of Enlightenment. 
While many of science’s promises have been fulfilled – notably, the dramatic extension of the human lifespan and of leisure time – many others have been only partly achieved, or not at all. 
And yet society’s trust in science has not wavered. 
While specific objectives have changed, the overarching belief that scientific knowledge transforms people’s lives – as cultural, educational, and institutional factors converge with technological and industrial dynamics – has remained strong. 
Today, genetics is the leading source of scientific promise. 
Since James D. Watson and Francis Crick uncovered DNA’s structure in 1953, a massive amount of available genetic data has been identified, and novel forms of scientific organization and modes of working have emerged. 
As a result, genetics has brought science to the brink of a new era of enlightenment, in which individuals are understood in terms of the relationships among their unique genomic data. 
This movement – the latest incarnation of the endless quest for human advancement – poses new challenges to the relationship between science and society. 
As the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition: “The genomic revolution is here – are you ready?” 
For example, this revolution will undoubtedly lead to the engineering of life through synthetic biology, a prospect that remains controversial. 
Likewise, epigenetics (the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without altering the DNA sequence) has reshaped the old nature-versus-nurture debate by highlighting the multi-dimensional character of the relationship between biological and social development. 
The growing understanding of transgenerational epigenetic modifications, whether nutritional or neurological, has opened new perspectives on the plasticity of the phenotype (an organism’s observable characteristics), and the factors that might affect it. 
As a result, it is now clear that people’s lifestyles do not concern only themselves. 
These developments – and the questions that they raise – underscore the need to redraw the map of the sciences. 
A more integrated research agenda that includes the social sciences is crucial to ensuring that the promise of genetic research benefits all. 
In fact, such research is integral to improving upon the factors that contribute most to a society’s wealth: health, education, and ethics. 
Indeed, more encompassing knowledge of personal genomics can engender a new sense of commonality. 
With a better understanding of people’s relationships to each other – from the impact that one’s lifestyle could have on the health of future generations to the corrosive effects of existing inequalities and the concomitant risk of a new genetic divide – a healthier, more equal society could be created. 
But realizing this vision requires accounting for the different choices that people make within a pluralistic society. 
To this end, the collaboration of social and scientific institutions would help to break down language and cultural barriers, ensuring that the genomic revolution aids, rather than alienates, the public, and thereby passes the true test of any scientific advancement: relevance to everyday experience. 
In a world characterized by multiple, overlapping crises, people need to see, understand, and identify with what genetics has to offer. 
When asked what should keep us awake at night, the economist Amartya Sen answered, “The tragedies that we can prevent, the injustice that we can repair.” Applying scientific advances to the prevention of tragedy and the redress of injustice fulfills science’s core promise. 
Strengthening the real-world role of genetics is an essential step in that direction. 
The Reality of Virtual Power 
DAVOS – As Arab regimes struggle with demonstrations fueled by Twitter and Al Jazeera, and American diplomats try to understand the impact of WikiLeaks, it is clear that this global information age will require a more sophisticated understanding of how power works in world politics. 
That is the argument of my new book, The Future of Power. 
Two types of power shifts are occurring in this century – power transition and power diffusion. 
The transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern, but power diffusion is a more novel process. 
The problem for all states today is that more is happening outside the control of even the most powerful of them. 
As for power transition, much attention nowadays is lavished on a supposed American decline, often with facile historical analogies to Britain and Rome. 
But Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the apogee of its power, and, even then, it did not succumb to the rise of another state, but suffered a death by a thousand cuts inflicted by various barbarian tribes. 
Indeed, for all the fashionable predictions that China, India, or Brazil will surpass the United States in the coming decades, the greatest threats may come from modern barbarians and non-state actors. 
In an information-based world of cyber-insecurity, power diffusion may be a greater threat than power transition. 
What will it mean to wield power in the global information age of the twenty-first century? 
Which resources will produce power? 
Every age produces its own answers. 
In the sixteenth century, control of colonies and gold bullion gave Spain the edge; seventeenth-century Holland profited from trade and finance; eighteenth-century France gained from its larger population and armies; and nineteenth-century British power rested on industrial and naval primacy. 
Conventional wisdom has always held that the state with the largest military prevails. 
In an information age, however, it may be the state (or non-state) with the best story that wins. 
Today, it is far from clear how to measure a balance of power, much less how to develop successful survival strategies for this new world. 
Most current projections of a shift in the global balance of power are based primarily on one factor: projections of countries’ GDP growth. 
They thus ignore the other dimensions of power, including both hard military power and the soft power of narrative, not to mention the policy difficulties of combining them into successful strategies. 
States will remain the dominant actor on the world stage, but they will find the stage far more crowded and difficult to control. 
A much larger part of their populations than ever before has access to the power that comes from information. 
Governments have always worried about the flow and control of information, and the current period is not the first to be strongly affected by dramatic changes in information technology. 
What is new – and what we see manifested in the Middle East today – is the speed of communication and the technological empowerment of a wider range of actors. 
The current information age, sometimes called the “Third Industrial Revolution,” is based on rapid technological advances in computers, communications, and software, which in turn have led to a dramatic fall in the cost of creating, processing, transmitting, and searching for information of all kinds. 
And this means that world politics can no longer be the sole province of governments. 
As the cost of computing and communication comes down, the barriers to entry decline. 
Individuals and private organizations, ranging from corporations to NGOs to terrorists, have thus been empowered to play a direct role in world politics. 
The spread of information means that power will be more widely distributed, and informal networks will undercut the monopoly of traditional bureaucracy. 
The speed of Internet time means that all governments will have less control over their agendas. 
Political leaders will enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events, and then will have to compete with an increasing number and variety of actors in order to be heard. 
We see this as American policymakers struggle to cope with today’s Middle East disturbances. 
The fall of the Tunisian regime had deep domestic roots, but the timing caught outsiders, including the US government, by surprise. 
Some observers attribute the acceleration of the revolution to Twitter and WikiLeaks. 
As the Obama administration formulates policy towards Egypt and Yemen, it faces a dilemma. 
In Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime has provided important assistance in dealing with the threat from Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorism. 
In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak’s rule helped to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and balanced Iranian power in the region. 
Simplistic endorsement of democracy by George W. Bush’s administration was costly both in Iraq and in Gaza, where elections gave rise to a hostile Hamas-led government. 
In an information age, smart policy combines hard and soft power. 
Given what the US is, the Obama administration cannot afford to neglect the soft-power narrative of democracy, liberty, and openness. 
Thus, Obama and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have issued public as well as private appeals for reform and change in Egypt and the wider Arab world, while also urging limits to violence by all parties. 
Moreover, they have aligned themselves with freedom of information in the face of efforts by the Egyptian regime to block Internet access. 
How events in the Middle East will play out is anyone’s guess, but in today’s information age, upholding the freedom to access it will be an important component of smart power. 
Vladimir Putin’s Potemkin Love Life 
MOSCOW – From Russia with love? 
Not in Vladimir Putin’s Russia. 
In recent days, Putin decided to reaffirm the Russian-Syrian geopolitical marriage of convenience by following through on a sale of deadly arms to Bashar al-Assad’s regime, enabling Assad’s army to slay his opponents with greater precision and resolve. Putin then decided to disavow his own marriage to Lyudmila Shkrebneva, his wife of 29 years, announcing the divorce in as publicly humiliating a way as possible – his wife was standing by his side – for a reserved Russian woman. 
For years, rumors had persisted about the failed state of Putin’s marriage. 
His alleged mistresses were named and proclaimed; one, it is said, sits in the Duma (parliament) as a member of Putin’s tame political party United Russia. 
But, until now, it was taboo to discuss Putin’s private life publically. 
A few newspaper editors, indeed, have been known to lose their jobs for publishing even the slightest hints about Putin’s family life. 
Vladimir and Lyudmila have rarely been seen together over the past decade, so there was plenty of gossip in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. 
A few years ago, social media stoked rumors that Putin was in fact already divorced and had remarried the gymnast Alina Kabaeva, who had given birth to his son. 
(He has two grown daughters, twins, with Lyudmila.) 
So the appearance of the couple together at a ballet in the Kremlin was a unique event, and Putin milked it for all it was worth. 
A journalist, probably in connivance with Putin, had the temerity to ask him about the state of his marriage. 
He said it was over, with his stone-faced wife on hand to confirm with a silence that spoke louder than words. 
Why make such a public and staged announcement? 
After all, in Putin’s Russia, the latter-day czar can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. 
One suggestion is that Putin is seeking to divert attention from his support for Syria’s government and from increased repression of his domestic opponents (as the leading economist Sergei Guriev’s recent flight from Russia, following police harassment, demonstrated anew). 
With a woman who, unlike Lyudmila, will be regularly seen at his side in the future, Putin will present a gentler image at home and abroad. 
If Russians – particularly provincial Russian women – believe that a new First Lady will provide some humanizing, empathetic influence on the hard man of the Kremlin, they may be more inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
This could prove important as he initiates yet another bogus show trial – this time of the anti-corruption activist Aleksei Navalny, now accused of embezzlement. 
But whether a new woman will help to soften foreigners’ perception of Putin’s cynical diplomacy and increasingly brutal rule is open to question. 
Or, it is said, perhaps Putin plans to use next year’s Winter Olympics in Sochi as a grandiose setting for a marriage proposal – and perhaps a wedding – to whoever comes next, possibly Kabaeva. 
Another suggestion is that Putin, like many Russians, is partial to all things French. 
He wants to show that, like France’s most famous politicians, he is a worldly dragueur who can “pull” beautiful women. 
If former French President Nicolas Sarkozy could divorce and remarry a world-famous model and singer while in office, a Russian president can, too. 
And Putin has already taken beauty tips from another leading West European Lothario, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, with Putin’s 2010 facelift making his visage as smooth as that of the frequently Botoxed Berlusconi. 
Yet, Italian machismo, with its polished shoes and shiny suits, is different from the more rough-hewn Russian version. 
And no amount of European male panache can mask Putin’s inner brute. 
Indeed, one indication of the openness of a political system is whether or not a leader appears at public functions with his or her spouse. 
It is a demonstration of modernity and equality that even the secretive Chinese and North Korean leadership appear to have learned of late. The “first lady” institution is a sign that democracies see power as something to be shared, as, say, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama do. 
Dictators like Hitler, Stalin, and Kim Il-sung, as iron men of destiny, must stand alone. 
When the Bolsheviks replaced Russia’s oppressive monarchy with communism in 1917, Vladimir Lenin’s “dictatorship of the proletariat” still left room for the leader not only to have a wife, but to let her have a public role. 
Nadezhda Krupskaya, the first Soviet First Lady, performed a suffragist function. 
By contrast, the suicide in 1939 of Stalin’s wife, Nadezhda Allilueva, underscored the reign of terror in the country. 
Nikita Khrushchev’s 1950’s thaw allowed for his wife, Nina, to accompany him on trips abroad, presenting a homey image of communism with a human face. 
But, with Khrushchev’s fall, Soviet first ladies returned to the dacha. 
Leonid Brezhnev concealed his wife, Viktoria, from public view throughout the 1970’s, and Yuri Andropov’s wife, Tatyana Filipovna, was scarcely known until his funeral in 1984. 
As with everything else in Russia, change in women’s status came with the onset of Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika. 
Gorbachev’s wife, Raisa, stunned the nation not only by appearing in public, but by being fashionable and expressing opinions of her own. 
Boris Yeltsin’s accession to power in independent Russia saw only a partial reversal, with his peasant-gowned wife, Naina, making public appearances at his side every now and then. 
Just as Putin has created a “managed” democracy, Russians can now look forward to a “managed” Kremlin marriage – one that will attempt to flatter and sweeten their kitschy authoritarian leader in his dotage. 
The Recession Dating Game 
STANFORD – The optimism that emerged in the early stages of the recovery from the financial crisis and recession has given way to more sobering assessments of the short-, medium-, and long-run challenges facing the global economy and its constituent national parts. 
In many countries, fears have even arisen of a prolonged period of slow and occasionally negative growth, persistent obstacles to reducing unemployment, and continued economic anxiety; or worse, of a Japanese-style “lost decade” with multiple recessions; or, even worse, of a depression, (which politicians and intellectuals have stoked in an attempt to justify continued massive government intervention in the economy for years to come). 
But are multiple downturns so unusual in periods of severe economic distress? 
It would be useful to know the answer to this question before trying repeatedly to pump up the economy in the short run with costly policies that might worsen longer-run prospects. 
The global recession was severe, unmatched since World War II, with the possible exception of the early 1980’s (when, for example, the unemployment rate in America soared to 10.8% as a by-product of the disinflation from the double-digit price growth of the late 1970’s). 
From the beginning of the crisis in December 2007 to the apparent end of the recession in the summer of 2009, the decline in real GDP in the US was 3.8%. 
All the other G-7 economies (Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom) experienced severe recessions as well during this period. 
Major middle-income trading economies, such as Brazil, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, experienced brief but even sharper declines. 
The downturn was so severe, and lasted so long, that some even used the term “depression,” before settling on “Great Recession.” 
How exactly is a recession defined? 
Different national statistical agencies define, and therefore date, such episodes somewhat differently. 
In the US, recessions are officially dated by a non-partisan, non-profit private research institution, thus wisely depoliticizing the measurement. 
The point at which the economy stops growing is called the “peak,” and the point at which it stops contracting, the “trough.” 
The period from the point at which the economy starts to grow again until the point at which it reaches the previous peak is called the “recovery.” 
Thereafter, growth is labeled an “expansion.” 
For economists, a recession is over when the economy starts to grow. 
The economy falls to the bottom of a well, and then, as soon as it begins to climb itself out, the recession is declared “over,” even though it may be a long climb back to the top. 
Little wonder, then, that ordinary citizens consider a recession over only when the economy has returned to “normal,” which means that incomes are rising and jobs are no longer desperately scarce. 
A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession. 
But sometimes recessions don’t satisfy this rule. 
Neither the 2001 nor the 1974/1975 US recessions met that criterion. 
In addition to real GDP, employment, income, and sales are considered, as are the depth, duration, and diffusion of the downturn throughout the overall economy. 
Sometimes dating a recession is a judgment call. 
America had a brief, sharp recession in 1980, followed by a long and severe one in 1981/1982. 
Many economists believe that it was one major episode, and that is probably the appropriate way to think about it in a broader historical context. 
But the economy did indeed grow in the interim – just barely enough to consider them distinct recessions. 
And, since they were separated by a transition from President Jimmy Carter to President Ronald Reagan, it was politically consequential that two recessions were identified. 
Likewise, the recent recession was officially dated as starting in December, 2007, but it could equally well have been dated as starting in the summer of 2008 because, in the interim, the economy grew. 
Double-dip downturns are more the rule than the exception. 
If we focus on real GDP and define a double dip as a historical sequence in which a period long enough to be declared a recession is followed by a period of recovery, and then quickly followed by a second outright recession, the 1980-1982 period in the US is a classic example. 
In fact, defined more loosely as a sequence that includes periods of growth followed by periods of decline, followed by further periods of growth and decline, the 1973-1975 period in the US, with eight quarters of alternating gains and losses in real GDP, was one quadruple-dip recession. 
These are not rare occurrences. 
Around the same time, Germany had this type of double dip and the UK a quadruple dip. 
In the early 1980’s, the UK, Japan, Italy, and Germany all had double dips. 
America’s 2001 recession was one brief, mild double dip. 
Within the current recession, we have already had a double dip; a dip at the beginning of 2008, then some growth, then another long, deep dip, then renewed growth. 
If the economy declines again – a highly plausible prospect – we would have a triple dip, although perhaps not an outright second recession. 
So history suggests that economies seldom grow out of recessions continuously, without an occasional subsequent decline. 
Double dips, triple dips, and quadruple dips have been America’s recessionary experience since WWII. 
And similar episodes have been common in many other countries. 
The Red and the Blue 
Condoleeza Rice’s replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretary of State shows that America’s recent presidential election continues to produce powerful reverberations. 
But understanding what that election tells us about America is important not only for Americans, but for the world. 
This year’s presidential vote proves that America’s democracy is healthy, but that some things could be better. 
Contrary to the election in 2000, when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College, Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes. 
While some Democrats remain bitter, there is little serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush’s victory. 
America remains closely divided into red states (Republican) and blue states (Democrat). 
If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (albeit with a minority of the popular vote). 
The Electoral College was included in America’s constitution to protect small states in a federal system, but it now means that the political campaign focuses largely on the dozen or so battleground states where public opinion is closely divided. 
More fundamentally, there is something unseemly about electing presidents without a popular majority. 
So it is time for a serious debate about amending the constitution to abolish the Electoral College. 
Some observers also complain about the divisive negative rhetoric and advertising that characterized the campaign. 
But this should be seen in historical perspective. 
In the era of the Founding Fathers, newspapers were extremely partisan, and George Washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language. 
For much of its early history – to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction – the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition. 
At the same time, despite negative advertising by both sides, the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and were widely viewed. 
In general, an incumbent president with a growing economy is likely to be re-elected. 
In that sense, what was surprising about Bush’s re-election was how thin his majority was. 
In large part, this was because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War. 
Kerry tried to make the war, the low rate of job creation, inadequate healthcare, and Bush’s tax cuts for upper income groups the central issues of the campaign, but some observers felt that this never added up to a clear message. 
Bush countered with concerns about security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion rights. 
In the end, security and cultural populism trumped economic populism. 
Interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked (after they voted) about which issues mattered most to them. 
The largest number (22%) answered “moral values,” comparison to 20% who cited the economy and 19% who mentioned terrorism. 
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term. 
But a Pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category “moral values” encompassed a wide range of issues besides abortion rights and gay marriage. 
In fact, polls show that 25% of the public support gay marriage and 35% favor legal civil unions for gay couples (the position advocated by Kerry). 
Nonetheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage, particularly in the red center of the country, the issue helped mobilize Bush supporters to come to vote. 
A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided. 
The election map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country. 
Some call it “Coastopia.” 
But the division is not that sharp. 
Many states in both camps were won by narrow margins, and if one colors the map at the level of counties rather than states, much of the country looks quite purple. Cities versus suburbs and rural areas is a better description than coasts versus heartland. 
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are clustered in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes. 
But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public. 
At first, this seems puzzling, because they should have an incentive to move to the vote-rich middle. 
But many members of Congress represent districts that are safe for their parties, and the threat to their re-election comes in party primaries that are dominated by the more activist and extreme wings of the parties. 
This tendency is reinforced by the rise of cable television, which attracts viewers by means of contentious “infotainment” programs, and Internet bloggers, who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter. 
Reforms to alter the boundaries of Congressional districts to make them more competitive would help alleviate this problem, but few incumbent Congressmen will vote for changes that might increase their risk of defeat. 
The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe. 
Faced with difficult questions in foreign, fiscal, and social policy, he would be wise to turn toward the center rather than conciliate his conservative base, but it remains unclear whether the politics of conviction or of pragmatism will prevail. 
The Reform Game 
Reform, when long discussed but never implemented, can do far more harm than good. 
Anticipation of a reform – say, of pension rules, the health system, or unemployment benefits – worries everyone who might feel the impact. 
In response, they cut consumption and save more, expecting that sooner or later they will have to start paying for some of the services they had been used to getting free or at subsidized rates. 
But because reform in Europe is usually only discussed, the benefits fail to materialize: people work harder only when they are sure that tax rates are actually cut, and in financial markets the positive effects of lower government spending do not come before any reform is approved. 
In the meantime, as politicians debate and do nothing, consumer confidence falls, economic performance worsens, and the consensus needed to get reforms approved in the first place vanishes. 
Still the talk does not stop, nor does the fall in consumer confidence. 
Germany’s recent experience provides a worrying example of this vicious circle. 
Reform of Germany’s generous social system has claimed the front pages for German papers for more than ten years. 
Some timid measures have been implemented, but the general feeling among Germans is best described by the following answer to a survey conducted two months ago by the newspaper Die Welt : “47% of those interviewed plan to cut consumption due to the uncertainty about pensions and health reform.” 
The result has been a sharp fall in consumer confidence: the German index of consumer sentiment was small but positive in November 2000; it has since fallen to -20, the sharpest decline in the euro area. 
Out on the street, pessimism runs rampant. 
For two years now, the growth rate of private consumption (measured at constant prices) has been negative: - 1% in 2002, -0.5% in 2003. 
Similar declines in real consumption are rare in industrial countries, as in bad years consumers typically draw on their savings to keep their consumption relatively constant. 
In the case of Germany, one has to go back to the early 1980’s to see similar negative numbers in consumption growth. 
As a result, rather than falling, the household saving rate has increased, rising from 9.7% of disposable income in 2000 to 11.8% last year. 
Depressed consumption and higher savings have affected all age groups, but the relatively old have been more prone to the trend than the relatively young. 
The only positive signs in consumption are seen among the youngest households, those headed by people in their early twenties, who evidently hope that sooner or later the reforms will be approved and their tax burden reduced. 
But the saving rate even in households in their thirties has risen along with concern about reforms. 
Not surprisingly, elderly people cut consumption more. 
With retirement, they have lost almost all options: they can no longer work more, nor can they sign up for private health plans – the insurance premiums at their age are too high. 
So they are forced to rely on their savings, and virtually stop consuming. 
Put this in the context of a rapidly aging population and the effects on overall consumption are dramatic. 
Interestingly, France is the only large Euro area country where consumer confidence is growing (from -24 a year ago to -13 today). 
The reason is simple: as the 2006 elections approach, reforms have been shifted off the political agenda. 
If a government does not have the will to adopt a reform program, then the best thing it can do is stop talking about reform altogether. 
This may start happening in Germany and for the same reason: consumer confidence remains lackluster. 
Europe’s economy grew at an anemic 1.8% annual rate in 2004, and the OECD has recently revised downward its growth forecast for next year, from 2.5 to 1.9%, owing to the rising euro and the fall in exports – so far the only driver of the euro area economies. 
The common wisdom is that to faster European growth requires a boost from domestic demand. 
But this will not happen as long as politicians keep talking about reforms, while doing virtually nothing to realize them. 
On the contrary, all they are doing is spreading pessimism. 
Europe has two ways ahead. 
It can forget about reform and enjoy the four or five decades it will take for its per capita income to fall below the level of, say, Chile, or it can deeply change its social model and start growing like the US. 
Doing nothing but talking, which is Europe’s current model of inaction, is the worst possible course. 
The Refugee Dilemma 
One reason Greek Cypriots rejected last April UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan for the reunification of Cyprus was that an overwhelming majority of them felt it did not do justice to the claims of refugees displaced during the 1974 Turkish invasion. 
This was also one of the few occasions when international public opinion became aware that there was a refugee problem on the island, because few people knew that refugees from that war still exist. 
When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an abortive attempt by the Greek military junta in Athens to carry out Enosis (unification with Greece), 250,000 or so Greek Cypriots were uprooted from their homes. 
Some fled in terror from the invading army, some were expelled - the usual complex, morally problematic picture that emerges in such situations. 
Although overwhelmed, the Greek Cypriot community reacted with humanity, solidarity, and prudence. 
Initially, refugees camps were set up, but the Greek Cypriot government decided that while it will not surrender the refugees' claim eventually to return to their homes in the North, it would do its utmost in the interim not to leave them vegetating in squalid camps. 
No UN-sponsored refugee agency was established to help the refugees. 
Instead, with some international help, but mostly out of its own resources, the Republic of Cyprus - a small, then not very prosperous country that was devastated by war - launched a re-settlement and rehabilitation program as a national project. 
Government loans were offered for housing construction. 
In many cases, refugees built their own new homes. 
Businesses were encouraged with government subsidies and loans. 
Schools and training centers were established. 
Within a few years, the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern, Greek Cypriot sector of the island. 
As in post-World War II West Germany, much of the current prosperity in Cyprus today is an outcome of the boost the economy received from the absorption of refugees. 
Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps: most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees. 
The Greek Cypriot community can justly be proud of the way they handled the humanitarian and social problems of the refugees, without at any point surrendering their claims to the lands they lost. 
Equally commendable has been the Greek Cypriot strategic decision to follow a Gandhi-like policy of non-violence: while there is deep bitterness about the Turkish occupation, and the fact that Turkish settlers were implanted in the North, the Greek Cypriot community decided not to use violence against the occupation. 
Not one incident of Greek Cypriot terrorism or violence against Turkish occupation has occurred in more than a quarter of a century. 
This is also one of the reasons few people have ever heard about the Greek Cypriot refugees. 
It could, of course, be different: had Greek Cypriots followed the Palestinian example since 1948 - that is, kept the refugees in camps, segregated them from the non-refugee society, and fed their children a daily militaristic message of hatred, revenge, and terrorism - a completely different atmosphere would permeate the island. 
The Greek Cypriot example shows that it is simply not true that the occupied have no recourse other than violence and terrorism. 
Recourse to violence and terror is a moral and strategic choice. 
The Greek Cypriots chose the path of non-violence; the Palestinians chose the opposite route. 
There is always a choice, and there are always consequences. 
Consider what the Greek Cypriot community has achieved - a thriving economy, no one living under conditions of misery and humiliation in camps, membership in the European Union - compared to the catastrophe the Palestinian choice has brought to their own people. 
Perhaps on the level of public relations, the Palestinian leadership - sacrificing their own people on the altar of propaganda - can bask in their achievement: yet it is their own people who suffer. 
These leaders would do better to look across the Mediterranean at Cyprus and see how - without giving up claims to disputed land - refugees can live in dignity and honor. 
But then again, the Republic of Cyprus is a democracy, while the Palestinians have not been able to emancipate themselves from the violent militarized option that has brought them such misery. 
The Relative Unimportance of Global Warming 
Global warming has become the preeminent concern of our time. 
Many governments and most campaigners meeting in Montreal now throughDecember 9tell us that dealing with global warming should be our first priority. 
Negotiating a follow-up treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, they argue, requires that we seek even deeper cuts in the pollution that causes global warming. 
But they are wrong about our priorities, and they are advocating an inefficient remedy. 
As a result, we risk losing sight of tackling the world’s most important problems first, as well as missing the best long-term approach to global warming. 
To be sure, global warming is real, and it is caused by CO2. 
The trouble is that today’s best climate models show that immediate action will do little good. 
The Kyoto Protocol will cut CO2 emissions from industrialized countries by 30% below what it would have been in 2010 and by 50% in 2050. 
Yet, even if everyone (including the United States) lived up to the protocol’s rules, and stuck to it throughout the century, the change would be almost immeasurable, postponing warming for just six years in 2100. 
Likewise, the economic models tell us that the cost would be substantial ­– at least $150 billion a year. 
In comparison, the United Nations estimates that half that amount could permanently solve all of the world’s major problems: it could ensure clean drinking water, sanitation, basic health care, and education for every single person in the world, now. 
Global warming will mainly harm developing countries, because they are poorer and therefore more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. 
However, even the most pessimistic forecasts from the UN project that by 2100 the average person in developing countries will be richer than the average person in developed countries is now. 
So early action on global warming is basically a costly way of doing very little for much richer people far in the future. 
We need to ask ourselves if this should, in fact, be our first priority. 
Of course, in the best of all worlds, we would not need to prioritize. 
We could do all good things. 
We would have enough resources to win the war against hunger, end conflicts, stop communicable diseases, provide clean drinking water, broaden educational access, and halt climate change. 
But we don’t. 
So we have to ask the hard question: if we can’t do it all, what should we do first? 
Some of the world’s top economists – including four Nobel laureates – answered this question at the Copenhagen Consensus in 2004, listing all major policies for improving the world according to priority. 
They found that dealing with HIV/AIDS, hunger, free trade, and malaria were the world’s top priorities. 
This was where we could do the most good for our money. 
On the other hand, the experts rated immediate responses to climate change at the bottom of the world’s priorities. 
Indeed, the panel called these ventures – including the Kyoto Protocol – “bad projects,” simply because they cost more than the good that they do. 
The Copenhagen Consensus gives us great hope because it shows us that there are so many good things that we can do. 
For $27 billion, we could prevent 28 million people from getting HIV. 
For $12 billion we could cut malaria cases by more than a billion a year. 
Instead of helping richer people inefficiently far into the future, we can do immense good right now. 
This does not mean losing sight of the need to tackle climate change. 
But the Kyoto approach focuses on early cuts, which are expensive and do little good. 
Instead, we should be concentrating on investments in making energy without CO2 emissions viable for our descendants. 
This would be much cheaper and ultimately much more effective in dealing with global warming. 
The US and Britain have begun to tout this message. 
The parties in Montreal should rule out more Kyoto-style immediate cuts, which would be prohibitively expensive, do little good, and cause many nations to abandon the entire process. 
Rather, they should suggest a treaty binding every nation to spend, say, 0.1% of GDP on research and development of non-carbon-emitting energy technologies. 
This approach would be five times cheaper than Kyoto and many more times cheaper than a Kyoto II. 
It would involve all nations, with richer nations naturally paying the larger share, and perhaps developing nations being phased in. 
It would let each country focus on its own future vision of energy needs, whether that means concentrating on renewable sources, nuclear energy, fusion, carbon storage, or searching for new and more exotic opportunities. 
Such a massive global research effort would also have potentially huge innovation spin-offs. 
In the long run, such actions are likely to make a much greater impact on global warming than Kyoto-style responses. 
In a world with limited resources, where we struggle to solve just some of the challenges that we face, caring more about some issues means caring less about others. 
We have a moral obligation to do the most good that we possibly can with what we spend, so we must focus our resources where we can accomplish the most first. 
By this standard, global warming doesn’t come close. 
Rather than investing hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term, ineffective cuts in CO2 emissions, we should be investing tens of billions in research, leaving our children and grandchildren with cheaper and cleaner energy. 
The Renminbi Goes Forth 
BEIJING – In June, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC), China’s central bank, announced an end to the renminbi’s 23-month-old peg to the dollar and a return to the pre-crisis exchange-rate regime adopted in July 2005. 
So far, however, the RMB’s appreciation against the dollar has been slow. 
Will the pace of appreciation accelerate enough to satisfy American demands? 
If it does, will global imbalances disappear sooner? 
It is hard to argue that the RMB is not undervalued, given China’s large and persistent current-account and capital-account surpluses. 
But, despite ending the dollar peg, faster appreciation of the RMB seems unlikely for the foreseeable future. 
China’s official position is that, to avoid the negative impact of a stronger RMB on China’s exports and hence employment, appreciation must proceed in an autonomous, gradual, and controllable manner. 
The current exchange-rate regime, which links the RMB to a basket of currencies, was designed to give the PBC leeway to control the pace of RMB appreciation, while creating two-way fluctuations in the exchange rate against the US dollar in order to discourage speculators from making one-way bets on the RMB. 
RMB appreciation should have started earlier and at a faster pace, when China’s trade surplus was much smaller and its growth was much less dependent on exports. 
Delay has made current-account rebalancing via RMB appreciation costly. 
And now China faces a dilemma. 
As a result of the global financial crisis, China’s export growth in 2009 dropped by 34% compared to 2008. 
In the first seven months of 2010, China’s trade surplus was $84 billion, down 21.2% from January-July 2009. 
This large, steady fall in the country’s trade surplus makes the Chinese government hesitant to allow the RMB to appreciate significantly, for fear of the lagged impact on the trade balance. 
But the PBC is also reluctant to buy dollars constantly. 
The PBC knows that rapid deterioration in America’s fiscal position and continual worsening in its external balance may create an irresistible temptation for the US to inflate away its debt burden. 
The more the PBC intervenes, the larger the national welfare losses that China may suffer in the future. 
The Chinese government must, therefore, strike a balance between protecting China’s export sector and preserving its national welfare. 
The dilemma that officials face is that the impact of a fall in exports as a result of RMB appreciation will be felt acutely and immediately, whereas the large welfare losses due to the evaporation of the value of China’s foreign-exchange reserves will be borne by society as a whole – but not immediately. 
Moreover, the increase in China’s overall price level – and wage levels in particular – has caused the RMB to strengthen steadily in real terms, reducing (to a certain extent) the need for nominal RMB appreciation. 
True, commerce ministry officials recently declared their wish to see a further fall of China’s trade surplus in 2010. 
But RMB appreciation is not the preferred instrument for achieving this goal. 
Thus, nothing dramatic will happen to the RMB exchange rate in the near term – unless something dramatic happens. 
At the same time, the effect of currency appreciation on the trade balance should not be exaggerated. 
The RMB appreciated by 18.6% in real effective terms, and by 16% in dollar terms, from June 2005 to August 2008. 
Yet, from 2006 to 2008, China’s annual exports grew 23.4%, outpacing import growth of 19.7%. 
Exchange rates are just one of many factors that affect trade balances. 
For China’s, the income effect of global demand is significantly larger than the price effect of the exchange rate. 
The fall in China’s trade surplus since late 2008 is attributable mainly to the global slowdown and the stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government, rather than to changes in the RMB’s exchange rate. 
But if the RMB is allowed to float, isn’t a balanced trade account likely? 
Probably not. 
With a fast-rising RMB, net capital outflows will increase, which is what Japan experienced after the Plaza Accord of 1985 pushed the yen upward. 
As a result, balance-of-payments equilibrium would be reached at a certain exchange-rate level, but a current-account surplus (albeit smaller) would still exist. 
America should not pin too much hope on a weakening dollar to correct its trade imbalances. 
For the US, the fundamental cause of imbalances is not a strong dollar, but America’s over-consumption and over-borrowing. 
A strengthening dollar would worsen the US trade balance, but a weakening dollar could cause panic in capital markets, which might push up risk premia on dollar-denominated assets, including US government securities, in turn leading to an economic slowdown and a further weakening of the dollar. 
Of course, RMB appreciation may displace Chinese goods sold in the US. 
But if the US fails to narrow its savings gap, its current-account deficit will not disappear, regardless of where the dollar goes. 
Whether America can achieve decent growth while keeping its current-account deficit in check depends on whether it can reinvigorate its ability to innovate and create, thereby restoring competitiveness and creating demand at the same time. 
For both China and America, the RMB-dollar exchange rate is important for achieving growth and a more balanced current account. 
But that dual objective requires structural change in the Chinese and US economies. 
The Resisted Rise of Segolene Royal 
Two months ago, Paris’s political insiders were unanimous: the presidential race was still open, but Ségolène Royal was clearly the favorite. 
Today, the reverse seems true. 
While the race is not over, Nicolas Sarkozy has emerged as the consistent favorite in the polls, as well as of those who declared “him” nearly defeated in early December. 
The new consensus can be described as follows: Ségolène Royal cannot defeat Nicolas Sarkozy, but Sarkozy can defeat himself. 
Why has the Socialist candidate, the first woman who had a serious chance to be elected President of France, fallen from grace so quickly? 
And why has Sarkozy proved to be so resilient, despite the often negative passions aroused by his personality? 
If Ségolène Royal is defeated, it will not be because she is a woman, but in spite of it. 
The French are ready for a woman, but perhaps not this one. 
She is beautiful, energetic, resolute, and in many ways surprising. 
Indeed, on issues such as law and order, respect for authority, and nationalism, one finds her positions far from what one would expect of a Socialist candidate. 
But Royal has so far failed to rally her camp behind her. 
Her campaign’s combination of authoritarianism and confusion, if not sheer incompetence, is sapping her supporters’ morale while confirming the deep reservations of her opponents. 
Whatever their political preferences, many French voters have the feeling that an “amateur” is facing a “professional.” 
Whereas Sarkozy has managed to impose himself on the right without the support of Jacques Chirac, the Socialist heavyweights cannot fully convince themselves to come out behind Royal. 
Her defeat would be theirs, too, but their resentment over losing the nomination to her is so far proving stronger than their political survival instincts. 
Royal’s emphasis on the concept of participatory democracy – “Tell me what you want, I will be your spokesperson” – has so far shown itself to have limited appeal. 
Voters like to be consulted, and citizens love to express themselves, but at the end of the day, they want a leader, someone they can trust. 
In other terms, they don’t want only a receptive ear, but a reassuring, authoritative, and competent figure. 
Two months before the vote, the presidential campaign has demonstrated that the modernization, if not “Americanization,” of French politics (for example, heavy use of the Internet) has taken hold. 
But the campaign is also proving the resilience of “classical politics.” 
Royal may have presented herself as a “post-modern” politician, but it is a “classical” politician who seems to be winning. 
At the same time, Sarkozy has been able to emerge as the natural leader of the right partly because Chirac has been less of a liability than many people, including the experts, predicted. 
Indeed, the reverse seems to be true, which perhaps reflects the tendency of French voters to adopt a positive view of departing presidents. 
Chirac himself has orchestrated his departure with a grace, presenting himself in the best possible light with personal confidences and public speeches. 
It is as if France were now seized by a kind of nostalgic generosity toward a presidency that had been marked by suspicion and derision. 
Chirac is not about to present himself as a candidate to divide the conservative camp, and the new leniency surrounding his record may actually benefit Sarkozy, his impatient and rebellious heir. 
Yet opposition to Sarkozy remains high, and not only among minorities and young people, who have registered to vote in high numbers, supposedly to oppose him and his heavy use of the police in the banlieues . “Bonaparte” may be about to triumph easily over “Joan of Arc,” as some foreign commentators like to describe the two leading candidates, but Sarkozy’s supposedly “Bonapartist” qualities have fueled a potent sense of apprehension. 
In fact, the persistence of strong reservations about both Royal and Sarkozy helps explain the surge in popularity for a third candidate, Francois Bayrou, a traditional centrist, pro-European politician. 
Bayrou has never had it so good, but, barring the unlikely collapse of one of the two leading candidates’ campaigns, he will fail to qualify for the second-round runoff. 
In our media-dominated age, personalities ultimately matter more than programs, which means that elimination prevails over selection. 
That process seems to favor Sarkozy. 
An anybody-but-Sarkozy reflex may exist in some circles of French society, but, in order to prevail, a credible alternative is required. 
So far, Royal has failed to play that role. 
The Resistible Rise of Hindu Fascism 
In the 1930s, Hitler rose to power as the world focussed on Mussolini's African wars and Japan's invasion of China. 
As the world concentrates on the war in Iraq, it should keep a watchful eye on India, suggests the novelist Arundhati Roy, because a form of Hindu fascism is growing ever stronger in the subcontinent. 
One night a year ago, a friend called me. 
Weeping, she told me of her friend, a woman caught by a mob, her stomach ripped open and stuffed with burning rags. 
What Hindu scripture preaches this? 
India's Prime Minister, A. B. Vajpayee, justified that deed as part of the retaliation meted out by outraged Hindus against the Muslim "terrorists" who had incinerated 58 Hindus on a train to Godhra. 
What Koran verse required those travellers to be roasted alive? 
The more India's Hindus and Muslims call attention to their differences by slaughtering each other, the less there is that distinguishes them. 
They worship at the same altar, apostles of the same murderous god, whoever he is. 
A year after the Godhra massacre and the subsequent anti-Muslim pogroms in Gujarat province, India is again sipping from its poisoned chalice - a flawed democracy laced with religious fascism. 
In parliament, the government has unveiled a portrait of Vinayak Savarkar, a pre-independence Hindu nationalist, one of whose followers assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. 
The drive to build a temple to the god Ram in Ayodhya, on the site of a 16 th century mosque demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, is gaining new energy. 
But once Muslims are "shown their place," will milk and Coca-Cola flow across the land? 
Or will some fresh hate arise? 
Will its target be Adivasis, Buddhists, Christians, Dalits, Parsis, Sikhs? 
Those who speak English? 
Those with thick lips? 
What depraved vision imagines India without the spectacular anarchy of its many cultures? 
The parallels between contemporary India and pre-Nazi Germany are chilling, but not surprising. 
Many Hindu nationalists are frank about their admiration for Hitler. 
Luckily, we don't yet have a Hitler. 
Instead, we have, the hydra-headed Sangh Parivar - the "joint family" of Hindu political/cultural organizations. 
Sangh Parivar's genius is its ability to be all things to all people. 
While the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Congress) exhorts its cadres to prepare for the Final Solution, Prime Minister Vajpayee assures the nation that all citizens, regardless of religion, are treated equally. 
Of course, every kind of pogrom - against castes, tribes, religions - has been seen here. 
In 1984, following Indira Gandhi's assassination, the ruling Congress Party presided over the massacre of 3,000 Sikhs. 
Indeed, on virtually every politically volatile issue--from nuclear testing to communal conflict - Congress sowed the seeds and Vajpayee's nationalist BJP party reaps the hideous harvest. 
But whereas Congress whipped up communal hatred undercover and in shame, communal division is part of Sangh Parivar's mandate. 
For years it has injected a slow-release poison into society. 
Hundreds of thousands of children and young people are being weaned on religious hatred and falsified history. 
Their curriculum is as dangerous as that found in the Pakistani and Afghani madrassas that spawned the Taliban. 
Whenever hostility between India and Pakistan is cranked up, hostility toward Muslims grows. 
Increasingly, Indian nationalism means Hindu nationalism, which is based not on self-respect, but on a hatred of the "Other" - not just Pakistanis, but all Muslims. 
The incipient, creeping fascism that results has been groomed by our "democratic" institutions. 
Everything flirts with it--parliament, the press, the police, and the administration. 
If any institution (including the Supreme Court) exercises unfettered, unaccountable power, the erosion of civil liberties, and the spread of day-to-day injustices, fascism will not be far behind. 
Fighting religious fascism means winning back minds and hearts. 
It means demanding accountability from public institutions and listening to the powerless. 
It means fighting dispossession and the everyday violence of poverty. 
It means not allowing newspapers and TV to be hijacked by spurious passions and staged theatrics designed to divert attention from everything else. 
It does not mean banning communally minded madrassas, but rather working toward the day when they are voluntarily abandoned. 
Like termites, India's Hindu fascists have weakened the foundations of our constitution, parliament, and the courts - the backbone of every democracy. 
But it's futile to blame politicians and demand from them a morality of which they are incapable. 
If India's politicians let us down, it is because we allowed it. 
Our fascists didn't create today's grievances. 
Every strategy for real social change and greater social justice - land reform, education, public health, equitable distribution of natural resources - was cunningly scuttled by those castes and people with a stranglehold on politics. 
Fascist Hindus seized upon these grievances, mobilizing people by using the lowest common denominator - religion. 
People who lost control of their lives, people uprooted from home and community, stripped of culture and language, are made to feel proud of something . 
Not of something they achieved, but of something they happen to be. Or, more accurately, something they happen not to be. 
Unfortunately, no quick fix exists. 
Fascism can be defeated only if those outraged by it commit themselves to social justice with an intensity that equals their indignation. 
If we do not, we ordinary Indians will find ourselves--like the ordinary citizens of Hitler's Germany - unable to look our children in the eye because of our shame of what we allowed to happen. 
The Resource Curse Revisited 
There is a curious phenomenon that economists call the resource curse - so named because, on average, countries with large endowments of natural resources perform worse than countries that are less well endowed. 
Yet some countries with abundant natural resources do perform better than others, and some have done well. 
Why is the spell of the resource curse cast so unequally? 
Thirty years ago, Indonesia and Nigeria - both dependent on oil - had comparable per capita incomes. 
Today, Indonesia's per capita income is four times that of Nigeria. 
Indeed, Nigeria's per capita income (as measured in constant dollars circa 1995) has fallen. 
A similar pattern holds true in Sierra Leone and Botswana. 
Both are rich in diamonds. 
Yet Botswana averaged 8.7% annual economic growth over the past thirty years, while Sierra Leone plunged into civil strife. 
The failures in the oil-rich Middle East are legion. 
Economists put forward three reasons for the dismal performance of some richly endowed countries: 
• First, the prospect of riches orients official efforts to seizing a larger share of the pie, rather than creating a larger pie. 
The result of this wealth grab is often war. 
At other times simple rent-seeking behavior by officials, aided and abetted by outsiders, is the outcome. It is cheaper to bribe a government to provide resources at below-market prices than to invest and develop an industry, so it is no surprise that some firms succumb to this temptation. 
• Second, natural resource prices are volatile, and managing this volatility is hard. 
Lenders provide money when times are good, but want their money back when, say, energy prices plummet. 
(As the old adage has it, banks only like to lend to those who do not need money.) 
Economic activity is thus even more volatile than commodity prices, and much of the gains made in a boom unravels in the bust that follows. 
• Third, oil and other natural resources, while perhaps a source of wealth, do not create jobs by themselves, and unfortunately, they often crowd out other economic sectors. 
For example, an inflow of oil money often leads to currency appreciation - a phenomenon called the Dutch Disease . 
The Netherlands, after its discovery of North Sea gas and oil, found itself plagued with growing unemployment and workforce disability (many of those who could not get jobs found disability benefits to be more generous than unemployment benefits.) 
When the exchange rate soars as a result of resource booms, countries cannot export manufactured or agriculture goods, and domestic producers cannot compete with an onslaught of imports. 
So abundant natural wealth often creates rich countries with poor people. 
Two thirds of the people in Venezuela, the Latin American country with the largest oil deposits, live in poverty. 
No wonder that they are demanding that the small group of those who benefit from the country's wealth start to share it. 
Fortunately, as we have become aware of these problems, we have learned much about what can be done about them. 
Democratic, consensual, and transparent processes - such as those in Botswana - are more likely to ensure that the fruits of a country's wealth are equitably and well spent. 
We also know that stabilization funds - which set aside some of the money earned when prices are high - can help reduce the economic volatility associated with natural resource prices. 
Moreover, such fluctuations are amplified by borrowing in good years, so countries should resist foreign lenders who try to persuade them of the virtues of such capital flows. 
The Dutch disease, however, is one of the more intractable consequences of oil and resource wealth, at least for poor countries. 
In principle, it is easy to avoid currency appreciation: keep the foreign exchange earned from, say, oil exports out of the country. 
Bring it in only gradually. But in most developing countries, such a policy is viewed as using oil money to help someone else's economy. 
Some countries, notably Nigeria, are trying to implement these lessons. 
Nigeria has proposed creating stabilization funds, and, in the future, it will sell its natural resources in transparent, competitive bidding processes. 
Most importantly, the Nigerians are taking measures to ensure that the fruits of this endowment are invested, so that as the country's natural resources are depleted, its real wealth - fixed and human capital - is increased. 
Western governments can help with common-sense reforms. 
Secret bank accounts not only support terrorism, but also facilitate the corruption that undermines development. 
Similarly, transparency would be encouraged if only payments that are fully documented were tax deductible. 
Violent conflict is fed and its effects worsened by massive sales of arms by Western governments to developing countries. 
This should be stopped. 
Abundant natural resources can and should be a blessing, not a curse. 
We know what must be done. 
What is missing is the political will to make it so. 
The Responsibility to Protect Libyans 
ABU DHABI – Sovereignty is not a license to kill. 
No state can abdicate the responsibility to protect its own people from crimes against humanity, let alone justify perpetrating such crimes itself. 
When a state manifestly fails in that protection, it is the wider international community’s responsibility to provide it by taking “collective, timely, and decisive” action through the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. 
This is the “responsibility to protect” principle, as embraced unanimously by the World Summit of heads of state and government sitting as the UN General Assembly in 2005, and endorsed subsequently by the Security Council. 
There is no clearer case for its application than in Libya today. 
Colonel Muammar Qaddafi’s forces, on the ground and from the sky, have massacred hundreds – perhaps over a thousand – of Libyans protesting, at first peacefully, against the excesses of his regime. 
A bigger bloodbath seems inescapable if he does not step down. 
The need for “collective, timely, and decisive” action is overwhelming. 
The Security Council, after moving with painful caution the first few days of the crisis, has now both invoked the responsibility to protect principle and – in an historic first – agreed on a substantial package of measures to implement it: an arms embargo, asset freeze, travel bans, and, importantly, reference of the situation to the International Criminal Court. 
Such measures, like the steps being taken in the UN Human Rights Council and elsewhere, are necessary to demonstrate that Qaddafi has no remaining international support. 
They are coercive, but they fall short of the threat or use of military force. 
Will they be enough to stop the killing? 
Is it time to apply and enforce a no-fly zone? 
Or to go further still and send in ground forces with a mandate to do what it takes? 
This is a difficult call. 
Not even the most passionate advocate of the responsibility to protect can pretend otherwise. 
Declaring a no-fly zone is not a “soft” option: it must mean being prepared to shoot down any fighters, bombers, or helicopter gunships that breach it. 
That poses a huge risk of hostage-taking or other reprisals against any intervening country’s nationals still in Libya. 
An invasion force, assuming that one could be mustered on short notice, would raise the stakes higher still. 
It is important to keep in perspective what the responsibility to protect is about, and what the principle was designed to achieve. 
The background to its introduction was a decade of gut-wrenching international division in the 1990’s about how to react to mass atrocity crimes, with the global North by and large supporting “humanitarian intervention,” the South rallying to the old cry of non-interference in states’ domestic affairs, and consensus nowhere in sight. 
The result was either UN-authorized action that was erratic, incomplete, or counterproductive – as in the Somalia debacle of 1993, the Rwandan genocide in 1994, and the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 – or action that was eventually effective, but not UN-authorized – and thus unlawful – as in Kosovo in 1999. 
The “responsibility to protect” sought to recast the issue in terms of responsibility rather than rights, and protection rather than intervention, while identifying a wide spectrum of appropriate preventive and reactive responses, with coercive military intervention only a last resort. 
The hope was that states’ failure to protect their inhabitants would no longer be seen as nobody else’s business, as had been the case for centuries, but as the entire world’s concern. 
That part of the job is now fairly well accomplished. 
The global response to the horrors in Kenya in 2008 was a spectacular contrast to the indifference that greeted the butchery in Rwanda. 
And the international condemnation of Qaddafi’s atrocities today has been swift, unqualified, and effectively unanimous. 
Nobody is claiming that sovereignty confers immunity; the shift in the normative consensus is more or less complete. 
But the second great hope of responsibility-to-protect advocates was that this consensus in principle would make agreement on what to do in practice – how to translate normative consensus into action – easier to achieve. 
That has proved harder, as experiences in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sri Lanka have demonstrated. 
Given the complexity and sensitivity of the issues – never more so than when military action is an option – it is not surprising that the responsibility to protect remains a work in progress. 
The lesson is not that the principle is irrelevant, but that we have to do better in applying it in the future – and that future, with Libya, is now. 
Sanctions, embargoes, and diplomatic isolation are the absolute minimum in terms of what is required. 
If these measures do not bite immediately, and the carnage continues, there will be no alternative but to do more. 
Military options should always be a last resort, but they can’t be excluded in extreme cases, and Libya is as extreme as it gets. 
A no-fly zone will be easier to contemplate as the last vulnerable expatriates leave the country, and planning for its application should be rapidly advanced. 
For all that it has done so far, the ball remains in the Security Council’s court. 
Not only is the credibility of the responsibility-to-protect principle at stake, but also its own. 
The Cooperation Crisis 
PARIS – The rise of emerging economies worldwide has generated much optimism, in terms not only of economic development, but also of global cooperation. 
But the shift to a multipolar world order has not bolstered multilateralism. 
In fact, the opposite is true: the logic of national sovereignty has staged a comeback, with major economies consistently undermining cooperation on issues ranging from security to trade to climate change. 
Consider the muddle in the United Nations Security Council over Syria’s civil war. 
Just two years ago, the Council approved a resolution authorizing a military intervention in Libya – the first resolution to implement the “responsibility to protect” (R2P) principle, which the general assembly adopted unanimously in 2005. 
But the emerging powers soon came to believe that the West had used the protection of Libya’s civilian population as a pretext for regime change (though, realistically, it would have been impossible to protect the population without toppling Muammar el-Qaddafi’s government). 
Now, these countries are largely rejecting R2P, viewing it as a device employed by Western governments to legitimize their attempts to infringe upon national sovereignty. 
Brazil has attempted to address the issue by crafting a resolution that would decouple the R2P mandate from the use of force – effectively eliminating the possibility that the doctrine could be applied. 
For their part, Russia and China have blocked three resolutions condemning the Syrian regime, and Russia has worked hard – with evident success – to derail any military intervention in Syria. 
In this sense, Russia and China now exercise de facto control over the formal international legality of the use of force. 
To be sure, many countries ­now believe that the West is going too far in challenging state sovereignty, with even European countries like Germany recoiling at the prospect of military confrontation. 
At the G-20 summit in early September, for example, US President Barack Obama struggled to convince ten states to sign a declaration on Syria that did not even mention the use of force. 
Only the US, the United Kingdom, and France remain willing to use force if it is deemed necessary. 
But viewing intervention in Syria within the paradigm of Western messianism is a mistake. 
After all, in Syria, as in Libya, the forces challenging the government are not a creature of Western manipulation. 
They are indigenous – and they are asking the West for help. 
The legal basis for military intervention may be weak, but Syria is no Iraq, either. 
Security is not the only area where sovereignty concerns have superseded multilateralism. 
In 2008, the US abandoned its commitment to the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round of global trade negotiations. 
While the decision followed a technical disagreement with India, it was driven largely by the belief that any agreement would benefit China more than the US. 
Given that the Doha Round has failed to address the main problems that the US and Europe have encountered in trade relations with China – non-compliance with intellectual-property rules, subsidies for state-owned enterprises, closed government-procurement markets, and limits on access to the services market – both are now emphasizing bilateral trade agreements. 
But, while the world may be happy to pretend that bilateral cooperation will revitalize multilateralism, nobody should be fooled. 
The WTO will survive, but its centrality in the trade system is rapidly diminishing. 
Even cooperation on climate change is crumbling, with the US and China rejecting the multilateral, top-down approach to policymaking. 
This implies the end of the Kyoto Protocol model, which, like the Doha model, is based on a detailed agenda, established according to specific and ambitious targets, with all relevant actors then compelled to negotiate each topic. 
Rather than being subject to an internationally agreed standard, the US and China want the fight against climate change to begin with countries’ individual commitments. 
But this new, bottom-up framework, in which states determine the conditions for a multilateral agreement, lacks an authority to establish standards. 
Multilateralism requires minimal consensus on global rules and norms among all major powers. 
The greater the number of countries that have the power to block or veto international initiatives, the more difficult multilateralism becomes – and the less motivated dominant countries are to cooperate. 
In the emerging multipolar world, characterized by sovereignty concerns and strategic competition, progress toward resolving global issues will be more difficult than ever – with potentially devastating consequences. 
The Retreat of Global Democracy 
A nasty, unintended side-effect of globalization is its corrosive effect on democracy. 
Even if individual countries are becoming more democratic, it seems, the sum of global democracy is shrinking thanks in no small part to globalization. 
Democracy means many things, but at its core it requires that people choose their rulers and that votes be weighted equally. 
But globalization means that nations and peoples can exert an asymmetric influence. 
America can cut off trade with Cuba not only by curtailing its own trade but by threatening punitive action against others who trade or invest in Cuba. 
Cuba, however, can do little to hurt America's economy. 
Likewise, China can injure Taiwan in ways that Taiwan cannot reciprocate. 
Of course, the powerful have always encroached on the sovereignty of others. 
Take the story, perhaps apocryphal, of an Indian diplomat showing a map of South Asia to Stalin. 
"India is a very big country," Stalin observed, and then pointing to Sri Lanka said, "What is the name of this little Indian island?" 
"That is not an Indian island, sir," the diplomat replied, "it is a sovereign nation." 
"Why? "Stalin asked. 
Thanks to globalization, however, dominant nations have a variety of new tools with which to influence other countries short of war. 
Foremost is money. 
Instantaneous electronic links and an improving system of global guarantees allow capital to flow across national boundaries as never before. 
Rapid withdrawal of such capital can have devastating effects, as we saw in 1997 when Asia's super-performing economies succumbed to financial crisis. 
In 1998, during the Asian crisis, the rescue package offered by several industrialized nations - prominently Japan and the US - required Korea to lift bans on imports of certain Japanese products and to open up its banking sector to foreign banks (which is what America wanted). 
People in vulnerable nations have very little say in the imposition of these policies. 
Trade sanctions for political/security ends also serve the same function. 
Another consequence of the freer flow of capital is a greater intertwining of different markets. 
A fall in the Thai housing market can cause the Thai baht to collapse in ways that could not have happened before; a fall in the Indian rupee can cause a meltdown of the Indian stock market in ways inconceivable ten years ago. 
The large presence of overseas investors is the cause here. 
Suppose a New Yorker buys shares in the Mumbai stock market. 
For that, dollars are converted into rupees, which are used to buy shares. 
The aim is not to hold rupees but to make money and eventually re-convert to dollars. 
Suppose, then, that the rupee's exchange rate begins to fall. 
The foreign investor will naturally want to sell off Indian stocks. 
While a fall in the exchange rate with no decline in stock prices gives Indian investors no reason to flee the stock market, if sufficient numbers of foreign investors begin to sell, stock prices will decline so that Indian investors, too, sell their stocks. 
What can be done about the erosion of global democracy and accountability? 
Utopian schemes such as a global government or a global bank answerable to all nations are a distant dream. 
What is needed is a system in which the poor have a voice alongside the rich in the organizations (the IMF, WTO, World Bank, and UN) that mediate in world economics and international relations. 
Today, equity is violated in most international organizations through at least two routes. 
First, there is the open channel, which gives a larger share of votes to the nations contributing more to organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank. 
The second route is the lack of transparency in decision-making. 
In domestic democratic politics, if the decision-making process is visible to all, it becomes difficult for any group to hijack the agenda. 
Big business and the military are able to push through their interests much more in Pakistan than in India because India's government is more open to scrutiny. 
The same goes for international organizations. 
Powerful nations, by virtue of contributing senior personnel and money, gain greater access. 
Decisions taken behind opaque walls are more likely to be diverted to their interests. Take the WTO. 
While it does subscribe to the principle of one-country one-vote, it is widely perceived as a preserve of rich nations. 
This is because of what can be called the "green room" effect, that is, what goes on behind the scenes. 
If the WTO is to be a democratic institution, it must not allow its green room to be hijacked by a few. 
This problem is most obvious when drafting international labor standards. 
Although supposedly designed in the interests of the workers in developing countries, the biggest opposition to them comes from poor countries, and rightly so. 
The form that these standards take - and the increasing talk of using trade sanctions to impose them - is close to what protectionist lobbies in industrial nations seek. 
This is not surprising given the greater access of rich countries. 
The fact that questioning the practices of rich nations (who contribute more funds) exercising more voting power in these organizations sounds outrageous, shows how far away we remain from global democracy. 
After all, it does not seem outrageous that Bill Gates does not have multiple votes in the US elections on the ground that he contributes more to government coffers. Indeed, the suggestion that Gates should have more votes sounds outrageous. 
This is because democracy within a nation is a settled idea. 
Now it is time to provide more equal voting power to nations irrespective of their wealth, because one of the basic tenets of democracy is that the advantages of wealth should not be compounded by giving the rich extra voting power. 
When the idea of "one-person one-vote" arose, feudal landlords predicted chaos in the decision-making process. 
How wrong they were. 
For the sake of global stability, economic efficiency and also the fight against terrorism we must instill greater democracy within our international organizations. 
This may not be in the immediate individual interest of every state, especially big and powerful ones, but is, in the long run, in the enlightened interest of all of humanity collectively. 
The Retreat of Macroeconomic Policy 
BERKELEY – One disturbing thing about studying economic history is how things that happen in the present change the past – or at least our understanding of the past. 
For decades, I have confidently taught my students about the rise of governments that take on responsibility for the state of the economy. 
But the political reaction to the Great Recession has changed the way we should think about this issue. 
Governments before World War I – and even more so before WWII – did not embrace the mission of minimizing unemployment during economic downturns. 
There were three reasons, all of which vanished by the end of WWII. 
First, there was a hard-money lobby: a substantial number of rich, socially influential, and politically powerful people whose investments were overwhelmingly in bonds. 
They had little personally at stake in high capacity utilization and low unemployment, but a great deal at stake in stable prices. 
They wanted hard money above everything. 
Second, the working classes that were hardest-hit by high unemployment generally did not have the vote. 
Where they did, they and their representatives had no good way to think about how they could benefit from stimulative government policies to moderate economic downturns, and no way to reach the levers of power in any event. 
Third, knowledge about the economy was in its adolescence. 
Knowledge of how different government policies could affect the overall level of spending was closely held. 
With the exception of the United States’ free-silver movement, it was not the subject of general political and public intellectual discussion. 
All three of these factors vanished between the world wars. 
At least, that is what I said when I lectured on economic history back in 2007. 
Today, we have next to no hard-money lobby, almost all investors have substantially diversified portfolios, and nearly everybody suffers mightily when unemployment is high and capacity utilization and spending are low. 
Economists today know a great deal more – albeit not as much as we would like – about how monetary, banking, and fiscal policies affect the flow of nominal spending, and their findings are the topic of a great deal of open and deep political and public intellectual discussion. 
And the working classes all have the vote. 
Thus, I would confidently lecture only three short years ago that the days when governments could stand back and let the business cycle wreak havoc were over in the rich world. 
No such government today, I said, could or would tolerate any prolonged period in which the unemployment rate was kissing 10% and inflation was quiescent without doing something major about it. 
I was wrong. That is precisely what is happening. 
How did we get here? 
How can the US have a large political movement – the Tea Party – pushing for the hardest of hard-money policies when there is no hard-money lobby with its wealth on the line? 
How is it that the unemployed, and those who fear they might be the next wave of unemployed, do not register to vote? 
Why are politicians not terrified of their displeasure? 
Economic questions abound, too. 
Why are the principles of nominal income determination, which I thought largely settled since 1829, now being questioned? 
Why is the idea, common to John Maynard Keynes, Milton Friedman, Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher, and Walter Bagehot alike, that governments must intervene strategically in financial markets to stabilize economy-wide spending now a contested one? 
It is now clear that the right-wing opponents to the Obama administration’s policies are not objecting to the use of fiscal measures to stabilize nominal spending. 
They are, instead, objecting to the very idea that government should try to serve a stabilizing macroeconomic role. 
Today, the flow of economy-wide spending is low. 
Thus, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is moving to have the Fed boost that flow by changing the mix of privately held assets as it buys government bonds that pay interest in exchange for cash that does not. 
That is entirely standard. 
The only slight difference is that the Fed is buying seven-year Treasury notes rather than three-month Treasury bills. 
It has no choice: the seven-year notes are the shortest-duration Treasury bonds that now pay interest. 
The Fed cannot reduce short-term interest rates below zero, so it is attempting via this policy of “quantitative easing” to reduce longer-term interest rates. 
Yet America’s right wing objects to this, for reasons that largely remain mysterious: what, at the level of economic theory, is the objection to quantitative easing? 
Blather about Federal Reserve currency manipulation and excessive risk-taking is not worthy of an answer. 
Still, here we are. 
The working classes can vote, economists understand and publicly discuss nominal income determination, and no influential group stands to benefit from a deeper and more prolonged depression. 
But the monetarist-Keynesian post-WWII near-consensus, which played such a huge part in making the 60 years from 1945-2005 the most successful period for the global economy ever, may unravel nonetheless. 
The Return of 1948 
TEL AVIV – The forthcoming United Nation’s conference commemorating the 60th anniversary of UNRWA (The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) could not come at a better moment. 
The restitution of lands occupied in 1967 will obviously continue to be indispensable to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it is the legacy of the 1948 war that both parties to the conflict have now put at the center of the debate. 
Oddly, it was Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who, by requesting that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, reopened the 1948 file. 
That demand brought the quest for peace back to its fundamentals, where the question of the refugees is bound to play a central role. 
Netanyahu’s intention was essentially to force the Palestinians into admitting that the right of return of refugees applies only to the Palestinian state, not Israel. 
But the true significance of his demand lies in that it’s being pronounced at a time when Prime Minister Salam Fayaad’s policies are posing a genuine challenge to the Palestinian national movement to choose between an ethos of vindication and one of state building. 
Under Fayaad, the Palestinian Authority seems to be superseding the Palestinian national movement’s diaspora-based emphasis in favor of state-building within the territorial confines of the occupied territories. 
It is as if the voice of the diaspora were being silenced in Palestine. 
Conspicuously, the recently elected PLO Executive Committee – which in the past consisted exclusively of representatives of the Palestinian Diaspora – now has only one member from the diaspora, a delegate from Lebanon. 
This could mark a sea change in the evolution of Palestinian nationalism. 
In Zionism, the Jewish community in Palestine was the focus of decision making, with the Jewish Diaspora a strategic back-up. 
But the situation was reversed in the case of the Palestinians: the ethos of the diaspora, with the plight of the refugees at its center, has been the beating heart of the Palestinian cause and the focus of decision making for the national movement. 
As a result, the Palestinian community in the occupied territories was always subservient to the primacy of the Palestinian Diaspora. 
When it sought to assume a leading role – during the first Intifada in 1987, for example, its effort was suppressed by the diaspora-based PLO. 
Fayaadism, by contrast, seeks the “Zionization” of the Palestinian national movement. 
It imbues the Palestinian cause with a positive ethos of nation- and state-building by superseding Palestinian nationalism’s diaspora-centered preoccupations – and thereby transcending the paralyzing obsession with a never-fulfilled vindication of rights and justice. 
In the peace process as it has been conducted up to now, the Israelis always wanted to concentrate on the issues of 1967 – that is, land and security. 
The Palestinians, however, always wanted to return to the issues of 1948: refugees, dispersion, and what Akram Hanya, a close Arafat confidant, defined as the need “to make the Israelis face the tribunal of history.” 
It looks as if now the roles have been inversed. 
Precisely when Israel managed to domesticate the Palestinian national movement by forcing it to abandon its revolutionary path in favor of state-building and economic development – a reorientation undertaken by Zionism as well – the Israelis decided to draw the Palestinians back to the fundamentals of the conflict. 
Indeed, despite of the rise of Fayaadism, the Palestinian national movement will be careful not to betray its real sources of legitimacy: the ethos of dispossession and the refugee. 
The decisions taken at the last Fatah Convention were explicit in calling for the refugees to “return to their homes and cities.” 
The Palestinians are attempting to hold the stick at both ends, claiming before the world their endorsement of the two-state solution while calling for the right of return at the same time. 
Any sober Palestinian leadership must know by now that the rhetorical promise of a return to an abandoned house and to the olive tree is an irresponsible mirage that fundamentally contradicts the rationale for a separate Palestinian state. 
Peace is frequently not about justice but about stability. 
The Palestinians must align their national conversation with what is realizable, while Israel must resolve its own contradictions and address the refugee problem in a way that secures the legitimacy and durability of a future peace agreement with the Palestinians. 
Because Israel will have to implement practical measures of resettlement and compensation that will not be based on an automatic right of physical return, a symbol of genuine moral compensation is also called for. 
Instead of suppressing the memory of the refugees, Israel needs to recognize that in 1948 the land was bisected by the sword, and that the Jewish state came into being partly because of the massive uprooting and dispossession of Palestinian communities. 
Israel should develop enough self-confidence in its solidity as a nation to integrate into its schools’ curriculum the tragedy of the Palestinian Naqbah. 
The resolution of conflicts of this nature requires the recovery of historical memory and a proper hearing of the two parties’ historical narratives, perhaps through the creation of Truth and Reconciliation Committees. 
Israel’s consolation would be that the Palestinians, too, will have to come to terms with their share of responsibility for the calamities that have befallen them. 
Only an acceptable deal on the refugees can definitely close the 1948 file – and only then can the conflict in Palestine end. 
The Return of American Realism 
NEW YORK – There are many recurring debates in American foreign policy – for example, isolationism versus internationalism, and unilateralism versus multilateralism. 
But no debate is more persistent than that between those who believe that American foreign policy’s principal purpose should be to influence the external behavior of other states and those who hold that it should be to shape their internal nature. 
This debate between “realists” and “idealists” is intense and long-standing. 
During the Cold War, there were those who argued that the United States should try to “roll back” the Soviet Union, bring down the communist system, and replace it with democratic capitalism. 
Others deemed this to be too dangerous in an era defined by nuclear weapons, and the US opted instead for a policy of containment, working to limit the reach of Soviet power and influence. 
As it turned out, after 40 years of containment, the Soviet Union and its empire unraveled, though this outcome was a byproduct of US policy, not its principal purpose. 
George W. Bush was the most recent “idealist” proponent of making democracy promotion the main priority for US foreign policy. 
Bush embraced the so-called “democratic peace” theory, which holds that democracies not only treat their own citizens better, but also act better toward their neighbors and others. 
It was, of course, his father, George H.W. Bush, who was a strong representative of the alternative, “realist” approach to American foreign policy. 
Much of this debate can be viewed through the lens of American involvement with Iraq. 
George W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 2003 to change the government. 
He expected regime change in Baghdad to lead to a democratic Iraq, a development that would in turn transform the region when people elsewhere in the Arab world saw this example and forced their own governments to follow suit. 
By contrast, in the earlier Iraq war, the first President Bush, after amassing an unprecedented international coalition that succeeded in liberating Kuwait, did not press ahead to Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein and his government, despite the urging of many that he do just that. 
Nor did he intervene on behalf of the Shia and Kurdish uprisings that erupted just after the war ended early in 1991. 
To him, intervention would have placed US soldiers in the midst of a complex domestic struggle, one that would have cost enormous resources to sort out if it could be sorted out at all. 
President Barack Obama appears to agree with this realist approach. 
The new US policy toward Afghanistan makes no mention of trying to transform that country into a democracy. 
On the contrary, as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated before Congress in January, “If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of Central Asian Valhalla over there, we will lose.” 
For his part, Obama said in March that “We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future.” 
This shift is also evident in US policy toward China. 
Speaking during her trip to Asia in February, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made clear that human rights issues would be a secondary concern in US-China relations. 
Similarly, the joint statement issued by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev after their April 1 meeting in London, while mentioning that US-Russia relations would be “guided by the rule of law, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, and tolerance for different views,” placed far greater emphasis on reducing nuclear arms, addressing Iran’s nuclear program, and stabilizing Afghanistan. 
US support for Russia’s admission to the World Trade Organization was unconditional. 
This change in US foreign policy is both desirable and necessary. 
Mature democracies do tend to act more responsibly, but immature democracies can easily succumb to populism and nationalism. 
It is difficult and time-consuming to build mature democracies. 
While encouraging the rule of law and the growth of civil society, the US still needs to work with other governments, democratic and otherwise. 
Pressing problems, such as the economic crisis, nuclear proliferation, and climate change, will not wait. 
The good news is that history shows that it is possible to make peace with and work with non-democracies. 
Israel, for example, has had peaceful relations with non-democratic Egypt and Jordan for more than three decades. 
The US and the Soviet Union cooperated in limited ways (for example, in controlling nuclear arms) despite fundamental differences. 
Today, the US and authoritarian China have mutually beneficial trade and financial ties, and have shown on occasion that they can work together on strategic issues, for example in shaping North Korea’s behavior. 
This is not to say that promoting democracy will have no role in American foreign policy. 
It will, and it should. 
But democracy promotion is too uncertain a proposition, and the world too dangerous a place, for it to occupy center stage in what the United States does. 
Barack Obama’s foreign policy will thus resemble that of George Bush – the father, that is, not the son. 
The Return of Franco-German Leadership 
PARIS – Whoever wins September’s parliamentary election in Germany, the time has come once again for a major Franco-German initiative. 
Regardless of their economic conditions or their confidence – or lack of it – in each other, France and Germany are more than ever jointly responsible for the future, if not the very survival, of the European project. 
Are there alternatives to Franco-German leadership of the European Union? 
Joining Great Britain with them in a Club of Three would be a good idea, but it is out of the question nowadays. 
Britain has largely excluded itself from any leadership role in Europe. 
Gordon Brown is barely surviving as prime minister, and the Conservatives, whose return to power in the next year is almost certain, are as provincially euro-skeptic as ever, if not more so. 
Europe simply cannot count on the British, at least for a while. 
The idea of a Club of Six, floated by Nicolas Sarkozy early in his presidency, was always abstract and is now untenable. 
Given Silvio Berlusconi’s sexcapades, the Italy that he leads cannot be taken seriously, while Spain is out of the running for an EU leadership role, owing to its dire economic conditions. 
As for Poland, although the bumbling Kaczynski “twins” have been removed from power, the country’s fixation on security in its immediate neighborhood is incompatible with true European leadership. 
Since the other 21 EU members never liked the idea of a Club of Six to begin with, it is just as well that such a vision has been buried, probably forever. 
So where but France and Germany can Europe turn for leadership? 
A positive referendum result on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland in October would be a necessary but insufficient condition to jump-start an institutional re-launch of the EU. 
Above all, the EU needs political will and direction. 
Only Germany and France, acting together, can convey to Europe’s citizens and to the world the sense that the EU is at long last waking up to today’s global realities. 
Of course, it is impossible to underestimate the combination of suspicion, tension, and exasperation that characterizes Franco-German relations lately. 
To a large extent, Germany has become a “second France” in Europe, at a time when France is more French than ever. 
And they are not only putting their respective nationalisms first. 
They disagree on fundamentals – most of all, about how to surmount the economic crisis. 
But the two giants of Europe can agree to disagree about the virtues of German-style budgetary rigor or French-style fiscal stimulus as long as they don’t insult each other, and, more importantly, as long as they compensate for their philosophical differences with a well publicized program of joint initiatives on key subjects. 
As long as each remains convinced that no alternative to cooperation exists within the EU, and that European cooperation remains a priority for both, it should not be overly difficult to restore their leadership. 
After all, France and Germany are closer to each other on many key topics than they have been for a long time. 
With the return of France to NATO’s integrated military structure, the two countries are on the same “Atlantic” wavelength for the first time since 1966. 
Despite both sides’ deep reservations about the mission in Afghanistan, they are clearly in the same boat, even if French troops, being closer to British troops in terms of combat, are more vulnerable than the Germans. 
And both countries would probably subscribe to the following formulation: “Turkey’s future is with Europe, but not necessarily in the European Union, at least in the foreseeable future.” 
The fundamental question about how to deal with Russia remains a divisive issue, however. 
France and Germany have different sensitivities on the subject, which is both natural and inevitable, as these differences reflect both geography and history. 
Germany is not only much closer physically to Russia; it is also much more dependent on Russia in terms of energy security. 
France must not delude itself: Germany is not about to convert to nuclear energy to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas. 
Yet Germany also must realize that Russia’s negative evolution has consequences that Germans cannot escape. 
A spectacular Franco-German security initiative following the election in Germany, accompanied by a joint message to the Kremlin, would also have the benefit of sending a message to the rest of the EU, particularly to its Václav Klauses: “If you decide to paralyze the Union through stubborn ill will, you will only end up excluding yourselves, rather than dictating Europe’s fate.” 
Bretton Woods III 
SINGAPORE – Many analysts and observers believe that the global imbalances that characterized the world economy in the years before the 2008 crisis have substantially dissipated. 
But, while it is true that China’s current-account surpluses and America’s deficits have somewhat moderated since then, have the imbalances really been corrected? 
More important, can the post-crisis global economy enjoy both growth and balance? 
To answer these questions, it is important to understand the imbalances’ underlying dynamics. 
An economy’s current account is the difference between its investment rate and its savings rate. 
In 2007, the United States had a savings rate of 14.6% of GDP, but an investment rate of 19.6%, generating a current-account deficit. 
By contrast, China had a fixed investment rate of 41.7% of GDP and a savings rate of 51.9%, reflected in a large surplus. 
Since 2007, the US current-account deficit has narrowed, but not because of a higher savings rate. 
Rather, the external deficit has been squeezed by a collapse in investment activity, while America’s overall savings rate has fallen below 13% of GDP, owing to worsening government finances. 
Meanwhile, China’s savings rate remains stubbornly high. 
The surplus has narrowed because investment has been ramped up even higher, to roughly 49% of GDP. 
In other words, the Americans save even less today than they did before the crisis erupted, and the Chinese invest even more. 
Any future recovery in the US economy will almost certainly trigger a revival in investment activity. 
American businesses have postponed much-needed capital spending and, with American airports and bridges in appalling condition by developed-country standards, investment in infrastructure is crucial as well. 
Indeed, it is very likely that reviving growth will lead to larger current-account deficits, even if the savings rate improves and domestic energy production curtails oil and gas imports. 
China has the opposite problem. 
In order to sustain growth, it needs to continue to invest half of its $9 trillion annual GDP – no easy task for a country that already has brand new highways and airports. 
In fact, over the next decade, as China attempts to move up the value chain into services and adjusts to a shrinking workforce, its investment requirements will shrink – and its investment rate will fall sharply. 
Of course, China’s savings rate will also decline, but Japan’s experience since the 1980’s demonstrates how a sharp fall in investment can generate large and persistent current-account surpluses, even when the savings rate is falling and the currency is appreciating. 
Indeed, a stronger currency can paradoxically feed external surpluses, while discouraging investment in export-oriented industries. 
The implication is that the post-crisis global economy will not be characterized by balance, but by a return to large macroeconomic imbalances. 
But, although many economists will consider this problematic, history shows that symbiotic imbalances have characterized virtually all periods of global economic expansion. 
The Roman Empire ran a persistent trade deficit with India for centuries. 
Although the resulting outflow of gold caused monetary debasement in the Roman Empire, Indo-Roman trade remained the backbone of the global economy. 
Similarly, Spain ran persistent deficits in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, paid for by Andean silver. 
The resulting flood of liquidity caused a global boom that benefited economies from Elizabethan England to Mughal India. 
And 1870-1913, another period of rapid growth and globalization, was not characterized by balance; it was funded by the United Kingdom, acting as the world’s “bank.” 
In the last 60 years, the US has underpinned global growth by running persistent current-account deficits. 
Under the Bretton Woods system, the US ran deficits that enabled war-torn Europe and Japan to rebuild. 
In return, Europe funded the US deficits. 
The system broke down when European countries, particularly France, decided to stop funding those deficits. 
But the economic model persisted, with Asian economies stepping in to finance the US deficits, while using the US market to grow rapidly. 
China is the latest and largest beneficiary of the economic model dubbed “Bretton Woods II.” 
Clearly, periods of global growth are almost always characterized by symbiotic imbalances. 
But, while each of these episodes was characterized by macroeconomic distortions caused by the imbalances, they lasted for years, or even decades. So, the real question is what the next generation of symbiotic imbalances will look like. 
It is likely that China will soon return to running very large current-account surpluses – potentially large enough to fund the US, with plenty left over for the rest of the world. 
As this capital cascades through the global financial system, it will re-inflate the economy. 
In the “Bretton Woods III” system, China will transform from “factory to the world” to “investor to the world.” 
Like all imbalanced systems, it will have its distortions, but the arrangement could last for many years. 
The Return of Industrial Policy 
CAMBRIDGE – British Prime Minister Gordon Brown promotes it as a vehicle for creating high-skill jobs. 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy talks about using it to keep industrial jobs in France. 
The World Bank’s chief economist, Justin Lin, openly supports it to speed up structural change in developing nations. 
McKinsey is advising governments on how to do it right. 
Industrial policy is back. 
In fact, industrial policy never went out of fashion. 
Economists enamored of the neo-liberal Washington Consensus may have written it off, but successful economies have always relied on government policies that promote growth by accelerating structural transformation. 
China is a case in point. 
Its phenomenal manufacturing prowess rests in large part on public assistance to new industries. 
State-owned enterprises have acted as incubators for technical skills and managerial talent. 
Local-content requirements have spawned productive supplier industries in automotive and electronics products. 
Generous export incentives have helped firms break into competitive global markets. 
Chile, which is often portrayed as a free-market paradise, is another example. 
The government has played a crucial role in developing every significant new export that the country produces. 
Chilean grapes broke into world markets thanks to publicly financed R&D. Forest products were heavily subsidized by none other than General Augusto Pinochet. 
And the highly successful salmon industry is the creation of Fundación Chile, a quasi-public venture fund. 
But when it comes to industrial policy, it is the United States that takes the cake. 
This is ironic, because the term “industrial policy” is anathema in American political discourse. 
It is used almost exclusively to browbeat political opponents with accusations of Stalinist economic designs. 
Yet the US owes much of its innovative prowess to government support. 
As Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner explains in his book Boulevard of Broken Dreams, US Department of Defense contracts played a crucial role in accelerating the early growth of Silicon Valley. 
The Internet, possibly the most significant innovation of our time, grew out of a Defense Department project initiated in 1969. 
Nor is America’s embrace of industrial policy a matter of historical interest only. 
Today the US federal government is the world’s biggest venture capitalist by far. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, the US Department of Energy (DOE) alone is planning to spend more than $40 billion in loans and grants to encourage private firms to develop green technologies, such as electric cars, new batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels. 
During the first three quarters on 2009, private venture capital firms invested less than $3 billion combined in this sector. 
The DOE invested $13 billion. 
The shift toward embracing industrial policy is therefore a welcome acknowledgement of what sensible analysts of economic growth have always known: developing new industries often requires a nudge from government. 
The nudge can take the form of subsidies, loans, infrastructure, and other kinds of support. 
But scratch the surface of any new successful industry anywhere, and more likely than not you will find government assistance lurking beneath. 
The real question about industrial policy is not whether it should be practiced, but how. 
Here are three important principles to keep in mind. 
First, industrial policy is a state of mind rather than a list of specific policies. 
Its successful practitioners understand that it is more important to create a climate of collaboration between government and the private sector than to provide financial incentives. 
Through deliberation councils, supplier development forums, investment advisory councils, sectoral round-tables, or private-public venture funds, collaboration aims to elicit information about investment opportunities and bottlenecks. 
This requires a government that is “embedded” in the private sector, but not in bed with it. 
Second, industrial policy needs to rely on both carrots and sticks. 
Given its risks and the gap between its social and private benefits, innovation requires rents – returns above what competitive markets provide. 
That is why all countries have a patent system. 
But open-ended incentives have their own costs: they can raise consumer prices and bottle up resources in unproductive activities. 
That is why patents expire. 
The same principle needs to apply to all government efforts to spawn new industries. 
Government incentives need to be temporary and based on performance. 
Third, industrial policy’s practitioners need to bear in mind that it aims to serve society at large, not the bureaucrats who administer it or the businesses that receive the incentives. 
To guard against abuse and capture, industrial policy needs be carried out in a transparent and accountable manner, and its processes must be open to new entrants as well as incumbents. 
The standard rap against industrial policy is that governments cannot pick winners. 
Of course they can’t, but that is largely irrelevant. 
What determines success in industrial policy is not the ability to pick winners, but the capacity to let the losers go – a much less demanding requirement. 
Uncertainty ensures that even optimal policies will lead to mistakes. 
The trick is for governments to recognize those mistakes and withdraw support before they become too costly. Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, once said, “If you want to succeed, raise your error rate.” 
The New Mercantilist Challenge 
CAMBRIDGE – The history of economics is largely a struggle between two opposing schools of thought, “liberalism” and “mercantilism.” 
Economic liberalism, with its emphasis on private entrepreneurship and free markets, is today’s dominant doctrine. 
But its intellectual victory has blinded us to the great appeal – and frequent success – of mercantilist practices. 
In fact, mercantilism remains alive and well, and its continuing conflict with liberalism is likely to be a major force shaping the future of the global economy. 
Today, mercantilism is typically dismissed as an archaic and blatantly erroneous set of ideas about economic policy. 
And, in their heyday, mercantilists certainly did defend some very odd notions, chief among which was the view that national policy ought to be guided by the accumulation of precious metals – gold and silver. 
Adam Smith’s 1776 treatise The Wealth of Nations masterfully demolished many of these ideas. 
Smith showed, in particular, that money should not be confused for wealth. As he put it, “the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but in its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all different kinds.” 
But it is more accurate to think of mercantilism as a different way to organize the relationship between the state and the economy – a vision that holds no less relevance today than it did in the eighteenth century. 
Mercantilist theorists such as Thomas Mun were in fact strong proponents of capitalism; they just propounded a different model than liberalism. 
The liberal model views the state as necessarily predatory and the private sector as inherently rent-seeking. 
So it advocates a strict separation between the state and private business. 
Mercantilism, by contrast, offers a corporatist vision in which the state and private business are allies and cooperate in pursuit of common objectives, such as domestic economic growth or national power. 
The mercantilist model can be derided as state capitalism or cronyism. 
But when it works, as it has so often in Asia, the model’s “government-business collaboration” or “pro-business state” quickly garners heavy praise. 
Lagging economies have not failed to notice that mercantilism can be their friend. 
Even in Britain, classical liberalism arrived only in the mid-nineteenth century – that is, after the country had become the world’s dominant industrial power. 
A second difference between the two models lies in whether consumer or producer interests are privileged. 
For liberals, consumers are king. 
The ultimate objective of economic policy is to increase households’ consumption potential, which requires giving them unhindered access to the cheapest-possible goods and services. 
Mercantilists, by contrast, emphasize the productive side of the economy. 
For them, a sound economy requires a sound production structure. And consumption needs to be underpinned by high employment at adequate wages. 
These different models have predictable implications for international economic policies. 
The logic of the liberal approach is that the economic benefits of trade arise from imports: the cheaper the imports, the better, even if the result is a trade deficit. 
Mercantilists, however, view trade as a means of supporting domestic production and employment, and prefer to spur exports rather than imports. 
Today’s China is the leading bearer of the mercantilist torch, though Chinese leaders would never admit it – too much opprobrium still attaches to the term. 
Much of China’s economic miracle is the product of an activist government that has supported, stimulated, and openly subsidized industrial producers – both domestic and foreign. 
Although China phased out many of its explicit export subsidies as a condition of membership in the World Trade Organization (which it joined in 2001), mercantilism’s support system remains largely in place. 
In particular, the government has managed the exchange rate to maintain manufacturers’ profitability, resulting in a sizable trade surplus (which has come down recently, but largely as a result of an economic slowdown). 
Moreover, export-oriented firms continue to benefit from a range of tax incentives. 
From the liberal perspective, these export subsidies impoverish Chinese consumers while benefiting consumers in the rest of the world. 
A recent study by the economists Fabrice Defever and Alejandro Riaño of the University of Nottingham puts the “losses” to China at around 3% of Chinese income, and gains to the rest of the world at around 1% of global income. 
From the mercantilist perspective, however, these are simply the costs of building a modern economy and setting the stage for long-term prosperity. 
As the example of export subsidies shows, the two models can co-exist happily in the world economy. 
Liberals should be happy to have their consumption subsidized by mercantilists. 
Indeed, that, in a nutshell, is the story of the last six decades: a succession of Asian countries managed to grow by leaps and bounds by applying different variants of mercantilism. 
Governments in rich countries for the most part looked the other way while Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China protected their home markets, appropriated “intellectual property,” subsidized their producers, and managed their currencies. 
We have now reached the end of this happy coexistence. 
The liberal model has become severely tarnished, owing to the rise in inequality and the plight of the middle class in the West, together with the financial crisis that deregulation spawned. 
Medium-term growth prospects for the American and European economies range from moderate to bleak. 
Unemployment will remain a major headache and preoccupation for policymakers. 
So mercantilist pressures will likely intensify in the advanced countries. 
As a result, the new economic environment will produce more tension than accommodation between countries pursuing liberal and mercantilist paths. 
It may also reignite long-dormant debates about the type of capitalism that produces the greatest prosperity. 
The Return of Post-Communism 
The collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe 15 years ago brought vast and positive democratic changes. 
But in 2006, after more than a decade of striving for acceptance by the West, the moral and political vacuum left by communism was fully exposed. 
Can a new balance between the democratic ethos and the undertows of the region’s political history and culture be found? 
In Poland, for example, the prevailing mix of Catholicism and nationalism made society particularly resistant to communism (certainly in comparison with the egalitarian, social-democratic ethos of pre-war Czechoslovakia). 
But these anti-communist antibodies also worked against the universal acceptance among Poles of liberal democracy. 
Indeed, right-wing populists in Poland and left-wing populists in Slovakia are now allied in government with extreme nationalist parties. 
In Hungary, the main opposition party Fidesz organizes demonstrations in front of Parliament for the resignation of a government, even after it won a confidence vote. 
In the Czech Republic, a minority right-wing government has not gained a confidence vote in Parliament after six months of bickering. 
Bulgaria’s entry into the European Union was heralded by a presidential race between an ex-communist (the victor, who claimed to like the EU) and a proto-fascist (who says he hates Turks, Gypsies, and Jews). 
Political instability and unpredictable behavior by elected leaders typifies affairs throughout the region. 
Even more worrying is the erosion of trust in democratic institutions. 
According to a recent Gallup International poll, Central and East Europeans are the most skeptical about democracy, which only about one-third of people trust. 
In contrast to a majority of West Europeans, East Europeans do not consider their elections free and fair. 
Only 22% responded affirmatively when asked, “Do you think your voice matters?” Democracy today has no rivals, but it is losing support. 
Populist movements harvest that ambivalence and discontent. 
They are not anti-democratic; indeed, they claim to be the “true voice of the people,” and constantly demand new elections or referenda. 
But they are anti-liberal; they accept democracy’s demand for the popular legitimacy, but reject its demand for constitutionalism (the separation of powers). 
They do not believe that constitutional norms and representative democracy have primacy over values and “legitimate” popular grievances. 
In Poland, the “politics of values” is based on the assumption that a “moral order” based on religion should prevail over the freedoms guaranteed by permissive liberalism on issues such as abortion, gay rights, and the death penalty. 
In Slovakia, the anti-liberal reaction applies also to the treatment of national minorities. 
Although there has so far been no significant shift in practice, the legitimation of xenophobia is a major feature of this onslaught on political liberalism: Jan Slota, the leader of the Slovak National Party, has said that he envies the Czechs for having expelled the Germans after WWII, and regularly accuses the Hungarian minority of “oppressing the majority nation.” 
Acute polarization is occurring everywhere, and it is here where the legacy of communist political culture is mostly keenly felt: an opponent is not someone with whom you argue or negotiate, but an enemy that you must destroy. 
After 15 years of free-market policies, populists in Warsaw, Bratislava, and Budapest want to bring back the state. 
And, since even socialist parties pushed liberal economic policies, it is not surprising that the far right, with its nationalist and protectionist overtones, has hijacked the social question. 
The populist challenge to the pro-market, pro-Western elite consensus that has prevailed in the region since 1990 takes two forms: an anti-corruption drive and “de-communization.” 
In Poland, the two are combined in a denunciation of the “original sin” of the 1989 compromise between moderate dissident elites and moderate communist elites, which enabled a non-violent exit from communism, but allegedly allowed the ex-communists to convert their political power into economic power. 
Hence the need for a two-pronged attack: anti-corruption and de-communization, which is also a leitmotiv of Fidesz in Hungary, and to some extent of the right-wing Civic Democratic Party now in power in Prague. 
Moreover, these populists attack the EU as an elite-imposed project, while pro-European coalitions have become exhausted, disintegrating in the aftermath of EU accession in 2004. 
Significantly, the Polish, Czech, and Hungarian prime ministers resigned within days or weeks after fulfilling the “historic” task of “returning to Europe.” 
Populist nationalists present themselves as the only defenders of national identity and sovereignty against “external threats,” as Polish Premier Jaroslaw Kaczynski put it. 
Their vision is a “Christian Europe” of “sovereign nation-states” that opposes the existing materialist, decadent, permissive, and supra-national model. 
The EU can probably learn to live with these populists, because it has to. 
Indeed, populism moves in cycles. 
Populists come to power promising “to clean house,” but once they move in and become identified with the house and all its flaws, they fall back on clientelism and state capture by the ruling parties (as we are now seeing in Poland) rather than becoming more radical. 
Many argue that the pro-EU consensus of the last decade emptied politics of its substance, contributing to the current populist backlash. 
But the EU can also constrain populism. 
After all, populist nationalists have joined (and since left) government coalitions in Austria, Italy, Holland, and Denmark. 
And, while nationalist populism is a trans-European phenomenon, populism today, unlike in the 1930’s, it does not hold itself out as an alternative to democracy. 
The Return of Religion? 
BUDAPEST – It’s a well-worn contrast: the United States is religious, Europe is secular. 
Yet, in some respects, this clichéd opposition has actually been reversed recently: religion played virtually no role during the last American presidential elections, while in a range of different European countries major controversies about religion have flared up, suggesting that questions of faith are back at the center of European politics. 
Consider French President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
On numerous occasions, he has argued that his country needs to rethink its traditional strict separation of state and religion, called laïcité . 
In particular, according to the twice-divorced self-confessed “cultural Catholic,” France should develop a “positive secularism.” 
In contrast to negative laïcité , which according to Sarkozy “excludes and denounces,” laïcité positive invites “dialogue” and recognizes the social benefits of religion. 
In a much criticized speech in Rome at the end of 2007, Sarkozy acknowledged the Christian roots of France, “the eldest daughter of the Church”; he also praised Islam during a visit to Saudi Arabia. 
Now he wants state subsidies for faith-based organizations – a policy proposal that upsets his many secularist critics. 
This new appeal to religion – after a long period when it was taken for granted that secularization would make religion less and less politically relevant – is not an exclusively French phenomenon. 
The Spanish People’s Party tried hard to mobilize Catholics during the election campaign in March 2008. 
The church supported the PP against a prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, whose advocacy of gay marriage, more relaxed divorce laws, and the removal of compulsory religion classes from the national curriculum upset many religious conservatives. 
Zapatero eventually felt it necessary to tell a Vatican envoy that Spanish bishops should stop meddling in the elections (which he won). 
In Italy, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi precipitated a constitutional crisis by trying to rush through emergency legislation to prevent a comatose patient from being taken off life support. 
This reminded many observers of what the America’s Republican Party tried to do in order to demonstrate its “pro-life commitments” during George W. Bush’s presidency. 
Finally, there is Britain, usually seen as perhaps the most secular country in Western Europe, and thus the least likely candidate to see the return of religion of any kind (outside its Muslim community). 
Under David Cameron’s leadership, the newly invigorated Conservative Party is listening to a number of thinkers, dubbed “red Tories,” who urge the party to turn its back on Thatcherism and embrace civil society, local community, the family, and, not least, religion as a major force in fostering responsible social behavior. 
In short, there is a pattern here. 
But the point is not that individuals in different European countries are becoming more religious – there is hardly any evidence for that. 
Globally, there might be good reasons to talk about what sociologists describe as the rise of “post-secular societies,” but Europe remains the exception. 
What really explains these new public controversies surrounding religion is something else, something political: the dilemma in which right-wing and center-right European parties find themselves. 
Many of these parties used to advocate market radicalism, or at least strong doses of economic liberalization. 
Not just since the financial crisis have they retreated from these positions and tried to fashion a gentler, more socially conscious image. 
Yet, in the search for what Cameron has called a new “look, feel, and identity,” these parties have been treading a fine line: on the one hand, they have attempted to appear more modern – for example, by appointing an increasing number of women and members of ethnic minorities to cabinet posts. 
On the other hand, they have painted themselves as sworn enemies of the left’s supposed moral relativism – an image for which the recourse to religion is obviously helpful. 
In fact, some intellectuals close to the right have long advocated an opening towards Europe’s Muslim immigrants and their descendants. 
Where they can vote, so the argument goes, Muslim traditionalists would rather vote for a conservative party, even if it has Catholic roots, than for a secular left-wing party perceived as advocating loose morals. 
This is not to say that all appeals to religion are just cynical election ploys. 
Especially in the face of the financial crisis, religion has been presented as a source for what Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have called the project of “moralizing capitalism.” 
That is not an absurd idea. 
There is a long and distinguished tradition of Catholic social thought. 
But taking these traditions seriously would require much larger transformations of capitalism than even avowed Christian Democrats are prepared to contemplate, including a much wider distribution of ownership and mechanisms for involving workers in management. 
Theories of “red Toryism” might go some way in this direction, but it remains to be seen whether they will ever translate into practice. 
For the moment, the temptation is for the European right to find its “new look” through a selective appeal to religion – and wait and see whether it works as an electoral strategy. 
The Return of the King in Nepal 
Every time we in Nepal think things can’t get worse, they do. 
In 2001, as our Maoist insurgency intensified and casualties soared, almost the entire royal family – including King Birendra – were massacred by one of Nepal’s princes. 
The next year, parliament was dissolved and local elected bodies were disbanded. 
As political parties bickered, King Gyanendra, who succeeded his murdered brother, sacked the prime minister in 2002 and ruled through an appointed cabinet. 
Last week, King Gyanendra sacked his prime minister again, declared a state of emergency, and suspended civil liberties. 
Nepal’s 15-year experiment with democracy now seems over. 
Since February 1, the Nepali media have been subjected to absolute censorship. 
Nothing that goes against the “letter and spirit” of the king’s dismissal of his government is allowed to be printed and broadcast, and “action will be taken against anyone violating the notice.” 
Armed soldiers now sit in newsrooms, vetting the galleys before they go off to press. 
Sometimes, they change headlines that they think are critical of the royal move. 
Nepal’s vibrant FM radio stations – once models for decentralized public-service broadcasting and community radio – have been prohibited from broadcasting current affairs. 
Some FM stations have been locked down and are silent. 
The BBC’s Nepalese service, which used to be relayed through a network of 12 FM stations all over the country, has been stopped. 
All Indian news channels have been dropped from cable networks. 
On Saturday, two senior journalists were detained for issuing statements critical of the crackdowns. 
Newspapers and magazines are blandly reproducing official pronouncements and reports from the state-run news agency. 
Some have taken the risk of resorting to metaphors and allegory, while others poke fun at the whole thing by writing editorials on ballet or bee-keeping. 
At least one newspaper came out with its news pages completely blank. 
Most young journalists, especially those in radio, have been shocked by the censorship. 
The freedoms that they were so accustomed to, and maybe even took for granted, have now been snatched away. 
But, for older journalists like me, there is a strong sense of déjà vu—the controls hark back to the times of the partyless absolute monarchy that existed here before 1990, when self-censorship was the order of the day. 
Back then, irrational news decisions, sycophancy, and propaganda were passed off as journalism. 
In those days, editors, reporters, and columnists played a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities, resorting to satire, humor, or metaphor. 
But punishment could be harsh. 
Many journalists spent time behind bars, and there was a price to be paid when the morning newspapers contained even accidental typos, such as occurred when a headline concerning a royal birthday read “suspicious” instead of “auspicious.” 
Old jokes from the pre-1990 days have returned, like this one: a man was walking down a Kathmandu street, shouting, “Down with dictatorship in Pakistan.” 
At the police station, he asked the protestor, “Why are you denouncing dictatorship in Pakistan when it exists here?” 
To be sure, many Nepalis have welcomed King Gyanendra’s move this week. 
Much of the public is disenchanted by the instability caused by fractious and corrupt parliamentary leaders and by the Maoist insurgency, which has cost 12,000 lives in nine years. 
If this is what the king had to do to restore peace, they say, so be it. 
After all, the king has staked all and gambled his own throne by taking over power. 
They have a point. 
Many expect the king to pull a rabbit out of his hat, to restore peace and start raising the living standards of Nepal’s 25 million people, most of whom live below the poverty line. 
In his speech on February 1, King Gyanendra said the Nepali people would have to temporarily give up democracy in order to save democracy, and many Nepalese will go along with that, at least for a while. 
The king has a window of opportunity to deliver on his promises. 
Perhaps King Gyanendra does have something up his sleeves. 
In the long run, however, the answer to Maoist totalitarianism is greater and more inclusive democracy, a vibrant free press, and civil liberties. 
Curtailing freedom merely polarizes society. 
Indeed, even as a short-term strategy against the Maoists, it may well prove counterproductive. 
The Return of the Radicals in Iran 
Twenty-six years after the Islamic Revolution, just when the West had expected Iran to settle down and become more pragmatic, the regime of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seems to have lurched back toward radicalism. 
By looking at earlier revolutions, we can perhaps come to understand what is happening in Iran, for recent events there have clear historical precedents. 
Many revolutions have passed through an initial “quiet” period after an early phase of radicalism, only to experience a resurgence of radicalism 15-25 years later. 
This is because the initial quiet period is often marked by corruption and a retreat from revolutionary goals, leading idealists to feel that the revolution is losing its way. 
Believing that stronger pursuit of revolutionary ideals is the only way to strengthen their country, these idealists seek to inspire a “return of the radicals,” triggering sharp conflict with their more pragmatic co-revolutionaries. 
The Mexican Revolution of 1910 began with a challenge to the dictator Porfirio Díaz that ignited peasant uprisings and worker revolts. 
The revolution’s radical phase seemed to end in 1920 when General Alvaro Obregón seized power; he limited land reforms and sought reconciliation with the United States. 
For the next 14 years, Obregón and his ally General Plutarco Calles ruled Mexico. 
Then, in 1934, resentment against growing corruption led Calles to choose an “honest idealist” to become president, a young man who had fought for him early in the revolution, who he thought he could control but who would help the government regain popularity. 
That “honest revolutionary,” Lázaro Cárdenas, toured the country, building his popular support, and then turned on Calles, expelling him from Mexico. 
Known for both his radicalism and his honesty, Cárdenas refused to live in the presidential palace and cut his salary in half. 
He also took seriously the early goals of the revolution, embarking on massive land reforms. 
In 1938 – twenty-eight years after the revolution began – Cárdenas provoked a major confrontation with the US and Britain by expropriating their oil companies and nationalizing Mexico’s petroleum. 
Only in the 1940’s, after Cárdenas left power, did Mexico turn to a more conservative political path. 
Similarly, China’s Communist Revolution began with a decade of attacks on the middle and professional classes and a reshaping of the countryside, culminating in the Great Leap Forward of 1958-59. 
But that disastrous campaign weakened Mao’s influence; by the early 1960’s he seemed to be relegated to the sidelines while pragmatists like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping grew stronger. 
Yet Mao worried that his revolution was going off track, and in the mid-1960’s he launched an effort to regain control of the Party by educating a new generation of radical youth. 
These “Red Guards” launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966-68, targeting the more conservative elements within the Communist Party. 
The Cultural Revolution tore China apart, but it returned Mao to supreme power and allowed him to purge the pragmatists. 
But did the battle between pragmatists and radicals end there? 
In the early 1970’s, moderates gained by engineering a rapprochement with the US, capped by Nixon’s famous visit to China in 1972. 
Deng was rehabilitated the following year, and in the late 1970’s, after Mao’s death, Deng’s pragmatists seized control of the regime. 
What do these historical examples suggest for Iran? 
It is likely that the relatively calm period dating from Khomeini’s death in 1989 is over. 
The election of Ahmadinejad marks the onset of new struggles within the ruling Islamic Republican Party. 
These pit the “honest radicals”- led by Ahmadinejad and supported by younger, second-generation revolutionaries known as the Abadgaran, or Developers, who are strong in the Iranian parliament, the Majlis- against the more corrupt and pragmatic mullahs who head the Party, led by Expediency Council Chairman and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is left in the middle, perhaps increasingly isolated and without strong popular support. 
How should the US and European leaders respond? 
Historically, phases of resurgent radicalism have lasted 5-10 years, marked by greater aggressiveness against internal and external enemies. 
This bodes ill for improved relations with Iran in the short run, and makes it imperative that Western powers unite to make it unambiguously clear that any use of nuclear weapons or materials by Iran or terror groups aligned with Iran will result in an immediate and devastating response. 
(China developed its nuclear weapons just before its Cultural Revolution, mainly to deter the Soviet Union, but never used them). 
It also seems advisable to offer positive incentives – including US recognition and an end to sanctions – that could help empower pragmatists in their intra-Party struggle, much as Nixon’s overtures to China helped blunt China’s radicalism and strengthened the hand of pragmatists in the Communist Party. 
Nixon did not demand that China’s leaders abandon communism or that Mexico become a competitive democracy, only that they act responsibly and learn to do business with the US. 
Five decades after its revolution, China is still not a democracy, and Mexico is only just becoming one nine decades after its revolution. 
Neither country always sees eye to eye with the West. 
But both became countries with which it is possible to do a great deal of business, and both are increasingly integrated into the global economy. 
That may be the only realistic goal in dealing with Iran. 
The Return of the Siloviki 
STOCKHOLM – Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recently announced that Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan have abandoned their separate talks to join the World Trade Organization. 
Instead, they would seek to enter the world trade body as a single customs union. 
In effect, this means that Russia seems to be casting aside its accession to the WTO – a major reversal of Russian strategy. 
Putin’s statement hit like a bolt from the blue. 
Two days earlier, United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk and European Union Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton had completed successful talks on Russia’s accession to the WTO with Putin’s first deputy, Igor Shuvalov, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, and Minister of Economy and Development Elvira Nabiullina. 
As late as June 3, Putin had declared himself sure of Russia’s “swift joining of the WTO.” 
The leaders of Belarus or Kazakhstan seemed equally surprised by Putin’s statement, especially as Russia had just prohibited almost all imports of dairy products from Belarus in a protectionist ploy. 
After 16 years of negotiations, Russia appeared poised to join the WTO within a couple of months. 
Indeed, only three difficult hurdles remained. 
First, Ukraine demands a bilateral protocol on market access, which would force Russia to abolish roughly 100 trade sanctions, primarily in agriculture. 
The second obstacle is border controls with Georgia, a mainly political issue: whether Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent, as Russia maintains, or are part Georgia, as the rest of the world believes. 
Finally, the EU insists that Russia abolish planned prohibitive export tariffs on lumber. 
Only the Georgian issue is really serious. 
A customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is no alternative to Russia’s WTO accession. 
No countries have ever entered the WTO collectively, nor is this legally possible says WTO head Pascal Lamy. 
Moreover, while the customs union was proclaimed in 1995, the earliest it can be formed is in July 2011, which is unlikely. 
Predominantly a commodity exporter, Russia has less need for the WTO than a manufacturer like China. 
Even so, one-fifth of Russia’s exports comprise metals and chemicals that are sensitive to anti-dumping measures. 
A series of World Bank and Russian studies have estimated that Russia can gain 0.5-1.0 percentage points in economic growth for half a decade if it joins the WTO. 
Membership is also important for Russia’s international standing. 
It is the only G-20 country outside of the WTO, which accounts for 96% of global trade. 
The WTO also represents a choice of economic and political strategy. 
Before Putin resigned as president in May 2008, he presented his “Russia 2020” program. Its heart was an “innovation strategy” based on more market reforms and investment in human capital, leading to annual growth of 6-7%. 
In their rhetoric, President Dmitri Medvedev and his technocrats embrace this vision. 
But Putin and his siloviki (political allies whose power base is in the security apparatus) seem to prefer an “inertia strategy,” the worst of the Russia 2020 scenarios. 
This strategy amounts to state capitalism, living on Russia’s energy wealth, and doing nothing to curtail Russia’s massive red tape and corruption. 
By reversing course on the WTO, Putin has again shown himself to be Russia’s master. 
He did the same thing last summer by lashing out against a successful mining and metallurgical company, Mechel, and provoking the war in Georgia. 
During the winter, Putin’s poor policy choices on the financial crisis undermined his power. 
Rather than shielding Russia’s private enterprises, he engineered a domestic liquidity freeze, which led to a sharp drop in GDP of 9.5% in the first quarter of 2009, despite Russia’s huge foreign reserves. 
The pragmatic technocrats took over, but the subsequent doubling of oil prices signals that the danger for Russia’s economy is over for now, so the siloviki are resuming command. 
The question is what their next step will be. 
The prominent Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer insists that their prime aim is to finish off Georgia and its president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who remains in power and defiant. 
Georgia has received no military support and is virtually undefended. 
The Kremlin continues its propaganda offensive against Georgia, and has vetoed prolonging the mandate for United Nations observers in Georgia and Abkhazia. 
A major Russian military maneuver, Caucasus 2009, is underway. 
The last such maneuver, Caucasus 2008, was followed by the invasion of Georgia. 
During the latter part of this maneuver, July 6-8, US President Barack Obama is supposed to meet President Medvedev in Moscow. 
Medvedev obviously hopes to reach out and improve Russia’s and his own standing in the world. 
The siloviki , however, prefer Russia isolated and authoritarian, with power securely in their hands. 
The Kremlin wants a new strategic arms control agreement, but the siloviki desire nothing more. 
Obama’s administration had hoped for a final breakthrough in Russia’s WTO talks, but Putin’s actions have eliminated prospects for such an outcome. 
The US also wants progress on the territorial integrity of former Soviet states, such as Georgia, but that, too, is unlikely. 
Putin or his collaborators seem to be setting up Medvedev for a failure, suggesting that their jealousy of Medvedev’s limited power is greater than their interest in defending Russia’s national interests. 
Yet there is still hope that Putin encounters a sufficiently negative reaction that he changes his stance on WTO accession. 
After all, he suspended Russia’s WTO accession talks after the August 2008 war in Georgia, only to allow them to restart this spring. 
The Return of Tuberculosis 
Generations of doctors, politicians, and public health officials have struggled to defeat tuberculosis. 
But, after years of success, TB is making a comeback. 
The increase in TB in the developed world since 1992 was initially attributed to HIV. 
However, over time, other factors behind the growing number of cases, such as immigration and a particular type of drug-resistant TB, have emerged. 
The World Health Organization has developed a strategy to fight TB’s return, including a standardized therapy that specifies appropriate drugs, doses, and timing of therapy. 
Unfortunately, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which is any TB resistant to the traditional treatments of isoniazid and rifampicin, represents a serious challenge: because standard treatment is less effective in curing it, its transmission continues. 
Moreover, any inadequately treated TB becomes multi-drug resistant, so that treatment failure can be either cause or consequence of MDR-TB. 
This underscores the need for a determined regimen to treat TB today, as well as a more complex strategy to control the disease, one which cures as many cases as possible, prevents acquired drug resistance and decreases the transmission of infection. 
The WHO recommends what it calls a “Directly Observed Therapy Strategy” (DOTS) and has set diagnostic thresholds of at least 70% of infectious cases, and curative thresholds of 85%. 
We conducted a systematic review of published reports to identify the factors that cause unsuccessful TB treatment in Europe. 
Twenty-six papers were included in the review, covering 13 countries (the former USSR, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania in Eastern Europe, and Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland in Western Europe) in the period from 1988-2001. 
On average, the studies found that 74.4% of the curative outcomes were “successful,” falling short of the WHO’s 85% target. 
Patients were treated “unsuccessfully” 12.3% of the time, and 6.8% of treated patients died. 
MDR-TB was inversely associated with successful treatments. 
We found that populations with at least 10% MDR-TB showed a notable reduction in successful outcomes. 
Surprisingly, no relationship was found between TB treatment outcomes and immigrant status in these studies, perhaps because all immigrants were combined, regardless of country of origin. 
These results suggest the following clinical and public health implications: 
· since successful TB treatment outcomes are below the 85% threshold, an enhancement of national TB control programs is needed in most European countries; 
· MDR is the most important obstacle to controlling TB in Europe; 
· analyzing immigrants by specific country of origin, timing of immigration, and previous treatment can help define the risk of MDR-TB associated with immigrants; 
· treatment characteristics need to be reported more consistently in order to identify and correct the factors related to inadequate treatment of TB in Europe. 
Although some characteristics of TB therapy, such as interruption of treatment, are well known predictors of multi-drug resistance, other aspects of treatment that reflect the health-care system, such as the drugs used and the length of therapy, must be studied to help improve control programmes. 
For example, one of the studies that we reviewed found that no standard therapy in the initial or secondary phase of treatment was associated with an unsuccessful outcome or death. 
Moreover, some aspects of patient management emerged as risk factors for not completing therapy, which suggests difficulties in access to health services for TB patients. 
Structural barriers do not represent the only problems of access to treatment in the health care system. 
Foreign-born patients may interrupt treatment due to lack of confidence in diagnosis and care, or they may ignore the more minor symptoms of the illness. 
Patients who feel better after the initial treatment may also fail to complete therapy. 
Social factors other than birthplace should be studied to evaluate what causes primary multi-drug resistance. 
Treatment interruption has been associated with asylum seekers and refugees in Switzerland. 
Interruption was also associated with homelessness, intravenous drug use, and alcohol dependence in Hamburg. 
In Spain, homelessness was a risk factor for interruption and HIV positivity, and intravenous drug use was a risk factor for unsuccessful treatment. 
I also believe that there is a relationship between the need for therapy and the political choices that countries make. 
The DOTS strategy is not implemented in all European countries, owing in part to disagreement about whether treatment is a duty or a right. 
Public health workers argue that therapy should be imposed upon patients who are at risk of failing to complete it – a policy that others claim would violate individual liberty. 
Unless we act to step up the fight against TB, many health-care systems may find themselves facing a less abstract problem: securing the economic resources and organizational capacity to ensure treatment for the growing number of patients who want and need it. 
The End of the Emerging-Market Party 
CAMBRIDGE – Enthusiasm for emerging markets has been evaporating this year, and not just because of the US Federal Reserve’s planned cuts in its large-scale asset purchases. 
Emerging-market stocks and bonds are down for the year and their economic growth is slowing. 
To see why, it is useful to understand how we got here. 
Between 2003 and 2011, GDP in current prices grew by a cumulative 35% in the United States, and by 32%, 36%, and 49% in Great Britain, Japan, and Germany, respectively, all measured in US dollars. 
In the same period, nominal GDP soared by 348% in Brazil, 346% in China, 331% in Russia, and 203% in India, also in US dollars. 
And it was not just these so-called BRIC countries that boomed. 
Kazakhstan’s output expanded by more than 500%, while Indonesia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Ukraine, Chile, Colombia, Romania, and Vietnam grew by more than 200% each. 
This means that average sales, measured in US dollars, by supermarkets, beverage companies, department stores, telecoms, computer shops, and Chinese motorcycle vendors grew at comparable rates in these countries. 
It makes sense for companies to move to where dollar sales are booming, and for asset managers to put money where GDP growth measured in dollars is fastest. 
One might be inclined to interpret this amazing emerging-market performance as a consequence of the growth in the amount of real stuff that these economies produced. 
But that would be mostly wrong. 
Consider Brazil. 
Only 11% of its China-beating nominal GDP growth between 2003 and 2011 was due to growth in real (inflation-adjusted) output. 
The other 89% resulted from 222% growth in dollar prices in that period, as local-currency prices rose faster than prices in the US and the exchange rate appreciated. 
Some of the prices that increased were those of commodities that Brazil exports. 
This was reflected in a 40% gain in the country’s terms of trade (the price of exports relative to imports), which meant that the same export volumes translated into more dollars. 
Russia went through a somewhat similar experience. 
Real output growth explains only 12.5% of the increase in the US dollar value of nominal GDP in 2003-2011, with the rest attributable to the rise in oil prices, which improved Russia’s terms of trade by 125%, and to a 56% real appreciation of the ruble against the dollar. 
By contrast, China’s real growth was three times that of Brazil and Russia, but its terms of trade actually deteriorated by 26%, because its manufactured exports became cheaper while its commodity imports became more expensive. 
The share of real growth in the main emerging countries’ nominal US dollar GDP growth was 20%. 
The three phenomena that boost nominal GDP – increases in real output, a rise in the relative price of exports, and real exchange-rate appreciation – do not operate independently of one another. 
Countries that grow faster tend to experience real exchange-rate appreciation, a phenomenon known as the Balassa-Samuelson effect. 
Countries whose terms of trade improve also tend to grow faster and undergo real exchange-rate appreciation as domestic spending of their increased export earnings expands the economy and makes dollars relatively more abundant (and thus cheaper). 
Real exchange rates may also appreciate because of increases in capital inflows, which reflect foreign investors’ enthusiasm for the prospects of the country in question. 
For example, from 2003 to 2011, Turkey’s inflows increased by almost 8% of GDP, which partly explains the 70% increase in prices measured in dollars. 
Real appreciation could also be caused by inconsistent macroeconomic policies that put the country in a perilous position, as in Argentina and Venezuela. 
Distinguishing between these disparate and inter-related phenomena is important, because some are clearly unsustainable. 
In general, terms-of-trade improvements and capital inflows do not continue permanently: they either stabilize or eventually reverse direction. 
Indeed, terms of trade do not have much of a long-term trend and show very pronounced reversion to the mean. 
While prices of oil, metals, and food rose very significantly after 2003, reaching historic highs sometime between 2008 and 2011, nobody expects similar price increases in the future. 
The debate is whether prices will remain more or less where they are or decline, as food, metals, and coal prices have already done. 
The same can be said of capital inflows and the upward pressure that they place on the real exchange rate. 
After all, foreign investors are putting their money in the country because they expect to be able to take even more money out in the future; when this occurs, growth tends to slow, if not collapse, as happened in Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland. 
In some countries, such as China, Thailand, South Korea, and Vietnam, nominal GDP growth was driven to a large extent by real growth. 
Moreover, according to the soon-to-be-published Atlas of Economic Complexity, these economies began producing more complex products, a harbinger of sustainable growth. 
Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria also had very significant real growth, but nominal GDP was boosted by very large terms-of-trade effects and real appreciation. 
For most emerging-market countries, however, nominal GDP growth in the 2003-2011 period was caused by terms-of-trade improvements, capital inflows, and real appreciation. 
These mean-reverting processes are, well, reverting, implying that the buoyant performance of the recent past is unlikely to return any time soon. 
In most countries, the US dollar value of GDP growth handsomely exceeded what would be expected from real growth and a reasonable allowance for the accompanying Balassa-Samuelson effect. 
The same dynamics that inflated the dollar value of GDP growth in the good years for these countries will now work in the opposite direction: stable or lower export prices will reduce real growth and cause their currencies to stop appreciating or even weaken in real terms. 
The Revolt of China’s Twittering Classes 
BEIJING – Last week, Liu Xiaobo was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China. 
That award comes at a crucial moment in Chinese politics, as it may well become a stepping stone on China’s long march toward greater freedom. 
Yet few voices in mainland Chinese media are discussing Liu’s Nobel Prize. 
The government’s propaganda department has ordered major media to keep the news from spreading to the general public by imposing strict censorship. 
In fact, on CCTV’s widely viewed 7 p.m. national newscast, not a word on Liu was mentioned on the day he received the prize. 
Despite this news blackout, China’s blogosphere and microblogs exploded after Liu was announced as the winner. 
For example, on Sina’s microblog site, bloggers used pictures, euphemisms, and English or traditional Chinese characters to avoid censorship. 
Twitter-style microblogging is extremely popular in China. 
Twitter.com was officially blocked last year, following the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown and the riots in Xinjiang that summer. 
Soon afterwards, its most famous Chinese clone, Fanfou.com, also was closed down, leaving one million registered users homeless. 
Nevertheless, although Twitter can be accessed in China only via proxy servers, it still plays a vital role in Chinese Internet life because of its ability to connect different news sources and social activists. 
Indeed, Twitter is the only place where people can talk freely about Liu‘s Nobel prize. 
A search of the hash tag “#Liuxiaobo” shows that relevant messages pop up hundreds of times per minute. 
More generally, Twitter has become a powerful tool for Chinese citizens as they increasingly play a role in reporting local news in their communities. 
But the social revolution brought by microblogging might be even more important than the communication revolution. 
Indeed, here Chinese Twitter users lead the world, using it for everything from social resistance, civic investigation, and monitoring public opinion, to creating black satire, “organizing without organizations” in the Guangdong anti-incineration movement, and mailing postcards to prisoners of conscience. 
Ever since Iranians used Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests against the stolen presidential election of June 2009, there has been much discussion about the role of digital activism in authoritarian countries like China. 
Does Web 2.0 technology imply an analogous role for “Twivolution” in a Chinese democratic transition one day? 
Twitter political activism in China challenges the simplistic yet widespread assumption that social media in the hands of activists can lead swiftly to mass mobilization and social change. 
Instead, these information-sharing tools and channels promote more subtle social progress. 
That subtlety reflects the distinction between macro-politics and micro-politics. 
Macro-politics is structural, whereas micro-politics is daily. 
Changes in the micro-political system do not necessarily lead to an adjustment in the macro structure, particularly in hyper-controlled political systems like China’s. 
But if small units are well organized, they can greatly improve the well-being of society as a whole, bit by bit, by working at the micro level. “Micro-information” and “micro-exchange” can push forward real change. 
Why is micro-power so important? 
In the past, only a few highly motivated people engaged in political activism; the masses took almost no initiative. 
Passionate people did not understand why the public seemed unconcerned about their efforts. 
Today, highly motivated people can lower the threshold for action so that people with less passion join their efforts. 
Currently, the Chinese Twittersphere has three prominent features: First, as China’s rulers strengthen their censorship efforts, Twitter has become highly politicized. 
Moreover, Twitters brings opinion leaders together around one virtual table, attracting a lot of “new public intellectuals” and “rights advocates,” as well as veterans of civil rights movements and exiled dissidents. 
Its influence on Chinese cyberspace and traditional media is the result of this grouping. 
Finally, Twitter can be used as a mobilizing tool in China. 
Recent years have seen an explosion of activities indicating that Twitter has become the coordinating platform for many campaigns asserting citizens’ rights. 
With the proliferation of Twitter clones in China (all the major portals now offer microblog services), social movements in China are getting a long-term boost. 
So Twitter has become a major tool to promote contentious politics in China. 
It can effectively link discourse and action, generate widespread campaigns, and forge common ground among rights activists, public intellectuals, and all kinds of Twitter users. 
In fact, a series of protests and events held since the second half of 2009 suggests a close relationship between Twitter and contentious real-life politics, and thus invites new possibilities for reshaping China’s authoritarian regime. 
The Revolt of the Debtors 
BRUSSELS – Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s call to hold a referendum on the rescue package agreed at the eurozone summit in late October has profound implications for European governance, despite the fact that the referendum will not now go ahead. 
It may also determine the future of the euro. 
Papandreou had to reverse course quickly in response to both internal and external pressure, but the option that he put on the table will not go away whatever the fate of the present Greek government. 
As long as the Greek people have to be asked to accept one austerity package after another, they might wonder when they will have a direct say on this matter. 
Less than one week before Papandreou dropped his bombshell, eurozone leaders had spoken unequivocally: “The introduction of the European Semester has fundamentally changed the way our fiscal and economic policies are coordinated at European level, with co-ordination at EU level now taking place before national decisions are taken.” 
Simply put, pan-eurozone financial governance had supposedly won the day. 
Technically, Papandreou’s proposed referendum was not directly about fiscal or economic policy, but it is a decision that would have had huge economic ramifications for the eurozone. 
Despite that, it was taken without any coordination with other eurozone leaders. 
Moreover, if Greece’s voters had rejected the deal that has just been proposed to them, the outcome might have foreclosed any further coordination on the country’s debt problems with the European Union. 
Greece would have sunk or swum on its own. 
So, only days after the eurozone’s heads of state and government congratulated themselves on their summit success, the concept of coordination was shown to be meaningless for the one country where coordination matters most. 
Papandreou’s move also exposes the fatal flaw of grand plans for a political or fiscal union to support the euro: the “people,” not governments, remain the real sovereign. 
Governments may sign treaties and make solemn commitments to subordinate their fiscal policy to the wishes of the EU as a whole (or to be more precise, to the wishes of Germany and the European Central Bank); but, in the end, the people may reject any adjustment program that “Brussels” (meaning Berlin and Frankfurt) might want to impose. 
The EU remains a collection of sovereign states, and it therefore cannot send an army or a police force to enforce its pacts or collect debt. 
Any country can leave the EU – and, of course, the eurozone – when the burden of its obligations becomes too onerous. 
Until now, it had been assumed that the cost of exit would be so high that no country would consider it. 
This no longer seems to be the case – or so the Greeks, at least, seemed to believe. 
This also implies that Eurobonds will never constitute the silver bullet that some had hoped would solve Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. 
As long as member states remain fully sovereign, investors cannot be assured that if the eurozone breaks up, some states will not simply refuse to pay – or will not refuse to pay for the others. 
With popular resistance to paying for profligate southern Europeans rising in Germany and Holland, governments there might be forced to ask their people whether they want to pay the huge costs implied by their commitments to bail out eurozone members that are unwilling or unable to pay. 
That is why the bonds issued by the eurozone’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, are trading at a substantial premium relative to German debt, while efforts by Klaus Regling, the EFSF’s head, to convince China, Japan, and other Asians to buy the bonds have gotten nowhere. 
The broader message of the Greek move is that “coordination” has so far been a code word for almost total control by creditors (sometimes together with the ECB). 
The attempt to impose a benevolent creditors’ dictatorship is now being met by a debtors’ revolt. 
Financial markets have reacted so strongly because investors now comprehend that “sovereign debt” is the debt of a sovereign that can simply decide not to pay. 
Holders of bonds of the eurozone’s member states have now been put on notice that, when the going gets tough, the real sovereign, “We, the people,” might be asked whether they actually want to pay. 
And the answer might very well be an emphatic “no,” as opinion polls in Greece and the experience of Iceland (whose population twice voted down deals agreed by the Icelandic government) suggest is likely. 
Nobody can know at this point whether Portugal or Italy might be the next stops on this road of resistance. 
The result, however, is quite predictable: soaring risk premia throughout the periphery. 
Papandreou’s decision to call a referendum in Greece could thus have marked the beginning of the endgame for the euro. 
At this point, the common currency can be saved only if systemically important countries – namely, Italy and Spain – take concerted action to demonstrate that they are different from Greece. 
The Revolt of the Meritocrats 
PARIS – The bailout of the financial system was a bizarre moment in economic history, for it benefited those who benefited most from the markets’ irrational exuberance – the bosses of financial firms. 
Before the crisis hit, however, redistribution of wealth (and the tax and social security payments that make it possible) was considered the biggest obstacle to economic efficiency. 
Indeed, the values of solidarity had given way to those of individual “merit,” judged by the size of one’s paycheck. 
The paradox is that a part of this evolution may be attributable to two positive factors: the slow work of democracy, which liberates individuals but at the same time leaves them more isolated; and the development of a welfare system that shares risks and makes individuals more autonomous. 
With this isolation and autonomy, people increasingly tend to believe, for better or for worse, that they alone are responsible for their own fate. 
Here lies the conundrum. 
An individual is free and autonomous only because of the collective decisions taken after democratic debate, notably those decisions that guarantee each person access to public goods such as education, health care, etc. 
Some sense of social solidarity may remain, but it is so abstract that those for whom the wheel of fortune has spun so favorably feel little debt. 
They believe that they owe their status purely to merit, not to the collective efforts – state-funded schools, universities, etc. – that enabled them to realize their potential. 
When merit is measured by money, there is no ethical limit to the size of an individual’s paycheck. 
If I earn ten, a hundred, or a thousand times more than you, it is because I deserve ten, a hundred, or a thousand times more than you. 
Merit and skills are how we give an intrinsic value to money. 
Human nature – ego and/or arrogance – does the rest. 
It is no surprise, then, that many people think of themselves as priceless. 
The central place where this self-(over)evaluation meets the fewest obstacles is the financial market. 
Money there is an abstraction – “the abstraction of abstractions,” as Hegel put it – which helps explain why salaries are no longer rooted in reality. 
Of course, when the crisis hit, financial institutions were the first to argue that autonomy was unrealistic, and that we are all interdependent. 
After all, why else should taxpayers agree to rescue them? 
But now these same institutions are deciding that they want to go their own way again. 
So yesterday’s (pre-crisis) world is being resurrected. 
Dismissing the risks that taxpayers incurred, financial institutions used the bailout to restore profitability and are now reverting to their old habits, which had worked so well for them and so badly for others. 
No one should be surprised about this. 
The economic stakes encourage everyone to make the best of their circumstances. 
The bailout of banks led to a wave of mergers. 
If they were already too big to fail, what should we now say when banks are even bigger? 
Their market power has increased, yet they know they incur no risk, owing to the aggravated systemic impact of their potential bankruptcy. 
Moreover, they face an economy starved of credit, in which the crisis endangered many companies whose bankruptcy would have no systemic effect. 
Working in so uncompetitive a market is a real stroke of luck. 
I do not know many businessmen who would not take advantage of this; to be honest, I do not know any. 
The free-market doctrine, which has become almost a religion, reinforced this belief: markets are efficient, and if they pay me so much (a potentially mind-boggling amount, as seen in recent cases), it is because my own efficiency warrants it. 
I also participate indirectly and abstractly in forging the common good, by creating value through my work, and I am rewarded for it. 
But suddenly the system collapses, the creation of value turns into destruction and parallel universes collide. 
No mathematician can remember so unprecedented and spectacular a result: parallel lines intersecting, with autonomy becoming (for the brief moment of the bailout at least) interdependence. 
For the connections between the economy and the world of finance are so strong and the interdependency between the so-called parallel universes so tight that there was no choice. 
Eyes are opened; the illusion of arbitrage between efficiency and solidarity fades. 
The crisis reminds us what each person owes to others, highlighting an ethical truth that we were quick to forget: the rich benefit more than the poor from their cooperation with other members of society. 
Two conclusions can be drawn from all this. 
The first is that we all owe at least some of our success to others, given the public goods that society provides. 
This calls for more modesty and restraint in determining the highest salaries, not for moral reasons but for the sustainability of the system. 
The second conclusion is that the most privileged classes, which have benefited the most from the solidarity of others, notably the poor, can no longer deny the latter’s contributions. 
But don’t hold your breath waiting for them to agree. 
The Revolt of the Mullahs 
Iran's election fiasco seemingly confirmed for Iranian reformists a conclusion that tens of millions of Iranian citizens reached long ago - the country's Islamic government, as it exists today, is beyond rehabilitation. 
Whether ordinary Iranians now believe that the reformers are also beyond redemption is an open question. 
Iranian reformers had tried (to no avail) since the landslide 1997 election of President Mohammed Khatami, to change the system from within. 
Iranians were initially hopeful, but after years of waiting in vain they grew impatient. 
Now they are despondent. 
Reformists were justly criticized for lacking unity and resolve, but in truth their greatest impediment was a lack of constitutional authority. 
Power in Iran lies in the hands of the unelected conservative establishment, namely Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the twelve-member Islamic Guardian Council. 
They have no intention of parting with it. 
The Guardian Council's barring of over 2,000 mostly reformist candidates from participating in the parliamentary elections was the last straw. 
Reformist parties boycotted the vote. 
Despite a frenzied public relations campaign by regime officials, only half of all eligible voters participated. 
In Tehran, the country's political heart and soul, less than a third of the electorate turned out. 
Foreign journalists declared it the biggest legitimacy crisis in the 25-year history of the Islamic Republic, but Iranians seemed surprised by the commotion. 
Egregious abuse of power by conservative hardliners is not newsworthy to them. 
They held no illusions that their country was a democracy. 
Iran's near-term political future remains unclear. 
How reformists regroup, and how the youthful Iranian populace reacts, depends largely on the path the conservatives take. 
Similar to reformists, who encompass a broad range of political ideals, Iranian conservatives are a mixed bag. Many are reactionary religious fundamentalists who abhor the concept of democracy. 
"It doesn't matter what people think," the powerful cleric Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi once said. "The people are ignorant sheep." 
However, a small but increasing number of conservative thinkers - while not democrats - advocate a more pragmatic and conciliatory approach, essentially adopting the language that once worked so well for the now-beleaguered reformists. 
"It's better for all of us that mainstream conservatives go to parliament, people who are not extremist but pragmatic and moderate," according to the influential newspaper editor Amir Mohebian, who is emerging as the face of Iranian "compassionate conservatism." 
Whether conservative ideologues or pragmatists dominate the new parliament - which takes office in June - remains to be seen. 
Either way, the conservatives must weigh their strategy carefully. 
A more ideological and antagonistic approach - in the form of increased political and social repression - could stir Iran's discontented masses, reviving the non-violent but radicalized reformists. 
Some of these now call for passive resistance and civil disobedience. 
It will be the task of Ayatollah Khamenei to rein in conservative ideologues and make sure that pragmatic conservatism prevails. 
That Khamenei is himself more of an ideologue makes that task doubly difficult for him. 
Although he is capable of providing people with increased political and social freedoms, he is simply unwilling. 
Above all, the conservatives' fate - and the fate of the regime as a whole - depends on the country's punishing economy. 
Despite Iran's vast oil wealth, close to a third of the population lives in poverty. 
Inflation and unemployment remain rampant. 
Demographics exacerbate these conditions. 
Two-thirds of Iran's 69 million people are under 30 years old, and officials admit they have no way of accommodating the burgeoning labor force. 
For the majority of Iranians, economic improvement is the priority. 
As a 57-year old retired Iranian professional moonlighting as a taxi driver told me, "When your stomach is empty you don't cry for democracy, you cry for bread!" 
Conservatives, no less than reformers, must come to terms with this reality. 
No matter how hard they try, there exists no simple or immediate solution to Iran's endemic economic corruption and mismanagement. 
As a result, Iran's near-term political prospects appear ominous. 
But reasons to be hopeful about the long-term political future do exist. 
An indigenous civil society has emerged; indeed, Iran appears to be the only nation in the Islamic Middle East that is building a sustainable liberal foundation from the bottom up. 
Monarchic and theocratic systems have both failed. 
Backers of a socialist model have gone the way of the Soviet Union. 
Liberal democracy is essentially the last man standing in Iran. 
The road from authoritarianism to democracy will not be smooth or short. 
Agitators for reform will continue to push. 
Regime loyalists will continue to push back. 
In the absence of a credible and readily available political alternative, deadlock will likely continue, with the pace of change slower than the population demands. 
So the long term could be long in coming. 
Courageous Iranians who have labored to reform their country may continue to feel as though they are plowing the seas. 
The Revolt Of The States 
BUENOS AIRES: Ceaseless change seems to be at the heart of today’s global civilization. 
Because of this, countries that consider their domestic realities as sacrosanct find themselves unable to assimilate change or foresee its direction. 
To them, change appears as something irrational, even as a catastrophe. 
As we saw in the anti-IMF protests in Prague recently, and last year’s street protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, such fears are spreading far and wide. 
People increasingly see change not as something that enhances their freedom and dignity but as a force encouraging avarice and unfairness. 
By concentrating wealth narrowly, globalization produces more threats than opportunities. 
The difficulty in transferring knowledge and new technologies from the center to the periphery, for example, widens economic disparity and subjugates some countries to a new form of colonialism. 
Seeing this, many people fear a new dominant class intolerably manipulating globalization for its betterment. 
By limiting prospects for growth for many people, today’s international economic order is inconsistent with the ideals of the great democratic revolution of our century, which says that no inhabitant of the world should be left behind. 
For those peoples and countries now marginalized from the process of technological development, production, and exchange I believe that only one viable option exists: a new assertion of themselves as independent states, regionally integrated in as many ways as possible. 
Only with independence does the confidence for greater participation come, and greater participation means improved governance, both in the international order and domestically. 
Ungovernablity arises from attempts to maintain control over people and places who are marginalized from participating in decisions that determine their daily lives. 
Citizens and countries alike become “ungovernable” when they see themselves as passive instruments of decisions taken by a closed elite that rules by transforming them into a mute “mass”. 
For free individuals – free citizens, free states – are the real protagonists of governance. 
Without full and equal responsibility there can be no lasting governance. 
This is what market fundamentalists, management consultants, and technocrats fail to understand. 
Countries, citizens, users, consumers, producers, workers, entrepreneurs, professionals cannot be left out of the decisions that hold significant consequences for their lives and goals, indeed for the very values of society. 
People in the United States and Western Europe recognize how continuity in their democratic systems enhanced their prosperity. 
By contrast, we in Latin America and Eastern Europe know that democracy has trouble surviving in times of crisis, poverty, and isolation. 
Preserving democratic values is hard when large sectors cannot integrate with the global market, when misery obliterates human dignity and a lack of options makes freedom meaningless. 
It is a bitter paradox, indeed, that the developed democracies use the power of globalization to punish us commercially by discriminating against our citizens and exports. 
In individual states protection of the weak is attained by equal application of the rule of law. 
This must also be made true in international relations. 
But to create an international order based on law and not force – economic force having replaced military might – it is necessary to strengthen and spread multilateralism into political fields as well in economic ones. 
Only the cooperation of free and equal nations can bring this about. 
Related to this is the fact that nowadays economic development depends less on a particular country and more on regional integration, which can serve to avoid the negative effects of those financial speculations boosted by globalization. 
So the world needs, in its regions, to facilitate integration on the basis of a general economic democratization: currency compatibility, free trade, shared legal rules and most of all a common will to fix the rules of the game according to a region’s entire interests. 
Only such equal cooperation can secure the solid political basis for integration. 
So long as a country is subordinated to the uncontrollable force of globalization, its future is in foreign hands. 
But in agreeing to open regional economies to imports, poor and developing countries must be allowed some means to protect their new industries. 
There is justice in this, particularly given the hypocrisy of those countries who proclaim their faith in free trade while every day praying at the altar of protectionism. 
Everyone acknowledges that the market requires rules in order to avoid deformations such as monopolies and oligopolies. 
But monopolies of wealth are just as pernicious. 
The State should not abandon its redistributive role; neither can the State surrender to the market its role in development. 
Indeed, quality housing and schooling, pensions and unemployment insurance, a modern health system and family social services must not be the fruits of an established democracy but a condition for democracy’s consolidation and survival. 
For any program based on selfishness and injustice must generate strong forces of social dissolution and instability. 
The great challenge is to increase equality, and for this the State, which globalization claims to have overthrown, is vital. 
Only it can establish progressive taxes, adequate regulation of privatized public services, support to small and medium size companies, more efficiency in the public spending and a significant improvement in the education and health systems. 
It is the State’s undeniable obligation to guarantee the benefits of social security to all the inhabitants of a country. 
Marxists used to agitate that the workers of the world unite. 
They never did, but we are now seeing a globalization of solidarity, of support for cooperative regional patterns and the need to rethink international agencies, and the impracticality of isolation. 
Without such solidarity, we are marching towards a world with no center, no authority, no order; a world ruled by a globalized Mafia “where what is official and what is clandestine will meet”. 
The logic of power in that future world will be unforgiving toward those who give up on their will to self-determination. 
To maintain that will, we must fight the fear of going against the prevailing political orthodoxy of an inevitable globalization. 
The only fish that always swims with the current is a dead fish. 
The Revolution Betrayed 
KYIV – From snowy Kyiv, I have watched the successful revolutions in Cairo and Tunis with joy and admiration. 
Egyptians and Tunisians are right to be proud of their desire to peacefully overthrow despotic governments. 
But, as someone who led a peaceful revolution, I hope that pride is tempered by pragmatism, because a change of regime is only the first step in establishing a democracy backed by the rule of law. 
Indeed, as my country, Ukraine, is now demonstrating, after revolutionary euphoria fades and normality returns, democratic revolutions can be betrayed and reversed. 
The first of Ukraine’s lessons for Egyptian and Tunisian democrats is that elections do not a democracy make. 
After all, what if the enemies of freedom use elections to entrench their anti-democratic agendas? 
What if elements of the old regime, or the cadres of militant minorities, only pretend to embrace democratic norms in order to hijack the new democracy? 
In Ukraine today, these are not abstract questions. 
Six years after our Orange Revolution, not only is my country’s democracy under threat, but the rule of law is being systematically perverted and our national independence bartered away. 
Indeed, the hybrid presidential/parliamentary system that Ukraine established as part of the settlement which brought a peaceful end to our revolution is being hollowed out in order to concentrate all political power in the hands of a supposedly democratically elected president. 
Of course, Ukraine’s plight does not mean that the people of Egypt and Tunisia should spurn the call for free elections. 
Determining the will of the people does require expression through the ballot box. 
But elections alone cannot solve the fundamental political problems confronting Egypt and Tunisia. 
In particular, they cannot create a liberal order and open society. 
To be effective, elections must be preceded by an extensive debate, in which political arguments are made, attacked, defended, and, ultimately, embodied in ideologically coherent party organizations. 
Democratic consent can truly be given only when voters know what they are consenting to. 
Whoever refuses to make a public case for what he or she intends to do when in power, or lies about it – as Ukraine’s current president, Viktor Yanukovych, did during his campaign against me last year – is no supporter of the democracy that citizens risked their lives to establish. 
Moreover, democracy must be rooted in the rule of law. 
There must be accepted rules that are binding on everyone in politics, so that whoever does not accept or obey them is disqualified. 
Yanukovych’s naked attempt to hijack the election that precipitated the Orange Revolution should have caused him to be banned from running in future elections. 
Yet he was not. 
Now, as president, Yanukovych’s crude instinct is to treat the law and constitution as Karl Marx thought of them: as a mixture of sentimentality, superstition, and the unconscious rationalization of private interests. 
Stealing elections, suppressing the vote, and behaving in contempt of the rule of law are negations of democracy. 
Those who engage in them must be seen as democracy’s enemies and treated as such. 
A second lesson follows from this. 
The fact that a government has been democratically elected does not mean that the cause of freedom has prevailed. 
The rest of the world must not turn a blind eye to authoritarian backsliding. 
Yet today, not only are many of Ukraine’s neighbors silent about Yanukovych’s strangulation of Ukraine’s democracy, but some openly celebrate the supposed “stability” that his regime has imposed. 
For decades, Egyptians and Tunisians paid a high a price in freedom for the stability of others. 
They must never be asked, or forced, to pay it again. 
One way to help prevent a democratic revolution from being betrayed from within is by building a genuine civil society. 
We in Ukraine learned this truth from harsh experience in the communist era. 
Although communism could, every now and then, coexist with private property, and sometimes with private enterprise, it could never coexist with civil society. 
The most fateful attack to accompany the installation of any dictatorship is an attack on civil society. 
In Ukraine, freedom of speech was, on communism’s fall, restored overnight. 
But reviving civil society – the many mutually complementary ways in which citizens participate in public life – is a complicated task, as the peoples of Egypt and Tunisia will soon find out. 
The reason is self-evident: civil society is an intricate, fragile, even mysterious entity that evolves over decades, if not centuries. 
Its pillars – private, voluntary associations, decentralization of the state, and delegation of political power to independent bodies – must be nurtured patiently and from below. 
Where civil society remains underdeveloped, every problem filters up to the “Big Man” squatting at the top. 
So the more power is concentrated at the center, the more it becomes possible for anti-democratic forces to gain – or regain – control over a country. 
As people around the world encourage the prospect of democracy coming to Egypt and Tunisia, let us not be beguiled by its formal trappings. 
Let us celebrate the arrival in North Africa of the spirit of liberty and of solidarity, which brought Ukraine its liberty once and will do so again. 
And let us pledge that our solidarity does not end at the borders of our nations. 
Freedom – true freedom – is indivisible. 
The Revolution Reborn 
MEXICO CITY – In El Salvador, for the first time ever in Latin America, a former political-military organization that tried to gain power through the barrel of a gun has achieved its aims through the ballot box. 
Although the Sandinista Front in Nicaragua did win a semi-legitimate election in 1984, it had reached power five years earlier by overthrowing the Somoza dictatorship. 
By 2006, when Daniel Ortega was finally re-elected, the old Sandinista Front of 1979 was unrecognizable. 
El Salvador’s Farabundo Martí Liberation Front (FMLN) was created in 1980, through the fusion of five guerrilla groups supported by Cuba and Nicaragua. 
The FMLN nominated a presentable and attractive candidate, Mauricio Funes, for last Sunday’s presidential election, and, despite seeing a 10-point lead whittled down to barely two points by election night, squeaked out an uncontested victory. 
The conservative ARENA party, which has governed El Salvador since the country’s 10-year civil war ended in 1992, did everything possible to prevent an FMLN victory, resorted, once again, to every red-baiting trick in the book. 
According to ARENA’s relentlessly negative campaign, a triumph for the left would bring communism, Hugo Chávez, and the Castro brothers to San Salvador. 
But scare tactics did not work this time. 
There is obviously a lesson here to be learned by other left-wing political movements and guerrilla groups in Latin America. 
The Socialist Party in Chile, the Workers Party in Brazil, the Broad Front in Uruguay, even Chávez in Venezuela and the PRD and FSLN in Mexico and Nicaragua, respectively, have shown that, after years of waiting, the left can win elections in Latin America. 
The difference between these victorious leftists and El Salvador’s FMLN will be revealed when the FMLN’s old characteristics as an armed movement are challenged by the daily facts of governance. 
For, while Funes is no old guerrilla hack, his vice president, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, and almost the entire FMLN leadership are unreformed Castroist guerrilla leaders and cadres. 
It is they, not Funes, who control the FMLN organization. 
The FMLN’s most reform-minded, democratic, modern, and brilliant leaders – Facundo Guardado, Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador Samayoa, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, and Ferman Cienfuegos – have all left the party. 
A second worrying factor is the FMLN’s links to Cuba and Venezuela. 
As recently as a year ago, anyone who visited FMLN headquarters in San Salvador to interview, for example, Ceren, its Secretary General, would be struck by the overwhelming presence of Chávez: red shirts, red berets, pictures of the Venezuelan caudillo, quotations from his teachings and musings. 
Chávez helped the FMLN by giving free or cheap oil to its mayors in many parts of the country, and probably (though it has not been proven) by channeling funds, if only in small quantities, to the party’s electoral coffers. 
The Cuban presence also remains strong, although the recent political purges initiated by Raúl Castro make it difficult to know who exactly is working for whom. 
Ramiro Abreu, who “ran” El Salvador for Cuba’s Department of the Americas in the 1980’s and 1990’s, remains active, but now more as a businessman and a senior statesman than as a Cuban operative. 
But Cuba’s influence on the old FMLN leadership remains intact. 
Cuban and Venezuelan involvement in political parties in Mexico or Brazil, for example, is undisputable, but not necessarily very relevant. 
These are large countries with huge economies, where conspiring and doling out small perks and favors is not very effective. 
But El Salvador, like Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Ecuador, is another story. 
A third factor that weighs in the balance in analyzing what sort of government the FMLN may deliver is the economic crisis that is battering Latin America. 
For the moment, it is impossible to ascertain whether the recession will provoke a radicalization of the left in the region, which Chávez seems to be promoting, or induce moderation through resignation – that is, a postponement of revolutionary goals owing to inauspicious economic conditions. 
We will know soon. 
But the most important consequence of the FMLN’s victory may lie in its effect on the rest of Central America and Mexico. 
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, more out of convenience and demagogy than conviction, has moved into the Chávez orbit; 
Nicaragua’s Ortega was always part of that orbit, as are people close to Alvaro Colóm in Guatemala. 
If too we add El Salvador to this list, only Costa Rica and Panama to the south remain out of the loop, leaving Mexico to the north increasingly exposed. 
Of course, the Central American nations do not wield huge influence in Mexico; if anything, it is the other way around. 
But the Mexican left, while no longer as weak as it was after its defeat in 2006, has always needed foreign role models. 
It sympathizes far more with Chávez, Bolivian President Evo Morales, Cuba, the Sandinistas, and now the FMLN than with the moderate left elected in Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, and Peru. 
They will read Funes’ victory as one more notch on the barrel of “the people’s” rifle and one more hair plucked from Uncle Sam’s beard. 
To dismiss the FMLN’s historical achievement as simply an act of justice or a foreseeable event in a tiny backwater would be reckless. 
The Revolution Will Not Be Memorialized 
Forty years ago Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution. 
The Propaganda Department of China’s ruling Communists have now issued an order banning any kind of reviews or commemoration of this disaster as part of the Party’s bid to make the Chinese forget about that lost decade. 
But in condemning the Japanese for neglect of the Nanjing massacre during the Second World War, Chinese officials proclaim that forgetting the past betrays the people. 
But. for the Chinese, the Cultural Revolution was itself a betrayal, one that continues to this day. 
All the terrible events since then – the Tiananmen Square massacre, persecution of Falun Gong, and repression of civic activists – are the evil fruit of that un-cleansed original sin. 
The Cultural Revolution marked the climax of class extermination practiced by the Party during the 1960’s. 
The survivors of all the previous political movements, now enthralled by Mao’s personality cult, were free of all constraint, able to kill and seek revenge with impunity. 
As Mao summed up this psychological state: “Now is a time of upheaval, and I’m just happy about the chaos.” 
Good people get to know each other by biting each other and it serves bad people right if they are bitten by good ones…” 
Friends of my generation invariably comment when I mention that I was born on August 18: “Hey, that was the anniversary of Chairman Mao first receiving the Red Guards.” 
These are people who, like the Hitler Youth, turned over their bloody page of history and never looked back. 
According to Wang Youqin, author of Victims of the Cultural Revolution , after Mao received the Red Guards and instructed them in the “militant fight,” more than 1,700 people were beaten, drowned, or scalded to death. 
Another 100,000 were driven from their homes. 
Within months, an all-out movement, under the banner of “revolutionize Chinese culture” and dedicated to the aim of “breaking away from old culture, old traditions, old thoughts, and old customs,” was raging throughout the country. 
Those who had been born “landlords, rich farmers, reactionaries, bad elements, and rightists” were among the first to be victimized. 
Desperate to save their lives, families voluntarily smashed their properties and pulped their ancient paintings and calligraphy. 
Episodes of “burning books and burying intellectuals alive” had occurred before, but none was more radical than the destructive force unleashed by Mao. 
Soon, ancient sites would be ruined. 
Corpses of historic figures, such as Zhang Zhidong, a high-ranking official in the Qing Dynasty, were exhumed, with the decaying bodies left hanging in trees. 
Eventually, anybody – from the President to average citizens – could be criticized, labeled an “ox-demon and snake-spirit,” persecuted, and listed for death. 
People killed others to safeguard Mao, and those who were executed shouted “Long Live Chairman Mao” on their way to death. 
In Guangxi province, where some of the worst violence occurred, nearly 100,000 people were killed during July and August 1968. 
In the official “Memorabilia of the Cultural Revolution in Guangxi,” many infants appear on the death list. 
The author Zheng Yi reported that in Wuxuan County alone, more than 100 people were eaten, because devouring enemies was the only way to prove one’s love for Mao. 
Livers, eyes, or brains were removed while victims were still alive. 
Mao set off yet another wave of persecutions in 1968. 
In countless “suicides,” many people were simply bitten to death, or took their own lives when the suffering became too much to bear. 
In Beijing, deaths occurred mostly in areas wuth trees and lakes. 
Wang Youqin reports that on November 4, four bodies were found floating in the lake of the Summer Palace. 
A total of 63 people were killed at the prestigious Beijing University. 
Mao died aspiring to exterminate Chinese culture. 
His Cultural Revolution alone killed as many as two million people, shattered traditions, uprooted spiritual and ethical values, and tore apart family ties and communal loyalties. 
People who experienced it seal off the memory, for the pain, worse than a bullet to the heart, overwhelms souls. 
Worst of all, Mao’s crimes against civilization, unlike those of, say, Hitler, are ongoing. 
The Communist Party still uses his brainwashing methods, and his legacy continues to be officially revered. 
His portrait and body remain on display in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, and his face appears on banknotes in the wallet of every Chinese, many of whom saw parents, children, and other loved ones die under his knife. 
The Chinese people, unsurprisingly, regard politics with a mixture of caution and dread. 
Public figures spend a lot of time and effort to avoid offending the Party, openly endorsing indifference as the foremost tool of survival. 
Last month, I watched a TV show featuring Han Meilin, a famous painter. 
In his closing remarks, he announced his words of wisdom to viewers: “Long live those who don’t care!” 
Han Meilin was badly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. 
His declaration was greeted by a roar of applause from the studio audience. 
The Revolutionary Conservative Pope 
Twenty-five years ago, Poland's people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow, as Pope. 
Some were frightened, others wept with joy. 
Here, said a prominent writer, was "Poland's second baptism." 
But even in our euphoria, we did not expect how much the new Pope would change not only Poland, but the world. 
His first return visit to his native country soon afterwards showed to all the world the new Pope's power. 
Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw, yet the streets became models of order. 
After decades of disempowerment, Poles suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination. 
In saying aloud that "there can be no just Europe without an independent Poland on its map," the Pope effectively swept away the unjust postwar settlement that had subjugated Poland to Soviet power. 
Then, in Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak in the name of everyone whose rights go unrecognized and violated anywhere in the world, I speak because I am bound, we are all bound, by truth." 
On that spot, that Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles, who remembered dear ones gassed to death in Auschwitz's crematoria as well as those frozen into glass in Siberia's concentration camps, to a brotherhood devoted to struggle against even justified hatred and revenge. 
Some see in the Pope the person responsible for a religious revival; others see a man of peace. 
Some see a defender of the poor, others a critic of liberation theology. 
For the people of Poland, John Paul II, by making human rights the central subject of his teaching, will forever be the man who gave us courage and hope, who restored our historical identity. 
Indeed, the central feature of the first decade of the Pope's reign was his struggle against dictatorship--Communist dictatorship in particular. 
The strategy formulated by the Pope for the Catholic Church, and his ability to mobilize millions of believers in its cause, meant that no one could ever again repeat Stalin's question: "How many divisions does the Pope have?" 
John Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon potent enough to undo Yalta's division of the world. 
Perhaps in part because of their strong anticommunist stance, the Polish Church and John Paul II are often branded as "conservative." 
The accusation is meant to suggest that the Church cannot live comfortably with a pluralist democracy. 
To be sure, in the struggle against Communism, the Polish Church was, indeed, conservative--and thank God for that! 
It was conservative in its absolute fidelity to evangelical values, to the truth of faith, to its historical identity. 
For the system of official atheism and legalized mendacity, the Church was a living rebuke. 
With Communism gone, however, the problem confronted by John Paul II and his Church today is this: in what language can evangelical values be articulated in a world where evil is not incarnated in a political system but is diffused in individual souls? 
What is the Pope's message for the postcommunist world he helped create? 
John Paul II undoubtedly keeps a distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal state, which he often charges with permissiveness and moral relativism. 
A critique of individualism in the name of collective values occurs frequently in the Pope's pronouncements. 
He sees the failings of liberalism as particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries. 
The market economy, despite its practical achievements, seems to him oftentimes to lack a heart and a human face. 
He sees the market as favoring entrepreneurship over human solidarity. 
So John Paul II is no enthusiast of modern Western civilization, with its divorce from the world of values, and he contrasts with it the moral sensitivity of societies with fresh memories of decades of dictatorship. 
Like Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Pope tends to believe that it was above all in resistance to totalitarianism that man could become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilization. 
I confess that I view the heritage of Communism with more skepticism. 
Totalitarian pressure did, indeed, form exceptional people such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, people for whom religious faith bought freedom from mendacity and solitude. 
But it did the same for Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel, who defended their supreme values with reference to, and in the language of, lay humanism. 
For most people, however, life under totalitarian dictatorship was not ennobling; it was, rather, a daily immersion in lies, spiritual depravity, and material corruption. 
This is why postcommunist societies do not demonstrate any nobility or disinterestedness that seriously contrasts with the West. 
Communism's defeat left a huge black hole in communities' souls, which is now being filled with nationalism, bigotry, and Western consumerism. 
But John Paul II's basic intuition is correct: the postcommunist world--East and West--is in spiritual crisis, and the Pope wants to shake it into realizing the importance of higher values. 
Indeed, by his words and example, the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort; he reminds us that we must also live in dignity. 
In the end, John Paul II does not fit neatly into any category and often represents a meeting of opposites: rejection of compromise with ecumenism, toughness with warmth, intellectual openness with insistence on theological orthodoxy. 
He is a conservative who loves freedom and a "peacemonger" who condemns injustice, but who reminds us that mercy is more important than justice. 
In this, he personifies the paradox that is Christianity: unbreakable and lasting principles joined by understanding and tolerance. 
Twenty-five years after John Paul II left Poland for Rome, we Poles remain grateful to him for having helped us regain our freedom. 
It is good that John Paul II is among us. 
A world where everything changes needs a guardian of what remains the same. 
The Revolutionary Ethics of Embryo Research 
What appeared to be the most momentous scientific advance of 2005 is currently under siege. 
In June, the prestigious journal Science published an article by the South Korean scientist Woo-Suk Hwang and an international team of co-authors describing how they had developed what were, in effect, “made to order” lines of human stem cells cloned from an adult. 
Although the scientific validity of their research is now the subject of several separate investigations, it is no less important to examine its ethical implications. 
Hwang and his colleagues claimed to have replaced the nucleus of an unfertilized human egg with the nucleus of an ordinary cell taken from another person, developing stem-cell lines from the resulting embryo that matched the DNA of the person who supplied the ordinary cell. 
That achievement appeared to take us significantly closer to a world in which patients could be given cell or tissue transplants that their bodies would not reject, because the biological materials, cloned from the patients themselves, would be a perfect match. 
At the beginning of December, Hwang disclosed that some of the eggs came from two women working in his lab, and that other “donors” had been paid for their eggs – a breach of ethical guidelines that had nothing to do with the accuracy of the science. 
But then Hwang’s collaborators began questioning the validity of the experiment itself, and Hwang notified Science that he wished to withdraw the paper. 
At the time of this writing, he still defends the validity of his work, while admitting “human errors” in the preservation of the stem-cell lines, including contamination by a fungus. 
He has reportedly even suggested that some cells may have been tampered with. 
We will not know how close we are to the production of individually tailored stem-cell lines until the scientific investigations into Hwang’s research are completed. 
Nevertheless, few researchers doubt that what Hwang and his colleagues claimed to do is, in principle, achievable. 
If Hwang was not the first to do it, someone else eventually will. 
Once it can be done reliably, it will pave the way for important medical breakthroughs. 
But the ethical significance of such research goes far beyond the undoubted importance of saving critically ill patients. 
Proving the possibility of cloning from the nucleus of an ordinary human cell would transform the debate about the value of potential human life, for we would find that “potential human life” was all around us, in every cell of our bodies. 
For example, when President George W. Bush announced in 2001 that the United States would not fund research into new stem-cell lines that are created from human embryos, he offered the following reason: “Like a snowflake, each of these embryos is unique, with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being.” 
But it is precisely this reasoning that is threatened by what Hwang and his team claimed to have achieved. 
If it is the uniqueness of human embryos that makes it wrong to destroy them, then there is no compelling reason not to take one cell from an embryo and destroy the remainder of it to obtain stem cells, for the embryo’s “unique genetic potential” would be preserved. 
This possibility highlights the weakness of the argument that abortion, too, is wrong because it destroys a genetically unique human being. 
By this reasoning, a woman who finds herself pregnant at an inconvenient time could have an abortion, as long as she preserves a single cell from the fetus to ensure that its unique genetic potential is preserved. 
But it seems absurd that this should make any difference to the morality of aborting the fetus. 
If, at a later date, the woman wants to have a child, why should she use the DNA of her earlier, aborted fetus rather than conceiving another fetus in the usual way? 
Each fetus – the one she aborts and the one she later conceives through sexual intercourse – has its own “unique” DNA. 
In the absence of special reasons, like a change in sexual partners, there seems to be no reason to prefer the existence of one child to that of the other. 
Perhaps the assumption is that, as opponents of abortion sometimes say, the aborted fetus had the genetic potential to become a Beethoven or an Einstein. 
But, for all we know, it is the next fetus that the woman will conceive, not the one she aborted, that will turn out to be the Beethoven or Einstein. 
So why prefer one genetic potential over the other? 
Once we abandon arguments based on potential, the claim that it is wrong to kill embryos and fetuses must be based on the nature of those entities themselves – that they are actual human beings who already possess the characteristics that make killing wrong. 
But, because fetuses, at least at the stage of development when most abortions are performed, have yet to develop any kind of consciousness, it seems reasonable to regard ending their lives as much less serious than killing a normal human being. 
If so, then this is all the more true of embryos. 
The Rich Should Keep Their Word 
For the first time in human history, the world is within striking distance of ending global poverty. 
A preposterous claim? 
Perhaps. 
After all, the poor seem to be everywhere and are increasing in numbers due to global recession, population growth, and economic mismanagement from Argentina to Zimbabwe. 
Yet, I'll stick to my claim. 
If the world - especially the US and other rich countries - shift a small amount of their military spending to meeting the needs of the world's poorest people, our generation could free humanity from poverty's iron grip. 
I am not speaking of relative poverty, the nearly inevitable fact that some members of society are worse off than others, though to some extent that varies society to society. 
I am speaking of the gut-wrenching, life-threatening poverty of living on less than $1 per day. 
For the first time ever, the world has it in its power to eliminate those extreme conditions. 
Why is this? 
The world's richest countries have continued their economic ascent for generations, carried forward by the flowering of science and technology. 
Even though poor countries seem to be falling ever farther behind, the truth is more heartening. 
Large parts of the so-called developing world, especially in Asia, have made incredible strides away from absolute poverty. 
China is the most striking success here, with hundreds of millions of people enjoying higher living standards in the past twenty years, including better health, nutrition, and sanitation. 
India achieved notable successes more recently, though much remains to be accomplished. 
The poorest of the poor in sub-Saharan Africa and in remote areas of Latin America and Central Asia have not shared these successes. 
At least 1 billion people, perhaps nearly twice that number, live in squalid conditions of hunger, disease, and impoverishment. 
In many of these countries, the past twenty years have marked a time of regress, not progress. 
Disease has swept Africa, with the AIDS pandemic and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis. 
Hunger afflicts hundreds of millions, as world weather patterns seem to become more erratic, with more dangerous droughts and floods associated perhaps with long-term changes in the climate. 
Millions die each year of poverty - lives that could be saved if the poor had access to better health care, nutrition, and other essential needs. 
The extreme poverty of the bottom billion people is shocking, morally intolerable, and dangerous - a breeding ground of disease, terrorism, and violence. 
Yet with the richest countries richer than ever before, and with much of the developing world already escaped from the horrors of extreme poverty, the balance has shifted in favor of ending global poverty. 
Rich countries could enable the poorest of the poor to escape from misery by providing just a tiny fraction of their yearly national income - or, indeed, of their military spending - to overcome the crises of hunger, education, and disease. 
That aid, combined with the market-based economic growth, could end extreme poverty. 
Importantly, rich countries are committed to working with the poorest countries to meet these objectives. 
But as with many promises, America and other donor countries have so far failed to live up to their pledges. 
At the UN's Millennium Summit in September 2000, the world's leaders made solemn pledges to tackle global poverty. 
They issued a declaration calling for action now, so that extreme poverty can be dramatically reduced by the year 2015. 
They even pledged to mobilize financial assistance. 
Within the broad Millennium Declaration is a set of specific targets for reducing poverty, disease, hunger, illiteracy, and environmental degradation. They provide explicit, detailed commitments. 
For example, rich and poor countries together have committed to reducing infant mortality rates by two-thirds as of 2015, compared with the levels in countries as of 1990. 
Sadly, for dozens of countries around the world, that target is not being met, because too little money is invested in health. 
Many studies, including those that I did for the World Health Organization, show that for a modest amount of money worldwide, perhaps an extra $50 - $100 billion per year in aid from rich countries, the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved. 
That may seem like a lot of money, but not in comparison with the $25 trillion in income each year earned by rich countries, or the roughly $500 billion spent each year on their militaries. 
Much of the world looks at the US and other rich countries with resentment, feeling that they don't keep their commitments to help less fortunate countries. 
The rich world can redeem itself, indeed promote its interests in global peace and prosperity, by proving that the Millennium Development Goals are not empty words. 
The key test of those commitments will come next month at a UN Conference in Monterrey, Mexico on Finance for Development. 
The conference will focus on the bottom line - where is the money to fight poverty and disease? 
Will the rich follow promises with actions? 
In Monterrey, rich countries can show the rest of humanity, especially the poorest of the poor, that they've gotten the message. 
Let's hope, for our common future, that the world's leaders get it right this time around. 
The Richest Get Richer 
Card-carrying neo-liberals like me, who pushed for opening capital flows wide in the early 1990's, had a particular vision in mind. 
But the future that we hoped for did not come to pass. 
We looked at how extraordinarily strongly the world's system of relative prices was tilted against the poor: how cheap were the products they exported, and how expensive were the capital goods that they needed to import in order to industrialize and develop. 
"Why not free up capital flows and so encourage large-scale lending from the rich to the poor?" we asked. 
Such large-scale lending might cut a generation off the time it would take economies where people were poor to converge with the industrial structures and living standards of rich countries. 
Certainly such large-scale borrowing and lending had played a key role in the late-19th century. Canada, the western United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and South Africa: all were developed due to imported capital a century ago. 
But things didn't turn out that way this time around. 
Instead of capital flowing from rich to poor, just the opposite happened: it flowed from poor to rich, the overwhelmingly largest stream going to the US, whose rate of capital inflow is now the largest of any country, anywhere, anytime. 
What has fed these inflows? 
One source is central banks seeking to keep the value of their home currencies down so that their workers can gain valuable experience from exporting to the rich world. 
Another source is investors who feared losing their money after the various emerging market meltdowns of the 1990's, techno-enthusiasts chasing the pot of gold that the American technology boom seemed to offer, and the third-world rich, who think a Deutsche Bank account is good to have in case they need to flee their countries in a Lear jet or a rubber boat. 
All of these sources contributed to the flow of money into the US, which was thus enabled to invest much more than it had managed to save. 
America's economy became - and remains - a giant vacuum cleaner, soaking up the world's spare investment cash. 
So those of us who still wish to be flag-waving advocates for international capital mobility are reduced to two arguments. 
First, and most important, capital controls create ideal conditions for large-scale corruption. 
With capital controls, people who badly want to move their capital across borders can't - unless they find some complaisant bureaucrat. 
But an effective market economy needs to minimize the incentives and opportunities for corruption, or it will turn into something worse. 
Second, perhaps the inflow of capital into America was and remains justified: perhaps there is something uniquely valuable about investments in America today. 
(But in that case, if these investment opportunities are so great, why aren't Americans themselves saving more - both privately and publicly - to take advantage of them?) 
The years 1960 to 1985 formed the era in which development was to be financed by public institutions like the World Bank, because market failures and distrust of governments made it hard for poor countries to borrow privately. 
The years 1985 to 2000 were the era in which development was to be financed by private lending to countries that adopted the market-friendly and market-conforming policies that were supposed to lead to high returns and rapid growth. 
The first era was not an unqualified success. 
Looking at the capital flow reversal into the US, I cannot argue that the second era has been an unqualified success either. 
It is nice that Mexican workers and entrepreneurs are gaining experience in export manufactures, and successful enough to run a trade surplus vis-à-vis the US. 
But the flip side of the trade surplus is the capital outflow. 
Should capital-poor Mexico really be financing a further jump in the capital intensity of the US economy? 
It is not possible for a card-carrying neo-liberal like me to wish for anything but the most minor of controls to curb speculative of capital flows. 
Capital markets can get the allocation of investment badly wrong, but governments are likely to get it wrong even worse, and the incentives to corrupt bureaucrats do need to be kept as low as possible. 
But the hope for a repetition of the late 19th-century experience has - so far - proved vain. 
Unlike in the heyday of liberalism, money from the world's rich countries simply is not going to give peripheral economies the priceless gift of rapid, successful development. 
The Right Populism for Poland 
Poland’s parliamentary and presidential elections this month saw the death of a left-leaning postcommunist party that mostly dominated the country since 1995. 
But the demise of the left does not mean that the right has a coherent economic program. 
For the victorious coalition of the Law and Justice (PiS) party and Civic Platform (PO) is torn between liberal (PO) and populist instincts (PiS). 
If PiS’s populist slogans become policy, government spending is likely to expand, which will exacerbate Poland’s already weak fiscal position and consequently trigger inflationary expectations. 
Worse, boosting social spending will contribute little to resolving the country’s staggering 17.5% rate of unemployment – most of it structural –while any hope of quick euro adoption will be dashed. 
What Poland needs most is fiscal discipline and market-oriented reforms, including relaxation of the rigid labor laws that are inhibiting job creation. 
After all, over the past two decades, the enduring goals of dismantling communism and central planning, as well as joining the European Union, have served as important driving forces of reform. 
But can the political will for renewed reform be mustered in a government that is half liberal and half populist? 
A specific commitment to adopt the euro at the earliest possible date could serve as the same sort of springboard as the push to join the EU in the 1990’s. 
Such a strategic goal would provide justification for prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and, given Poles’ desire to consider themselves full Europeans, it would boost political support for such policies. 
Only such support can bring the government budget deficit, expected to reach 4.4% of GDP in 2005, down to the EU’s benchmark of less than 3% of GDP within the next two years. 
Moreover, a commitment to pursue euro membership will have positive spillover effects. 
It will reinforce convergence expectations among financial market participants, which will translate into lower risk premia for investors. 
Lower risk also will bring inflation expectations down and reduce interest rates, which will in turn speed up the compression of Polish government bond yields to comparable EU levels, increasing financial stability. 
While the current yield on 10-year Polish government bonds of 4.7% appears to be at the edge of meeting the Maastricht long-term interest-rate benchmark, sustainability will depend on the fiscal policy outlook and on the overall credit risk. 
More stable financial markets and a less volatile exchange rate relative to the euro will bring many advantages. 
Most importantly, lower exchange-rate risk will boost both domestic and foreign direct investment, thereby helping to alleviate unemployment. 
So it is imperative that the new government prepares – in cooperation with the National Bank of Poland (NBP) – a comprehensive program to steer the course of fiscal and monetary policy toward the goal of euro membership. 
Although there is no need immediately to announce a specific exchange rate for the zloty at euro entry, such a program must include among its focal points a formula for determining the rate. 
By developing and disclose to the public a compelling rationale for what will determine the exchange rate when the time comes, the financial markets would then be able to forecast the future reference exchange rate more precisely. 
This would reduce the potential for speculative currency arbitrage and mitigate exchange-rate risk in the run-up to euro adoption, which would contribute to lower market interest rates, as their level always incorporates the prevalent exchange-rate risk. 
There is little doubt among economists that euro membership will bring enduring net benefits to Poland. 
It will lower transaction costs and increase labor productivity. 
But it will do so only if serious institutional deficiencies are eliminated. 
These include legal impediments to labor mobility, reform of a complex tax system beset by excessive rates and porous loopholes, and substandard road infrastructure. 
Each should be regarded as an urgent matter by the new government, and each, if handled adroitly, could be “sold” to the public as the type of popular reform that people have been demanding. 
Poland’s new government faces several serious challenges, not the least of which will be to reconcile its liberal and populist tendencies. 
Only if populism is put at the service of liberal reform will the government achieve lasting benefits. 
The Right Priorities for the G8 
In the run-up to the G8 meeting in Scotland on July 6-8, British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called on the international community to set the right global priorities, which he has unequivocally stated should be Africa and global warming. 
Blair is right in challenging us to set priorities. But his choice is probably wrong. 
While we should accept his challenge, we should also get our priorities right. 
Political leaders rarely espouse clear priorities, preferring to seem capable of giving everything to everybody. 
They must work with bureaucracies, which are naturally disinclined to have their efforts prioritized, lest they end up as anything less than number one. 
Whenever we prioritize, we not only say where we should do more (which is good) but also where we should not increase our efforts (which is regarded as cynical). 
But not talking about priorities does not make the need to prioritize go away. 
Instead, the choices only become less clear, less democratic, and less efficient. 
Refusing to prioritize, dealing mainly with the most publicized problems, is wrong. 
Imagine doctors at a perpetually overrun hospital refusing to perform triage on casualties, merely attending patients as they arrived and fast-tracking those whose families made the most fuss. 
Refusing to prioritize is unjust, wastes resources, and costs lives. 
So what should be our top global priorities? 
This question was addressed in a groundbreaking project involving a long list of the world’s top economists at the Copenhagen Consensus last year. 
A “dream team” of eight economists, including three Nobel Laureates, confronted the basic question: if the world had, say, an extra $50 billion to do good, where could that money best be spent? 
The top priority turned out to be HIV/AIDS prevention. 
A comprehensive program would cost $27 billion, but the potential social benefits would be immense: avoidance of more than 28 million new cases of HIV/AIDS by 2010. 
This makes it the best investment the world could make, reaping social benefits that outweigh the costs by 40 to 1. 
Similarly, providing micronutrients missing from more than half the world’s diet would reduce diseases caused by deficiencies of iron, zinc, iodine, and Vitamin A with an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to cost. 
If we could only find the political will, establishing free trade could be achieved at a very low cost, with benefits of up to $2.4 trillion a year. 
Fighting malaria pays off at least five times the costs. 
Mosquito nets and effective medication could halve the incidence of malaria and would cost $13 billion. 
The list goes on to focus on agricultural technologies to tackle food production and hunger, as well as technologies to boost the supply of clean drinking water and improve sanitation. 
Given that these problems are most acute in Africa, Blair’s priorities have some merit. 
But the Copenhagen Consensus showed us not only what we should be doing, but also what should not be done – at least not right now. 
The experts rated responses to climate change extremely low on the “to do” list. 
In fact, the panel called these ventures – including the Kyoto Protocol – “bad projects” because they cost more than the good they do. 
This does not mean that we should ignore climate change. 
Global warming is real. 
But the Kyoto rules will make an almost imperceptible difference (postponing temperature increases from 2100 to 2106) at a substantial cost (about $150 billion per year). 
Given scarce resources, we must ask ourselves: do we want to do a lot of good now, or a little good much later? 
We need to ask if we can do more for the world by investing differently. 
Far from suggesting a policy of laissez faire, this question addresses the pressing problem of prioritization head on. 
Why did thousands die in Haiti during the recent hurricanes and not in Florida? 
Because Haitians are poor. 
They cannot take preventive measures. 
Breaking the cycle of poverty by addressing the most pressing issues of disease, hunger, and polluted water will not only do obvious good, but also make people less vulnerable. 
The G-8 meeting has put global prioritization on the agenda. 
Now is the time to get our priorities right. 
The urgent problem of the poor majority of this world is not climate change. 
Their problems are more basic: not dying from easily preventable diseases; not being malnourished from lack of simple micronutrients; not being prevented from exploiting opportunities in the global economy by lack of free trade. 
We can prevent HIV by handing out condoms and improving health education. 
We can prevent millions from dying from malnutrition simply by distributing vitamin supplements. 
These are not space-age technologies, but staple goods that the world needs. 
Doing the best things first would be a great investment in the planet’s future. 
If we are serious about solving the world’s most serious challenges, we owe it to ourselves to set the right priorities. 
Anchoring the Arab Awakening 
LONDON – The economic situation in the countries of the so-called Arab Awakenings is deteriorating quickly. 
Egypt is running low on cash – before recent rescue loans, currency reserves covered less than three months of imports – and Egyptians are hoarding fuel and foodstuffs in anticipation of future shortages. 
More frequent and longer-lasting power outages foretell worse to come in an economy already struggling with mass unemployment, widespread exclusion, and deep pockets of poverty. 
Short-term macroeconomic stability is the immediate priority in Egypt and the other Arab Awakening countries. 
In the medium term, however, the viability of the current order is at stake – and not only in these countries, but across the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. 
With so much at stake, Majid Jafar of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum was right to worry at the recent World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa at the Dead Sea. 
His proposal of an Arab Stabilization Plan, inspired by the post-1945 Marshall Plan in Western Europe, is laudable. 
The imperative for large-scale coordinated action is overwhelming. But is the Marshall Plan the right model? 
The Marshall Plan was a macroeconomic strategy involving massive capital transfers to help reconstruct the war-ravaged industrial capacity and infrastructure of economies with well-developed institutions. 
But what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented, project-based, and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world. 
In a joint report on the competitiveness of the Arab countries, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Economic Forum call for urgent institutional reform to support private-sector growth. 
Excessive red tape and ineffective enforcement of competition policy and governance rules are hampering entrepreneurship throughout the region. 
Massive investments are also needed in education to eradicate deep pockets of illiteracy, raise overall skill levels, and better match skills to the demands of the market. 
Perhaps surprisingly, there is widespread consensus in the Arab Awakening countries that the private sector is central to sustained job creation and growth. 
We saw this recently when the EBRD, together with the British-based organization Forward Thinking, conducted a closed-door workshop for 27 leading representatives of parties from across the political spectrum in the region. 
Two days of intensive discussions revealed important differences in perspective, but also many commonalities. 
Private-sector development clearly means different things to different people. 
The parties on the right largely embrace free-market thinking, while Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and its kindred parties in Libya and Tunisia are deeply sceptical of the state, which they view as bloated, inept, and ultimately corrupt. 
Moreover, the existing banks have failed to serve these parties’ small-business and farming constituencies. 
Achieving ambitious goals for inclusive growth and job creation quickly without an enabling state and without using the banking system will be extremely difficult. 
Without question, the main responsibility for building these countries’ political systems and reforming their economies rests with their citizens. 
Outside intervention has left too many scars in the public’s collective memory. 
But the region can look to the successful transition in Central Europe and the powerful anchor for reforms provided by these countries’ accession to the European Union. Countries like Hungary and Poland can hardly be accused of having a hidden agenda when they share their development experience. 
Much can also be learned from countries like Turkey, which has managed to create a dynamic and innovative private sector. 
The good news is that the economies of the Arab Awakening countries do not suffer from the deep distortions that characterized post-communist Europe. 
Many of the early reforms have already been implemented, and reasonably sophisticated banking systems are in place. 
In post-communist Europe, banks had to be built from scratch out of the rubble of socialism. 
As a result, while political uncertainty will take its toll on economic growth, the Arab Awakening countries should not have to face a transitional recession, as post-communist Europe did in the 1990’s. 
On the other hand, they are unlikely to benefit from the subsequent robust growth that most European transition countries experienced. 
Jafar is right that the Arab Awakening countries need a plan. 
But it should be a plan for private-sector-led inclusive growth, supported by efforts in the rest of the Arab world and in the EU. 
Most critically, it must be a plan owned by the countries themselves and based on an approach that recognizes the critical roles of an enabling state and a catalytic financial sector. 
The ongoing socio-political transition, underpinned by widespread public recognition of the need for change, provides a historic opportunity to embark on growth-enhancing reforms. 
The Right to Die 
On December 21, an Italian doctor, Mario Riccio, disconnected a respirator that was keeping Piergiorgio Welby alive. 
Welby, who suffered from muscular dystrophy and was paralyzed, had battled unsuccessfully in the Italian courts for the right to die. 
After Riccio gave him a sedative and switched off the respirator, Welby said “thank you” three times to his wife, his friends, and his doctor. 
Forty-five minutes later, he was dead. 
Welby’s request to die was widely publicized in Italy, where it led to heated debate. 
At the time of writing, it is unclear whether Riccio will be charged with any offense. 
At least one Italian politician has called for his arrest on a charge of homicide. 
Welby’s death raises two questions, which need to be distinguished. 
One is whether a person has a right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment. 
The other is whether voluntary euthanasia is ethically defensible. 
A patient’s informed consent should be a prerequisite for all medical treatment, as long as the patient is a competent adult in a position to make a decision. 
Forcing medical treatment on a competent adult patient who does not want it is tantamount to assault. 
We may think that the patient is making the wrong decision, but we should respect his or her right to make it. 
That right is recognized in most countries, but not, apparently, in Italy. 
Even the Roman Catholic Church has long held that there is no obligation to use “extraordinary” or “disproportionate” means to prolong life – a view reiterated in the “Declaration on Euthanasia” issued by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by Pope John Paul II in 1980. 
That document states that to refuse a burdensome medical treatment “is not the equivalent of suicide.” 
On the contrary, such a refusal “should be considered an acceptance of the human condition, or a wish to avoid the application of a medical procedure disproportionate to the results that can be expected, or a desire not to impose excessive expense on the family or the community.” 
That description applies well to Welby’s decision. 
On this view, Riccio was doing what anyone should have been prepared to do for Welby, who was paralyzed and unable to implement his refusal of a burdensome medical treatment. 
If the Welby case falls on the right side of the line drawn by Roman Catholic doctrine, the deeper question is whether Church doctrine draws the line in a place that makes sense. 
If an incurably ill patient can refuse burdensome treatment, knowing that this refusal will mean his or her death, why should an incurably ill patient who is not being kept alive by any medical treatment, but finds that the illness itself makes life burdensome, be unable to seek assistance in escaping that burden? 
Defenders of Catholic teaching would answer that in the latter case, the patient intends to end his life, and that is wrong, whereas in the former case, the patient merely intends to avoid the additional burden that treatment brings. 
Death is, of course, a foreseeable consequence of avoiding that burden, but it is a byproduct that is not directly intended. 
If the patient could avoid the burden and yet continue to live, that would be his choice. 
Welby should not have been helped to die, they might argue, because he expressly said that he wanted to die, not that he wanted to avoid a burdensome treatment. 
This distinction is dubious. 
In both cases, the patient knowingly chooses a course of action that will lead to her or his death, rather than an alternative course of action that would have led to a longer but burdensome life. 
By focusing on the narrower intention to refuse burdensome treatment, rather than the broader implications of the choice, the Roman Catholic Church is able to avoid the inhumane implication that patients must always accept life-prolonging treatment, no matter how painful or costly such treatment may be. 
But it does so at the cost of rendering incoherent its own vigorous opposition to assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia. 
Many countries recognize a legal right to refuse medical treatment. 
But only in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and the American state of Oregon are physicians permitted to assist a patient in ending his or her life by means other than withdrawing life-sustaining medical treatment. 
The Netherlands, in particular, has been subjected to a relentless campaign of vilification. 
Critics allege that the legalization of voluntary euthanasia has led to a breakdown of trust in the medical profession and all sorts of other dire consequences. 
But if these allegations are true, no one has told the Dutch. 
Despite a change of government in the Netherlands since voluntary euthanasia was legalized, no effort has been made to repeal the measure. 
There is simply no public support for such a move. 
The Dutch know how voluntary euthanasia is practiced in their country, they know that legal euthanasia has improved, rather than harmed, their medical care, and they want the possibility of assistance in dying, if they should want and need it. 
Isn’t that a choice that everyone should have? 
The Right to Equality, Then and Now 
LONDON – Following weeks of financial and economic turmoil, public debate has finally turned to the horrific potential human ramifications of the collapse of the global financial system. 
Comparisons and contrasts with the Great Depression of the 1930’s have inevitably become a central part of that discourse – and rightly so. 
There is much that the world can and must learn now from the lowest point of the twentieth century. 
Above all, we have got to heed the proven need for applying social – as well as economic – interventions in a time of economic crisis. 
Recession and depression can lead to exclusion and, at worst, persecution of societies’ most vulnerable groups. 
That is why the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights was adopted in 1948, and why we need, more urgently than ever, to establish universal equality for all human beings. 
Nations must act now to ensure that everyone – regardless of wealth, ethnicity, sex, or religion – has the same rights, and that these rights are enshrined in laws at the time they are enacted. 
This October, 128 leading experts in the fields of human rights and equality from 44 countries launched a landmark attempt to build on the epochal 1948 UN declaration to establish universal human equality. 
We did so by launching a “Declaration on Principles of Equality” – a declaration that builds on its historical precursor to establish, for the first time ever, general legal principles that define equality as a basic human right. 
Based on a total of 27 principles, the Declaration reflects a moral and professional consensus among human rights and equality experts and is the product of more than a year’s work led by the United Kingdom-based Equal Rights Trust. 
Needless to say, reaching a consensus among such a diverse group of people from around the world was not easy. 
Equality means different things to different people – and at different times. 
Interpretations largely depend on the practical realities of the social, cultural, and political environment in which the principles of equality operate. 
All signatories to our new Declaration agreed that incitement to violence that is motivated by race or gender or sexual orientation constitutes a serious violation of the right to equality. 
Some American civil rights lawyers, out of natural deference to the United States Constitution’s First Amendment were, however, reluctant to sign up to this principle unless it was qualified by a reference to the threat of “imminent” violence. 
Some participants from the developing countries wanted poverty to be declared a proscribed basis of discrimination, while others argued that poverty is far too vague a concept to be the subject of legal rights and duties. 
Some contended that absolute poverty differs from relative poverty, or asked what responsibility individuals have to raise themselves out of poverty through education and work? 
These participants argued that specific legal duties, such as the right to a minimum wage and the right to vocational training, are more effective than the vague extension of anti-discrimination law to cover poverty as such. 
The result was a compromise between these two groups. 
For all these differences of opinion, we are unanimous in the belief that, if the Principles of Equality are to be effective in our age, they have to go well beyond the negative anti-discrimination model that was adopted in the US and Europe in the second half of the twentieth century. 
They must, instead, encourage nations positively to promote the principle of equal rights in keeping with current interpretations of international obligation. 
The declaration that we have developed regards equality as a “freestanding right.” 
In other words, it exists as a separate right, and is not dependent on the violation of some other legal right, such as the right to education. 
It follows, then, that the right to equality could be violated even where another legal right – to, say, housing or employment – does not exist. 
The right to equality would exist in all areas of activity regulated by domestic, international or regional law. 
It would apply to everyone, regardless of nationality or statelessness, including refugees and asylum seekers, and it would place a positive obligation on states to “promote and fulfill” the right to equality. 
A new declaration was badly needed when we began work on it one year ago. 
Today, it is crucial if we are to prevent an even greater chasm from dividing the world’s haves and have-nots. 
The Right to Massacre? 
NEW YORK – The shootings of United States Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and others in Arizona last month are but the latest in a series of mass shootings in the US in which the (alleged) perpetrator suffered from an apparent mental disorder. 
Predictably, the Arizona tragedy has elicited calls for policy changes. 
But what, if anything, should be done differently? 
The vast majority of severely mentally disordered individuals are not violent. 
Predicting which few without a prior history of violence will become violent is almost impossible. 
At the same time, proposals to protect society from the dangerously mentally ill pose basic civil-liberties issues. 
A Russian reporter, Andrei Sitov, raised this question when he asserted at a White House press conference that American freedom was complicit in the Arizona shootings: “As to why – it does not seem all that incomprehensible, at least from the outside. 
It’s the reverse side of freedom. 
Unless you want restrictions, unless you want a bigger role for the government...This is America, democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, the freedom to petition your government. 
And many people outside would also say the ‘freedom’ of a deranged mind to react in a violent way is also American.” 
President Barack Obama’s press secretary answered defensively that American values do not endorse violence. 
That is true, but irrelevant. 
The question is whether American values favoring individual rights somehow facilitated the Arizona tragedy. 
After all, rates of severe mental illness are about the same across the developed world, yet the US seems to have more such shootings than do other countries. 
One freedom-related suggestion is that the US needs stricter laws that keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. 
But the alleged shooter had never been formally diagnosed as mentally ill, so such targeted laws would not have prevented him from obtaining a gun. 
General gun control is essential, but unlikely for now. 
The US also needs more accessible mental-health services. 
Although his college demanded professional evaluation before he would be allowed to return, the suspect in the Arizona shootings, it seems, failed to seek help from Tucson’s available services. 
Unlike those with physical illnesses, mentally ill individuals often are unaware – even vehemently deny – that they have a problem, thus forgoing treatment and losing desperately needed disability benefits. 
Many colleges have increased monitoring of students’ odd behavior by threat-assessment teams. 
But such mass screening is notoriously ineffective in predicting violence, often yielding enormous numbers of misidentified threats. 
For example, psychiatric screening for suicide risk in one New York high school identified 44% of the student body as being at risk. 
Similarly, screening for loose, eccentric thinking yields mostly individuals who never become psychiatrically disordered. 
In the months before the shootings, the suspect’s behavior displayed marked signs of serious mental problems, including confusing speech, disruptiveness in class, bizarre imagery, deterioration in social, academic, and occupational functioning, and a dramatic personality change. 
With such blatant signals, why didn’t others intervene? 
Arizona law allows any interested party to report an individual’s bizarre or threatening behavior to the authorities, who can involuntarily commit the individual for psychiatric evaluation. 
Though his community college suspended the suspect for his threatening demeanor, it took no further action. 
One reason is that American educational privacy laws severely restrict the sharing of information, even with parents, let alone with other authorities. 
Additional privacy protections for medical records sometimes make it difficult to notify parents when a child is troubled. 
Moreover, the US Constitution prohibits preventive detention: even severely disturbed individuals cannot be detained involuntarily unless judged an imminent threat to themselves or others. 
College counselors apparently did not think that the suspect met this demanding threshold. 
Although disruptive, the suspect was able to function – as shown by the disciplined nature of the attack. 
Such protections should not be surrendered easily. 
The irony of Sitov’s comment is that during the Soviet era, Russian political dissidents were psychiatrically diagnosed, institutionalized, and drugged into submission. 
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, paving the way for the political abuse of psychiatric diagnosis, argued that, “Of those who might start calling for opposition to Communism…, we can say that clearly their mental state is not normal.” 
The line between angry political extremism or eccentric normality and delusional mental disorder is tricky to draw. 
If restrictions on involuntary commitment to prevent crime are eased, zealous prosecutors could circumvent civil liberties. 
Such abuses have emerged when preventive institutionalization has passed constitutional muster, as in the laws some US states have enacted in order to incarcerate “sexually violent predators.” 
So, what can be done? 
Sitov was correct to the extent that the Arizona shootings were likely facilitated by a uniquely American interaction between legal protection of individual privacy and freedom, lack of strong community bonds and resources, and easy access to handguns. 
Americans must acknowledge that educational and medical privacy laws require limited exceptions for notification of family and authorities when clear signs of severe mental illness surface, so that colleges and other institutions can take timely action. 
Adequate community mental-health services with educational outreach can induce disturbed youth to get help voluntarily. 
Perhaps prudent loosening of the imminent-harm standard for involuntary commitment in clear cases of severe disorder might be helpful. 
Screening, if carefully targeted to limit errors, also may have a role to play. 
Finally, improved gun control vis-à-vis the severely mentally ill is imperative. 
Such measures might have prevented the Arizona shootings. 
A stronger community response, supported by limited exceptions to legal restrictions on information-sharing, could have allowed involuntary evaluation of the suspect. 
If he refused treatment and was released because he posed no imminent threat, his severe mental disorder would nonetheless have been diagnosed. 
Placing him immediately on a “watch list” for weapons – frequently updated under strengthened laws – could have prevented him from purchasing the gun and ammunition he subsequently used. 
The Right Way to Beat Chinese Inflation 
WASHINGTON, DC – High inflation is threatening social stability in China, soaring from 3.3% in March 2007 to 8.3% in March 2008. 
As a result, the People’s Bank of China has raised interest rates substantially and increased banks’ reserve requirements. 
The trick for the Chinese government will be to quell inflation in a way that does not compromise its long-term goal of continued strong economic growth. 
The risks are high. 
China’s accelerating inflation reflects a similar climb in its GDP growth rate, from the already high 11% in 2006 to 11.5 % in 2007. 
The proximate cause of price growth since mid-2007 is the appearance of production bottlenecks as domestic demand exceeds supply in an increasing number of sectors, such as power generation, transportation, and intermediate-goods industries. 
Sustained robust growth and rising aggregate demand have also caused production bottlenecks outside of China, most notably in the agricultural commodity and mining sectors, which have helped lift oil prices to more than $100 per barrel. 
Adding to these woes are two other inflationary factors: first, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS, or “blue-ear disease”) has been killing pigs – China’s main meat source – nationwide, and, second, terrible storms in January reduced the supply of grain and vegetables. 
In these circumstances, continuing to raise borrowing costs would be a mistake. 
To be sure, the prolonged rapid increase in Chinese aggregate demand has been fueled by an investment boom, as well as a growing trade surplus. 
Thus, lowering inflation would require reducing the growth rate (if not the level) of these two demand components. 
But Chinese policymakers should focus more on reducing the trade surplus and less on reducing investment spending – that is, they should emphasize renminbi (RMB) appreciation over higher interest rates to cool the economy. 
A sizeable reduction in aggregate demand through RMB appreciation is achievable without being imprudent, because the current-account surplus in 2007 was 9.5 % of GDP. 
Investment (especially in infrastructure in backward areas and social investments) should not bear the brunt of the expenditure squeeze, because today’s investment is also tomorrow’s growth in production capacity; and the production of more goods tomorrow would reduce inflation. 
Using RMB appreciation as the primary tool to fight inflation implies accepting a temporarily higher unemployment rate now in exchange for a permanently lower unemployment rate in the future. 
This is because manufactured exports are typically more labor-intensive than investment projects. 
As a result, a RMB1 billion reduction in exports would create more unemployment than a RMB1 billion reduction in investment spending. 
But tomorrow’s capacity expansion from today’s investment would mean a permanent increase in the number of jobs created from tomorrow onward. 
Nevertheless, China must be careful when implementing RMB appreciation. 
Policy makers should closely monitor potential changes in the economic conditions in the G-7. 
A deep recession in the United States resulting from the sub-prime crisis would significantly lower Chinese exports and cut the prices of oil and other primary commodities. 
In that case, a large RMB appreciation undertaken now would be overkill. 
Moreover, the authorities should recognize that RMB appreciation is unlikely to reduce US-China trade tensions. 
Consider the experience of Japan-bashing in the 1980’s, when the Yen-Dollar end-year exchange rate plunged from 248 in 1984 to 162 in 1986, and then to 123 in 1988. 
While Japan’s overall current-account surplus declined significantly, from 3.7% of GDP in 1985 to 2.7% in 1988, the overall US current-account deficit only fell from 2.8% of GDP to 2.4%, because Japanese companies started investing in production facilities in Southeast Asia for export to the US. 
So Japan-bashing continued under a new guise: the additional demand that Japan must remove its “structural impediments” to import. 
In short, substantial RMB appreciation would reduce the bilateral US-China trade deficit and China’s overall trade surplus significantly, but it would do little to reduce the overall US trade deficit. 
In the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies, possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit. 
A stronger RMB can help only the overheated Chinese economy. 
And it has the virtue of doing so without hurting China’s future production capacity. 
The Right Way to Electric Cars 
NEW YORK – Excitement about electric cars abounds nowadays, but consider the number of existing gasoline-powered cars: about 850 million. 
It would take years of new-car sales to make a dent in that number. 
That fact at first depressed Jiri Räsänen, a civil servant in Helsinki – but then it gave him and his friends a good idea. Why not keep the cars but replace their engines? 
That idea would solve a lot of problems, starting not just with today’s installed base of cars, but with the installed base of car makers . 
Even though many of them are in trouble, it’s probably not the best time to start a new car company, either. 
Yet while the market for new cars has slowed dramatically, it could be a good time to start a business replacing gasoline engines with electric ones. 
The group’s initiative, led by Räsänen, is called eCars - Now! 
A small operation in Finland, it is less a company than a role model for companies that the team hopes will spring up worldwide. 
Borrowing from the open-software movement, Räsänen and his colleagues want to make the idea and the basic designs free, and encourage lots of companies all over the world to implement it locally. 
Some companies will make batteries or electric engines or retrofit kits; others will retrofit gasoline cars with the new engines – a great job opportunity for unemployed auto workers. 
eCars- Now! hopes to foster an ecosystem of car service workers and parts makers similar to the ecosystem of open-software programmers and generic computer hardware. 
Of course, the parallels end at some point, because batteries and engines aren’t quite the equivalent of PCs, but the ethos is much the same. 
Räsänen and his team started by measuring the potential demand for electric cars in Finland. 
“No one had done that before in Finland,” he recalls. 
“We decided that if we could get 500 people to show interest in a converted car, we could demonstrate that the mass conversion scheme would make sense.” 
It took eCars – Now! only 11 days to sign up 500 interested customers. 
To be sure, they merely indicated interest; they did not send money. 
But the company’s Web site continues to attract new prospects, with 1,000 people now registered as likely or certain to buy such a vehicle. 
The site also solicited advice on which car to convert. 
The Toyota Corolla was the first choice – hardly surprising since it is the leading car model in Finland (with 7% of the market). 
Just 15 months later, in May of this year, a retrofitted Corolla demo model with an engine from Detroit-based Azure Dynamics was on display at the Electric Vehicle Symposium, a trade show in Stavanger, Norway. 
What will it take to make this idea work? 
To some extent, it’s already working – by spreading. 
Local efforts may succeed or fail based on the talents of local implementers. 
In Italy, inventor Roberto Vezzi had a Smart-EV project along the same lines. 
He has now joined the eCars – Now! movement, and his eSmart car will be upgraded with the open-source graphical user interface being developed for the eCorolla in Finland. 
Other initiatives are springing up in Denmark, Latvia, Spain, and Turkey, says Räsänen. 
The group is now looking for an initial manufacturer/assembler for the retrofit kits (as opposed to the engines inside them). 
In the meantime, eCorolla and the eSmart will go through testing. 
Overall, the economics make sense. 
Produced on an appropriate scale, a kit should cost about $20,000, including distribution costs and a profit margin. 
It should take about eight hours for two workers in a professional garage to install such a kit, or less than a week for the car-owner himself/herself (or, as they say, two weeks if the owner’s spouse “helps”). 
That’s considerably less than the cost of a new car – especially an electric one. 
The real economic benefit, however, is in the cost savings thereafter. 
To be sure, a lot will depend on the availability of convenient charging stations, but they are starting to appear. 
The project is deconstructing the car industry – probably in a more effective way than American government officials are doing in Detroit. 
In Finland, at least, all you need from the government is a certificate of inspection, which costs about €100 ($135). 
If all goes well, a host of electric car-engine and retrofit kit makers will appear, serving different markets of existing car owners. 
Dealers and mechanics will install the batteries, comprising a new corps of workers devoted (indirectly) to cleaning up the environment and adding value to the installed base of cars. 
Any far-sighted government could help not by subsidizing these efforts, but by buying up the old gasoline engines. 
That provides an incentive to retrofitting companies, while competition for customers, rather than for subsidies, will encourage the various providers to be efficient. 
(Many European governments currently have “cash-for-clunker” schemes that buy and destroy old cars; a cash-for-gas-engines scheme would make more sense by lowering costs and conserving the many car bodies that still work fine.) 
This project might have seemed quixotic a few years ago, but now it fits the times perfectly. 
It’s modest at a time when the world is in recession. 
It’s energy- and environmentally- friendly at a time when concerns about global warming are growing. 
And it’s distributed, at a time when the world is skeptical of leaders’ promises and people are realizing they have to do things for themselves. 
If you want to start an electric engine company, learn how to retrofit a gasoline engine, or simply figure out what you could do with your own car, go to www.ecars-now.org . 
There may not yet be a ready-made solution for you unless you live in Finland, but that’s just the point: you can start a local version. 
The Right Way to Rebuild Georgia 
NEW YORK – At the recent donors’ meeting on Georgia, aid pledges rolled in, totaling $4.5 billion – about $1,000 per citizen of Georgia. 
That’s the good news. 
The bad news is that the meeting was restricted to donors and Georgia’s government, with Transparency International criticizing its opaque decision-making process. 
Lack of transparency and accountability in how money is spent in wars, and in the rebuilding that takes place after them, no longer play well with taxpayers. 
In light of increasing global demand for aid and falling supply (down 12% over the last two years), its effective and transparent use is becoming more imperative. 
And governments that are not accountable to their citizens will most likely fail in this regard. 
Before these “pledges” become “commitments,” donors should carefully examine Georgia’s economic development strategy and assess its plans for humanitarian and reconstruction aid. 
They should ask whether aid for Georgia contributes to peace and stability or, on the contrary, whether it will impede a political solution to the conflict and keep investors away. 
Russia’s recent recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as separate republics, despite their de facto autonomous status within Georgia since the early 1990’s, will make it more difficult to find solutions to the problems of internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, and the resident population in the conflict zones. 
But reintegration of conflict-ridden groups into productive activities is a sine qua non for political, economic, and social stability. 
The UN reckons that countries that fail in this endeavor have an even chance of reverting to conflict. 
So, has Georgia’s development model been conducive to dynamic and inclusive growth, that is, growth that leads to productive investment, innovative practices, and widespread job creation? 
To be sure, the International Monetary Fund and United States officials have recognized Georgia’s unquestionable success in adopting sound macroeconomic policies and reforms to improve the business climate. 
Foreign investors have responded by pouring resources into the country. 
With capital inflows amounting to 20% of GDP in the years before the war, annual economic growth jumped to over 12% in 2007, with the country experiencing almost 40% growth since 2003. 
But rapid growth is not enough. 
Georgia has failed to create the jobs, dynamism, and inclusion that are necessary for a peaceful society. 
Despite some recent diversification, investment flows have been heavily tilted to construction of oil and gas pipelines and other large international projects. 
Moreover, military expenditure has increased from 1% to 7% of GDP since 2003, drawing resources away from human development into unproductive investment. 
Unemployment is high, income disparities have worsened, and corruption remains widespread, notwithstanding important improvements in recent years. 
Despite official statistics that place less than a third of the population below the poverty line, experts reckon that roughly half the population is trapped in poverty, amid a large urban-rural gap. 
The challenge for Georgia is to find a solution to the IDPs by rehabilitating infrastructure, housing, and other services, and by facilitating job creation so that the conflict-affected population’s living conditions can improve. 
The UN High Commission for Refugees forecasts that 73,000 of the roughly 127,000 IDPs created by the South Ossetian crisis will probably return to their place of origin by early winter. Given 220,000 IPDs from previous conflicts in the 1990’s now face fading prospects for a return to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia’s authorities must find a viable and permanent solution for roughly 6% of the population. 
Moreover, capital flows, upon which Georgia is highly dependent, have been interrupted since the conflict started. 
Without a solution to the IPD problem, efforts to strengthen political stability and security will fail. And, in the absence of stability and security, the objective of the IMF’s $750 million stand-by arrangement to cover the “temporary external financing gap” and to sustain “the confidence of markets and investors” will not be met. 
The challenge now is to redesign Georgia’s aid package to focus primarily on the provision of “reconstruction aid” that promotes investment and employment. 
While “humanitarian aid” cannot be neglected, it should be recognized that such aid promotes consumption rather than investment, creating price distortions and work disincentives. 
Georgia must be weaned from humanitarian aid as soon as the situation allows it. 
Reconstruction aid to improve infrastructure, promote start-up companies, and reactivate micro- and small enterprises, services, mining, and other sectors, and to improve agricultural yields and irrigation, should start right away and should be the main focus of international aid commitments. 
Laissez-faire will not do it. 
Georgia’s government and donors should consider using aid to provide subsidies to private enterprises to encourage and lower the cost of employing IDPs. 
Without inclusive and dynamic growth, sustainable peace will remain elusive, and, in the current environment of higher scrutiny and significant competing needs, donors will be hard pressed to justify committing the large financial aid package that they have pledged. 
The Rights of Apes – and Humans 
MELBOURNE – On June 25, in a historic vote, the Spanish parliament’s Commission for the Environment, Agriculture, and Fisheries declared its support for The Great Ape Project, a proposal to grant rights to life, liberty, and protection from torture to our closest nonhuman relatives: chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans. 
Other countries, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom, have taken steps to protect great apes from harmful experimentation, but no national parliament has declared that any animal could be a person with rights. 
The resolution, which the full parliament is expected to adopt, directs the Spanish government to promote a similar European Union-wide declaration. 
It also calls on the government to adopt, within a year, legislation to prohibit potentially harmful experiments on great apes that are not in their interests. 
Keeping great apes in captivity will be allowed for purposes of conservation only, and then under optimal conditions for the apes. 
Moreover, it recommends that Spain take steps in international forums and organizations to ensure that great apes are protected from maltreatment, slavery, torture, being killed, and being made extinct. 
Paola Cavalieri and I founded The Great Ape Project in 1993 to break down the barriers between human and nonhuman animals. 
Researchers like Jane Goodall, Diane Fossey, and Birute Galdikas have shown that great apes are thinking, self-aware beings, with rich emotional lives, and thereby prepared the ground for extending basic rights to them. 
If we regard human rights as something possessed by all human beings, no matter how limited their intellectual or emotional capacities may be, how can we deny similar rights to great apes, who clearly surpass some human beings in their rationality, self-awareness, and emotional bonds with others? 
To do so would be to display a prejudice against other beings merely because they are not members of our species – a prejudice we call speciesism, to highlight its resemblance to racism. 
The Great Ape Project seeks to change the way we think about great apes, and ultimately, about animals in general. 
The Spanish resolution marks the first official acceptance of that view. 
The use of the term “slavery” in relation to something that it is wrong to do to animals is especially significant, for until now it has been assumed that animals are rightly our slaves, to use as we wish, whether to pull our carts, be models of human diseases for research, or produce eggs, milk, or flesh for us to eat. 
Recognition by a government that it can be wrong to enslave animals is a significant breach in the wall of exclusive moral significance we have built around our own species. 
While Spanish parliamentarians were sympathetically considering the rights of animals, however, in Austria ten leaders of lawful animal-welfare organizations were beginning their fifth week in prison. 
At dawn on May 21, police burst into 23 separate locations, roused people from their beds, put guns to their heads, and forced one leader of an animal-welfare organization to stand in a public place in his underwear for two hours. 
They seized computers and files, disabling the animal-rights movement as it was on the eve of launching a new initiative to enshrine the protection of animals in the Austrian constitution. 
The ten arrested leaders are being held without charges or specific allegations made against them, under a law aimed at members of criminal organizations such as the mafia. 
The police have presented no evidence that any of those arrested were involved in violence. 
Yet a court has now remanded all ten to be held in prison until September. 
After 17 days in prison, three people were accused of threatening a press officer for a fashion store by hindering her from driving away. 
Another, Martin Balluch, has been given a 1,500-page police file to justify his arrest. 
In the file, his name is mentioned only three times, all in connection with interviews he gave to the media or articles he wrote. 
Ironically, Balluch, a brilliant man with doctorates in both physics and philosophy, is one of the foremost spokespersons in the worldwide animal-rights movement for pursuing the nonviolent, democratic road to reform. 
In an essay he wrote for In Defense of Animals , a book I edited that appeared in 2006, he wrote, “No realistic level of guerilla attacks of the kind carried out by the Animal Liberation Front could have hurt the battery farming industry as much as the new Austrian law does.” 
In recent years, Austrian animal-welfare organizations have been remarkably successful in persuading voters and legislators to support laws phasing out cages for egg-laying hens, cages for raising rabbits for meat, and raising animals for fur. 
As Balluch writes: “A law banning a whole industry does far more economic damage to the animal abuse industry than anything else the animal movement could do.” 
The police persecution of the animal movement appears to be an attempt by the conservative party, which controls the Ministry of the Interior, and its animal industry supporters to strike back at a legitimate, peaceful challenge to the way we treat animals. 
The Rise and Fall of Meritocracy 
Meritocracy: the word sounds nothing but good. 
It means rule by those who have merit. 
Such merit is usually understood to be academic achievement, a combination of talent and training. 
This is measured by academic degrees, which in turn are graded on merit: A, B, C, D, or First, Upper Second, Lower Second, Third. 
Who would not wish to live in a meritocracy? 
It is certainly preferable to a plutocracy, in which wealth determines status, or a gerontocracy, in which age leads one to the top, or even an aristocracy, in which what counts are inherited titles and properties. 
So meritocracy seems preferable, at least at first sight. 
But, on closer inspection, things are not so simple. 
For many, France has long been the epitome of meritocracy. 
Most of those in the top reaches of not only the civil service and the judiciary, but also politics, business, and academia used to be graduates of the famous grandes écoles . 
Many then went through the rigorous training to become inspecteurs de finance , senior state officials. 
Yet the French elites today are increasingly held in suspicion, and even reviled, by part of the population. 
Certainly, French leaders are not immune to corruption. 
The uneasy relationship of money and politics has given rise to several high-profile scandals in recent years. 
It is no longer clear that France’s highly educated leaders are better able to run the country’s affairs more efficiently and more honestly than others. 
Japan’s meritocratically selected bureaucracy, too, faces much the same public opprobrium. 
Indeed, the bureaucracy itself is often blamed for the country’s rigidity and ongoing stagnation. 
In Britain, a government heading for its third term in office has said more than once that it wants the country to be “meritocratic.” 
Chancellor Gordon Brown, Tony Blair’s heir apparent, is particularly eager to go down that road. 
Yet it was a British social scientist (and Labour Party politician), Michael Young, who forty years ago wrote a much debated book entitled The Rise of the Meritocracy . 
His was not a description of the road to the promised land, but a dystopian vision of almost Orwellian dimensions. 
Meritocracy was Young’s “1984.” 
Two central questions raised by Young remain topical today. 
First, if academic achievement is the entry ticket to power and status, what about the rest? 
What about those who do not make it to university? 
How do the other 50% fare in a meritocratic world? 
They are, Young argued, confined, even condemned to lower-level jobs, with no chance to rise to eminence, or even to a comfortable position of responsibility. 
According to Young, those who have at least some talent will form a “pioneer corps” of plumbers and builders and other skilled workers. 
Those who do not even make that grade will remain in a “home help corps” of unskilled laborers. 
Young’s bleak picture bears an eerie resemblance to today’s world. 
The new underclass is the other side of the meritocratic elite. 
Immigrants, in particular, do not enjoy the equality of opportunity that the word “merit” suggests. 
Indeed, nowadays meritocracy seems to be simply another version of the inequality that characterises all societies. 
It may in fact be a particularly cruel form of inequality, as those who do not succeed cannot argue that they were unlucky or kept down by those in power. 
Instead, they must conclude that they personally failed, and that no amount of effort can save them. 
To this must be added another feature that Young described: meritocracy means only that another ruling group closes the gates behind it once it has achieved its status. 
Those who made it on “merit” now want to have everything else as well – not just power and money, but also the opportunity to determine who gets in and who stays out. 
Sooner or later, Young argued, meritocratic elites cease to be open; they see to it that their children have a better chance than the offspring of the “pioneer corps” or “home help corps.” 
Like all elites before them, they become firmly established – and use all available means to keep it that way. 
There is no need to follow Young’s argument all the way to the eventual revolution. 
There is a need, however, for a healthy skepticism towards the claims of a meritocracy based on academic achievement alone. 
Such a society is not the answer to all our prayers for decency and fairness, or even for sensible and good decisions. 
It is far better to remember that when it comes to leadership, many qualities other than a first-class degree come into play. 
As far as institutions are concerned, we should not allow any one criterion to determine who gets to the top and who does not. 
Diversity is a better guarantee of openness than even merit, and openness is the real hallmark of a liberal order. 
The Rise and Fall of Putinism 
MOSCOW – How did “Putinism” – that distinctively Russian blend of authoritarian politics and dirigiste economics – happen? 
And, now that it has, how can Russians move beyond it, to realize the rights and liberties promised to them in the country’s constitution? 
An active Russian civil society, which seemed to appear out of nowhere in Mikhail Gorbachev’s Soviet Union of 1989-1990 after the long Soviet hibernation, receded far too quickly. 
The astounding difficulty of everyday survival following the USSR’s collapse trapped most Russians into focusing on their families’ most urgent needs. 
Civic apathy set in. 
So Vladimir Putin came to power at a very convenient moment for any ruler – when the people are quiescent. 
Cunningly, Putin then strapped this apathy to the first shoots of post-Soviet economic growth in order to conclude a new social contract: he would raise living standards in exchange for ordinary Russians’ acceptance of severe limits on their constitutional rights and liberties. 
Until recently, both sides adhered to this tacit contract. 
But, with the global financial crisis, the Kremlin stopped meeting its side of the bargain. 
Thus, a new social contract is needed, especially as a new, post-Soviet generation of Russians has entered political life – a generation that has not been poisoned by the fear that decades of state terror in the USSR implanted in their forebears. 
Putin and his entourage “tightened the screws” on Russia’s people over the past decade, and faced almost no resistance to their claims to unchecked power. Now, from the entire spectrum of civil and political rights enumerated in Russia’s Constitution, we Russians have only one right remaining: the right to leave and return to the country freely. 
All other rights have been lost or substantially weakened. 
But Russian citizens, especially younger ones, are beginning to realize what they have lost. 
By the same token, the post-Soviet generation has a very different idea of a decent standard of living than their parents had, and hence their aspirations are much higher. 
Many have traveled abroad, and all have seen foreign films, from which they have learned that people of their social status in the West have a far more comfortable life than they do. 
The majority of Soviet people did not have a car or a country house or even a separate apartment. 
Now the young feel deprived if they can’t have all of that. 
At first, people did not think of civil rights as they strove for such previously unknown comforts. 
They relied on the Kremlin to set the conditions that would give them new opportunities. 
Now, they are gradually coming to understand that the government has failed them. 
A struggle for the restitution of constitutional rights in Russia first became noticeable in 2009. 
At Triumph Square in Moscow, protestors have consistently demanded that Article 31, which guarantees the right to peaceful assembly, be respected. 
Movement-31, an umbrella grouping of like-minded protestors, has spread rapidly, staging simultaneous demonstrations in Moscow and 48 other cities two months ago in support of the right to free assembly. 
There have been simultaneous protests in the past, but usually against increases in rent or utility charges. 
One can understand why the demand to comply with Article 31 has gained popular support. 
For ordinary citizens, who have neither access to the media nor personal contacts with the authorities, protests are an opportunity to inform officials of their demands, requests, and suggestions. 
There are also other signs of awakening civic engagement, which are particularly evident in Internet discussions, which the Kremlin cannot control in the same way that it does other Russian media. 
Citizens have started to use the Internet for self-organization, for example, to generate simultaneous “flash mobs,” as well as protests by automobile owners, in different cities. 
Most recently, the Internet has become a means of public control over civil-rights violations by the authorities, as images taken with mobile phones become available instantaneously to all. 
The authorities have to reckon with the fallout, punishing officials who have come into the spotlight this way. 
Russia’s federal government and regional authorities are clearly alarmed by this rapidly growing civic activism. 
But, despite changed conditions, they respond with the same old methods – suppression, intimidation, and misinformation. 
And, with elections to the State Duma due in December 2011, followed by the presidential election in March 2012, officials are particularly concerned by an upsurge of civic activism. 
It is not hard to see why. 
Over the past decade, the electoral system was “improved” in such a way that no outcome can lead to a change in the federal government. 
That leaves street demonstrations and other forms of civic activism as the only way to challenge Putinism’s standard-bearers. 
Indeed, given state control of the mainstream media, such activism may be the only way to learn what citizens really think about their rulers. 
The Rise of Chinese “Sea Power” 
In an age of missiles and terrorist threats, many people think that “sea power” is a word and concept from the past. 
Not in China. 
Indeed, China is increasingly emphasizing its naval and maritime interests: economic development, territorial management, energy and food security as well as trade. 
A navy sufficient to promote such activities is being rapidly developed and purchased from abroad (mostly from Russia, the EU when possible). 
Many of China’s neighbors are alarmed. 
The United States Defense Department views China’s goal as being to build a series of military and diplomatic strategic bases – a so-called “string of pearls” – along the major sea lanes from the South China Sea to the oil rich Middle East. 
China seeks not only to secure its energy supplies, but to achieve broader security goals. 
For example, the Gwadar military port, which China is constructing in southwest Pakistan, is strategically placed to guard the throat of the Persian Gulf, with electronic eavesdropping posts to monitor ships -- including war ships -- moving through the Strait of Hormuz and the Arabian Sea. 
Similarly, China is building container port facilities at Chittagong in Bangladesh for its naval and merchant fleets, as well as more naval bases and electronic intelligence gathering facilities on islands owned by Myanmar in the Gulf of Bengal. 
Indeed, China’s ties with Myanmar’s military dictators look set to turn into a de facto military alliance. 
In nearby Thailand, China has invested $20 billion in a plan to build a canal across the Kra Isthmus to connect the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Siam, thereby providing an alternate oil import route that avoids the Strait of Malacca. 
In the South China Sea, China is developing systems to allow large-scale deployment of naval and air force units by fortifying bases on Hai Nan Island and the southern Chinese coastal area. 
On the Spratley and Paracel islands -- seized from Vietnam and the Philippines respectively -- China is building port facilities to moor large surface ships and runways large enough to handle long-range bombers. 
In effect, China is in the process of building a group of literally unsinkable aircraft carriers in the middle of the South China Sea. 
Why is China, usually considered a “continental power,” engaging in this maritime expansion? 
China dominated Asia in terms of “sea power” until the seventeenth century. 
Indeed, during the Ming Dynasty (1368—1644), Admiral Zheng He’s “Great Navy” was the world’s most powerful. 
But for the last three centuries, China has had no global maritime strategy, nor has it possessed – or sought to possess – naval forces capable of supporting such a strategy. 
Ironically, China’s current maritime strategy has its roots in the US, the nation that China appears to perceive as its key strategic rival, namely in the “sea power” theory developed by Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan at the end of the nineteenth century. 
In The Influence of Sea Power upon History, published in 1890, Mahan argued that maritime power and economic development were deeply intertwined. 
Only the ability to protect trade and project power by sea could assure the vitality of this nexus. 
Mahan identified the conditions that determine “sea power”: 
· geographical position and environment; 
· territorial capacity, specifically coastline 
· population; 
· character of people attuned to maritime expeditions; 
· character of government eager to ebrace “sea power”. 
These conditions applied to the US of Mahan’s time, and they surely apply to China today. 
China is already the world’s third largest trading nation and rapidly developing its port capacities to manage an ever-increasing volume of trade. 
Its ship tonnage (excluding fleets that sail under flags of convenience) is the fourth largest in the world. 
Rapid expansion of ship tonnage is part of China’s current Five-Year, and by 2010 its shipbuilding capabilities will likely rival those of Japan and Korea. 
However, unlike the US and Britain in the past, China today must turn to overseas bases rather than colonization to enhance its “sea power” – hence its “string of pearls.” 
Still, China is transforming its coastal navy into an ocean-going navy at a pace far quicker than most experts reckoned possible. 
By 2010, China is expected to have 70 of the most modern surface vessels, several modern strategic nuclear submarines, and several tens of modernized attack submarines, exceeding the modern forces of both Taiwan’s navy and even Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force, at least in quantitative terms. 
Moreover, China plans to improve and expand its capabilities for assault landing and joint logistical support, both of which used to be weak points. 
This will provide China with necessary capabilities to invade, should China’s rulers wish, Japan’s most remote islands, including the disputed Senkaku Islands, as well as Taiwan. 
If China’s naval growth continues at its current pace, it may have the world’s largest naval force by 2020. 
All of Asia must wake up to the arrival of Chinese-style aggressive “sea power.” 
Japan, in particular, must reformulate its national maritime strategy with this in mind. 
The Rise of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis 
BALTIMORE -- Tuberculosis, one of the most deadly infectious diseases, is back with a vengeance, especially in Africa. 
Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a difficult to treat strain of TB which, attacks where health systems are historically weak, especially in areas of high HIV prevalence. 
Failure to contain local outbreaks, develop tools and strategies for identifying and treating XDR-TB, and invest in longer-term improvements in TB control could transform our pharmacological magic bullets for TB into blanks. 
The development of TB chemotherapy from the 1940’s through the 1970’s transformed the once deadly “white plague” into a curable disease. 
But TB treatment has been shadowed by the specter of drug resistance since the dawn of the antibiotic era. 
Fifteen years ago, an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in New York City induced near panic, before a massive infusion of funds into the public health infrastructure turned the tide in the United States, and public interest waned. 
However, the problem of drug resistance has persisted, and efforts to contain it globally have not been sufficient. 
Enter XDR-TB. 
The World Health Organization estimates that there were 425,000 new MDR-TB cases in 2004, with China, India, and Russia accounting for just over 60%. 
But it was an outbreak of XDR-TB in HIV-infected people in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, that turned the global spotlight on issues of extensively drug-resistant organisms. 
In a study at the Church of Scotland Hospital in rural KwaZulu-Natal province of 535 patients who had confirmed tuberculosis, 221 had MDR-TB, a level 10 times greater than in the province as a whole. More alarmingly, 53 of the 221 had a strain that was also resistant to the two most clinically useful classes of second-line TB drugs. 
Fifty-two of the 53 died in a median of just 16 days from the time of sputum collection. 
Molecular typing of the isolates indicated that 85% were clonally related, implying epidemic transmission of XDR strains, most likely in HIV clinics and hospital wards. 
How did this localized outbreak of XDR-TB emerge? 
Are similar localized outbreaks going unrecognized elsewhere? 
More importantly, can XDR-TB be controlled? 
Resistance to anti-TB drugs arises from selection of naturally occurring mutants with innate resistance to drugs. 
Poor adherence to the therapeutic regimen, improper prescribing by clinicians, and drug interactions or malabsorption can result in partial suppression of bacterial growth and the emergence of resistant organisms. 
Once this resistance develops, treatment is compromised, further resistance can evolve, and resistant organisms can be transmitted to other people, leading to primary drug resistance that may fail to respond to standard therapy. 
Effective treatment and cure of MDR-TB requires prolonged use (typically two years) of a combination of drugs, including second-line drugs that for the most part are less potent than first-line agents, more toxic, or both. 
For the past six years, a global effort (called DOTS-Plus) to treat people with MDR-TB under strict conditions has been underway, reaching thousands with previously untreatable TB. 
An unfortunate consequence of treating MDR-TB with second-line drugs, however, is the inevitable emergence of further drug resistance. 
If the same factors that produce MDR-TB remain in play, then MDR-TB becomes XDR-TB. 
There is no magic bullet for controlling XDR-TB. 
Addressing drug-resistant TB cannot be divorced from overall TB control efforts. 
Moreover, TB control strategies targeted at populations with high HIV burdens are critically important. 
Such strategies include widespread implementation of TB preventive therapy with isoniazid – which is vastly underused, despite its low cost and known efficacy – and improved detection in HIV-infected people, many of whom die of TB without a diagnosis. 
Attention must also be paid to infection control in hospitals and clinics: many of the XDR-TB cases in South Africa were acquired in HIV clinics or wards. 
Access to HIV care, including ART, is also urgently needed, and reducing HIV incidence would substantially reduce the TB burden over the longer term. 
Moreover, the capacity for prompt, accurate laboratory-based diagnosis of TB and drug resistance must be strengthened. 
This will require infrastructure development, as well as reliable systems for procuring supplies, maintaining equipment, and training and retaining personnel. 
Enhanced surveillance also is needed. 
The Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance has collected information on prevalence, patterns, and trends of drug resistance since 1994, focusing on resistance to first-line drugs and contributing much to our understanding of MDR-TB. 
But surveillance for XDR-TB has been more limited, as drug susceptibility testing for second-line drugs is not well-standardized and for some drugs is poorly reproducible, while few countries perform such testing within the context of their national TB programs. 
Priorities for XDR-TB surveillance include facilitating access to reliable susceptibility testing to second-line drugs and incorporating this, together with information about HIV testing, into existing TB surveillance activities. 
The Rise of Liberal Japan 
Most people looking at the rise of Asian power focus on China and India. 
They often forget that Japan’s $5 trillion economy is the second largest in the world – more than China and India combined – with a per capita income that is ten times that of China. 
In addition, Japan spends $40 billion annually on defense, and has one of the top five military forces in the world. 
China’s economy is growing more rapidly, and its total size will probably overtake Japan’s in a decade or two, but any serious analysis of power in East Asia must include Japan as a major factor. 
Japan has played a unique role in world history. 
It was the first Asian country to encounter the forces of globalization, master them, and then make them serve its own interests. 
Moreover, Japan has reinvented itself twice. 
During the Meiji restoration of the nineteenth century, Japan scoured the world for ideas and technologies that allowed it to defeat a European great power in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. 
Unfortunately, Japan moved onto militaristic imperialism in the 1930’s, which eventually led to its surrender and occupation in 1945. 
But in the post-World War II period, Japan again used the forces of globalization to reinvent itself as an economic superpower that became the envy of the world. 
As Kenneth Pyle argues in his interesting new book Japan Rising , these reinventions were responses to external shifts in world politics. 
Now, with the growth of Chinese power, one of the great questions for this century will be how Japan responds. 
The Japanese are currently debating their role in global politics. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has taken a more nationalistic stance than most of his predecessors, and his Liberal Democratic Party is committed to revising Article 9 of the constitution, which limits Japan’s forces to self-defense. 
Public opinion is divided on the issue, and polls vary according to how the questions are asked. 
Nonetheless, many astute analysts believe that the constitution will be amended within the coming decade. 
While Abe wisely visited China and smoothed over relations ruffled by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, who repeatedly visited the Yasukuni Shrine (where 14 class A war criminals from WWII are interred), many people are uncertain about his long-term vision. 
As one well-known Japanese intellectual told me during a recent visit to Tokyo, “I can accept constitutional revision in the long run, but not while Abe is prime minister.” 
In May, Asahi Shimbun , a major newspaper known for its left/liberal inclination, proposed an alternative vision for twenty-first century Japan in a series of 21 editorials. 
Asahi rejected the idea of revising Article 9, and proposed instead that the Japanese Diet legalize the role of the Self-Defense Forces. 
The editorials accepted the treaty with the United States that serves as a basis for Japanese security, but rejected the idea that Japan has a right to collective self-defense. 
Interestingly, one of the reasons given for retaining Article 9 was that it would better enable Japan to resist American pressures to engage in military “coalitions of the willing” far from Japan’s shores. 
Asahi worried about the precedent set when Koizumi sent Japan’s Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, albeit in a non-combatant role, to please US President George W. Bush. 
Conservative voices argue just the opposite – that abolishing Article 9 is important for exactly such reasons. 
The alternative vision that Asahi offered was for Japan to become a world power as a provider and coordinator of global public goods from which all peoples can benefit and none can be excluded, such as freedom of the seas or a stable international monetary system. 
This would be a way for Japan to escape its reputation for insularity, avoid the mistakes of its military history, improve its relations with Asian neighbors who still remember the 1930’s, and increase Japan’s “soft” or attractive power. 
More specifically, Asahi urged that Japan take the lead on managing global climate change by building on its record of successful innovation in energy conservation following the oil shocks of the 1970’s. 
In an interesting conjunction of events, shortly after the Asahi editorial was published, Abe committed Japan to halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to helping developing countries to join in a new post-Kyoto protocol climate regime. 
The liberal vision also includes a major Japanese role in stabilizing globalization by supporting international trade and monetary institutions; alleviating global poverty by increasing overseas development assistance, particularly to Africa; helping to develop instruments for conflict prevention and management such as the United Nations Peace-building Commission; and participating in UN peacekeeping operations. 
As for the rise of Japan’s giant neighbor, the liberal vision urges patience and tenacity in encouraging China to move toward greater transparency, the rule of law, and democratization, as well as adhering to international rules governing world order. 
While maintaining its alliance with America, “Japan must always bear in mind the strategic importance of stabilizing its relationship with China.” By helping China in the areas of energy and environmental issues, perhaps “the scars left from the war with Japan may begin to heal.” 
Japan has become more willing to use its power, and more aware of changes in the external balance of power. 
It is rising, but how? 
As one Japanese liberal commented to me, “this is our third response to globalization. 
What can we contribute this time?” 
The Rise of Mid-Level Powers 
The security environment since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States has clearly demonstrated the limits of the United Nations, or even the US as the world’s sole military superpower, to maintain international security. 
However, like-minded mid-level powers with similar intentions could complement what the UN or the US lacks, effectively generating sufficient clout to stabilize the global security environment. 
Japan, Australia, Germany, or Canada might be just such powers. 
They share common values as free and democratic countries. 
Moreover, they are non-nuclear powers with no permanent seats in the UN Security Council. 
All are long time allies of the US. 
In fact, over recent years these countries have already had many opportunities to demonstrate their ability and willingness to contribute to international security if called for, for they all also share a recognition that global stability directly serves their own national interests. 
Nevertheless, subtle differences among these countries may influence their bilateral cooperation or coordination with the UN or the US. 
As a result, they must compliment each other’s advantages, characteristics, and interests in order to optimize their role in promoting international security. 
For many years, Japan has been taking very cautious steps into this area, but substantial changes have occurred recently. 
In March 2007, Japan agreed to enter a “semi-alliance” with Australia, and issued a “Joint Communiqué on Japan-Australia Security Cooperation.” 
In early June, the two countries’ defense and foreign ministers held the first regular security meeting (the so-called “2+2 meeting”) in Tokyo, agreeing to promote defense cooperation in various fields, including international security. 
Under Japan’s last two prime ministers, Japan has steadily been making practical contributions to the stabilization of the international security environment as a way to benefit its national and international interests. 
Japan is thus helping to create conditions to allow mid-level powers to act jointly and effectively to provide an essential international “public good.” 
Such practical proposals address key global issues, including international terrorism, strengthening of mechanisms for arms control, arms reduction, and non-proliferation, efforts to contain attempts by North Korea and Iran to develop nuclear weapons, encouraging transparency in China’s military, restraining Russia’s imperial ambitions, and building a global ballistic missile defense network against missiles that could be launched by rogue regimes. 
However, efforts to promote this kind of cooperation should not be confined to these mid-level powers. 
There are many other potential mid-level democratic countries that should take part. 
Various approaches may be available for building a coalition of such powers, including the use of the UN and seeking to influence US foreign policy. 
To advance such efforts, it may be necessary for mid-level powers such as Japan, Canada, Australia, and Germany to strengthen ties with other like-minded mid-level countries that possess nuclear weapons and hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council, such as the United Kingdom and France, or with smaller nuclear powers without permanent Security Council seats, such as India. 
Once such a coalition gains a sure footing, the next step would be to participate actively in the negotiation of major security issues, such as international arms control, arms reduction, and non-proliferation, while encouraging the involvement of China and Russia. 
The goal should be to build and exercise influence within the international community to the point that the coalition becomes tantamount to a permanent “sixth” member of the Security Council. 
China’s E-Tail Revolution 
SHANGHAI – When you think about centers of technological innovation, Silicon Valley, Seattle, and Seoul are probably the first places that come to mind. 
After all, they are the homes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung – companies whose innovations transform the way other sectors, from financial services to telecoms and media, do business. 
Now, however, the rise of “e-tail” (consumer-facing e-commerce) in China is enabling Hangzhou – the base of Alibaba, China’s largest online retailer – to join their ranks. 
Indeed, on April 29, Alibaba signaled its ambitions by buying an 18% stake in Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. 
And, as with technology hubs elsewhere, innovations born in Hangzhou are determining the development path of related industries. 
China’s e-tail market is the world’s second largest (after that of the United States), with an estimated $210 billion in revenue last year. 
Since 2003, the market has posted a compound annual growth rate of over 110%. 
By 2020, China’s e-tail market could be as large as today’s markets in the US, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France combined. 
Despite a broadband penetration rate of only 30%, e-tail commanded 5-6% of total retail sales in China in 2012, on par with the US. 
And the sector is already profitable: Chinese e-tailers are logging margins of 8-10% of earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization, which is slightly larger than the average margin for physical retailers. 
Two features of Chinese e-commerce stand out. 
First, roughly 90% of Chinese e-tail is conducted on ad-funded virtual marketplaces. On these platforms – which resemble eBay and Amazon Marketplace – manufacturers, retailers, and individuals offer products and services to consumers through online storefronts. 
By contrast, in the US, Europe, and Japan, roughly 70% of the market is composed of e-tailers running their own Web sites, whether online-only merchants like Amazon or traditional brick-and-mortar retailers such as Carrefour, Dixons, and Walmart. 
Moreover, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, online purchases in China do not simply replace offline purchases. Rather, e-tail supports incremental consumption: $1 of online consumption seems to generate roughly $0.40 of additional sales. 
And incremental spending as a share of total spending is even higher in China’s less-developed cities, where a shortage of brick-and-mortar retailers means that online shopping provides access to otherwise unavailable products and brands. 
Mass consumption in China and other emerging economies is coming of age in the Internet era. 
Given that industry structures are still developing in many of these countries, e-tail is set to shape not only the retail landscape, but also the manufacturing and financial-services industries – and even the urban landscape itself. 
In most countries, the retail sector has typically developed in three stages: first, local or regional players dominate, before a smaller number of national companies takes over, with e-tailers ultimately challenging traditional businesses. 
But China lacks national leaders, with the top five Chinese retailers in different product categories commanding less than 20% of the market, compared to up to 60% in the US. 
And establishing a strong physical presence throughout the country will be time-consuming and expensive. 
By contrast, Alibaba (which owns marketplaces such as Taobao) and 360buy.com (which focuses on electronics) rank among China’s top ten retailers, and already provide national coverage through the reach of express delivery companies. 
As a result, China’s retail sector seems more likely to follow a two-stage development path, with e-tailers emerging as the major national players. 
The ability afforded by online marketplaces to new players to attain national – and international – prominence without massive upfront investment will profoundly affect how both retailers and manufacturers approach new consumer markets. 
The Japanese retailer Uniqlo, for example, used such marketplaces to expand into China in 2009. 
Likewise, by removing some of the benefits of scale and specialization that characterize the consumer-goods industry elsewhere, e-tail enables new manufacturers to join the market, selling goods like apparel and cosmetics directly from workshops and factories to consumers. 
Such businesses are also leveraging their broad access and widely recognized brands to expand their role in the financial-services sector. 
Finally, e-tail could shape China’s urban development and transform leisure activities. 
Urban centers worldwide revolve around shops, whether on main street or at the mall, with many consumers viewing shopping as a leisure activity. China’s evolution will likely entail smaller main streets and malls, with large distribution centers near city limits. 
Citizens will spend more free time engaging in other activities, such as dining out. 
All of these changes could alter the use and pricing of real estate. 
Other emerging markets are likely to follow a similar course. 
Chinese e-tailers are already using their advantages in exporting products from the country’s factories to expand internationally. 
And enterprises in other countries are adopting a similar online business model. 
China may have largely missed the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century. 
But its approach to e-tail is poised to be one of the forces shaping the emerging-market Internet revolution of the twenty-first century. 
The Rise of Regionalism in Asia 
This week, America and Singapore ironed out the final stumbling blocks to a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA). 
Such pacts are spreading like wildfire across Asia. 
Until recently, most East Asian countries pursued non-discriminatory trade policies through unilateral liberalisation, the Asian/Pacific Economic Community, and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 
As the US/Singapore deal shows, discriminatory bilateral and regional initiatives are growing more popular. 
An East Asian economic bloc forming around either China and/or Japan now seems plausible. 
Will all this deal-making sideline the region in the WTO? 
East Asian countries have relatively liberal trade policies and are reasonably well integrated into the global economy. 
This, however, masks huge differences. 
Hong Kong and Singapore are free ports. 
South Korea and Taiwan liberalised substantially in recent years. 
Malaysia is fairly open but with significant protection, especially in services. 
Thai protectionism remains high. 
Indonesia and the Philippines are mired in political and economic instability. 
Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, all very poor, have higher levels of protection. 
Now consider the two regional engines, Japan and China. 
Japan's sclerotic domestic economy makes it incapable of exerting regional leadership. 
On trade policy it is defensive, especially in its addiction to agricultural protectionism. 
China presents a different picture. 
Its WTO commitments are the strongest of any developing country. 
China narrowed the trade policy gap with other developing countries, bringing average tariffs down to Southeast Asian and Latin American levels (about 10%) and establishing comparable openness to foreign direct investment (FDI). 
The upshot is that the emerging market policy environment is a lot more competitive, especially in terms of attracting FDI. 
Traces of the "new regionalism" can be found everywhere. 
Singapore pioneered this approach. 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is talking to several third countries. 
To date only a proposed ASEAN-China FTA has got off the starting blocks. 
Similar initiatives are afoot in Northeast Asia. 
Both political and economic factors lie behind this. 
China views FTAs as a means to exercise strategic leadership in the region. 
The economic motivations are mostly defensive. But with the WTO stuck in drift and deadlock over the past few years, there is a race to secure preferential access to the markets of the major powers, and to defuse trade tension by locking into strong bilateral and regional partnerships. 
Given today's trends, a loose East Asian trade bloc revolving around China (more likely than Japan) could emerge alongside US-led and EU-led blocs, all interlinked by a cross-regional patchwork of bilateral and "plurilateral" FTAs. 
This scenario is worrying if the WTO does not get out of its rut, because a world economy that has been sliced up regionally will be dominated by discrimination, knots of red tape, and power plays. 
In such a world, poor and weak countries would be losers. 
However, if the global trade framework institutionalised in the WTO advances, especially through multilateral, non-discriminatory liberalisation in the present Doha Round, the new regionalism will probably turn out to be benign. 
Ultimately, as a region highly dependent on trade with and inward investment from the rest of the world, FTAs are not enough for East Asia. 
The region will continue to have a long-term stake in a WTO that delivers freer trade worldwide, that is, multilaterally rather than bilaterally or regionally. 
The WTO is important to East Asia, but the reverse is also true. 
Of the twenty or so active developing and newly developed countries in the WTO, almost half come from the region. 
The Doha Round will not make sustained progress without the active participation of East Asia, on individual issues and across the board. 
Because of its economic and trade muscle, China is bound to play a more prominent role as the Doha round unfolds. 
There are early, positive signs that it is adopting a "Brazilian," as opposed to an "Indian," strategy within the WTO. 
It is not being negative or obstructionist in blocking the liberalization process on several fronts, which is India's historic manner of conducting global trade negotiations. 
This is the right approach for those in China's leadership who wish to extract maximum benefits from the WTO to bolster domestic reform. 
Korea is active and constructive in the WTO, except on agriculture. 
Taiwan is also set to play a constructive role--if mainland China lets it. 
The city states, Hong Kong and Singapore, have clear-sighted WTO policies, focusing on market access and strong rules. 
Malaysia and Thailand are also fairly active in the WTO, with a mix of free-market and protectionist positions. 
Indonesia and the Philippines are weaker, overwhelmed by policy incoherence and fire-fighting at home, and with insufficient capacity to deal with the WTO's burgeoning and increasingly complicated agenda. 
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are in the queue for WTO accession. 
The WTO is at a crossroads. 
It sorely needs to liberalize trade progressively. 
Strong US leadership is required to push the WTO in this direction while avoiding an EU-style future (regulatory overload) or a UN-style future (an irrelevant talking shop). 
This is more likely under a Bush administration with better open-market credentials and a more assertive foreign policy than any Democratic alternative. 
However, Robert Zoellick, President Bush's Trade Representative, needs allies. 
Many of them--including China--are to be found in East Asia. 
The New Economy of Fealty 
PRINCETON – Since the 2008 financial crisis, most industrial economies have avoided anything like the collapse that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930’s. 
But, despite large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus, they are not experiencing any dramatic economic rebound. 
Moreover, the pre-crisis trend of rising income and wealth inequality is continuing (in marked contrast to the post-Great Depression period, in which inequality declined). 
And survey data show a rapid decline in people’s satisfaction and confidence about the future. 
The explanation of the post-crisis malaise – and people’s perception of it – lies in the combination of economic uncertainty and the emergence of radically new forms of social interaction. Long-term structural shifts are fundamentally changing the nature of work, and thus of the way that we think of economic exchange. 
In the early twentieth century, a large share of even advanced economies’ populations was still employed in agriculture. 
That proportion subsequently fell sharply, and the same decline could later be seen in industrial employment. 
Since the late twentieth century, most employment growth has come in services, particularly personal services – a pattern that looks like a reversal of a previous historical trend. 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, upper-middle-class households had a substantial staff of cooks, maids, nannies, and cleaners. 
In the interwar years, these employees largely disappeared from the lives of all but the ultra-rich. 
The iconoclastic British historian A. J. P. Taylor quipped that laments about the decline of Britain were really generalized reflections of Oxford academics’ view of the “servant problem.” 
By the end of the twentieth century, however, many of these old service occupations were reappearing on a large scale, as dual-career households needed additional “help.” 
The employment of nannies, au pairs, babysitters, and day mothers reflected carefully differentiated approaches to the problem of looking after children. 
After child care, there followed hordes of private tutors, test coaches, and university admissions consultants. 
And, beyond childhood and adolescence, the need for specialized personal support only grew. 
Some of the new services would stretch the imagination of previous ages. 
Dating agencies have developed increasingly complex algorithms to sort out their clients’ romantic lives. 
Lawyers work out prenuptial contracts, and then the complexities of divorce negotiations. 
Design consultants choose our interiors and clothing. 
Personal trainers look after our fitness. 
Cosmeticians, skin-care specialists, and tattoo artists shape our appearance. 
Two of the largest areas of service-employment expansion have been education and health services. And yet this has not been a result of adding more teachers or doctors. 
Instead, a new division of labor has surrounded the classical providers of education and healing with more and more layers of administration. 
Doctors need experts to deal with insurance forms, negotiate with other doctors and pharmaceutical providers, and manage legal risks. 
Educational specialists fill every conceivable logistical and administrative gap, run sports and arts programs, guarantee diversity, and oversee technology transfer to the private sector. 
Indeed, a rapidly growing army of administrators is overrunning our universities. 
None of these new services can easily be standardized, or dealt with at long distances (as can some types of clerical legal and financial work). 
The caregivers and consultants need to be on location. 
And that raises a question of control. 
How can child-care providers be trusted? 
Cautious parents seek agents to select their employees and technology to monitor them as they work. So, to find out about the reputation of service providers, we need still more service providers: ratings and surveys and agents to tell us about agents. 
The new service economy extends market relations to areas of life in which, previously, informal assistance and guidance within family units prevailed. 
To the extent that employment and income in the new services can be easily recorded, this change implies an increase in measurable economic wealth and output, because unpaid household services are ignored in GDP calculations. 
Experts might thus interpret the macroeconomic consequences as largely positive. 
But the element of personal dependence is a throwback to the preindustrial world. 
The zenith of the old service economy was the court of Louis XIV, where specialist courtiers attended to the Sun King’s every need, even the most intimate (there was a Groom of the King’s Close Stool). In that pre-modern world, private life was extraordinarily public, whereas the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dramatically expanded the realm of individual privacy and self-definition. 
Today’s new service economy is driven by the resulting uncertainty over identity. 
We need advice on every aspect of life, provided in a complex world by people whom we think to be experts in ever-narrower and more specialized fields. 
We can easily monitor that advice and subject it to statistical testing: are our children doing better on tests? 
Are we more fit? 
Are we dating more people who share our perceived interests? 
Paradoxically, the new technological possibilities are also eliminating privacy. 
We are moving back to the Sun King’s world, in which everything personal is known, rumored, or whispered. 
But now, with electronic surveillance, personal dependence has never been more extreme, more humiliating, and more depressing. 
This might explain some of the public dissatisfaction captured in so many surveys, even when economic conditions are not dire. 
Subjectively, modern growth feels problematic, and perhaps even immoral. 
The Rise of the Beijing Consensus 
BRUSSELS – President Barack Obama’s first appearances outside North America – in London, Strasbourg, Prague, and Istanbul – galvanized world attention. 
But what that trip singularly failed to do was paper over a startling fact: the “Washington Consensus” about how the global economy should be run is now a thing of the past. 
The question now is what is likely to replace it. 
Although China is often said to lack “soft power,” many of its ideas on economics and governance are coming into ascendance. 
Indeed, in pursuit of national economic stability, the Obama administration is clearly moving towards the kind of government intervention that China has been promoting over the past two decades. 
In this model, the government, while continuing to benefit from the international market, retains power over the economy’s “commanding heights” through strict control over the financial sector, restrictive government procurement policies, guidance for research and development in the energy sector, and selective curbs on imports of goods and services. 
All these factors are not only part of China’s economic rescue package, but of Obama’s stimulus plan as well. 
China is clearly pleased to see that the United States is now also placing cool calculation of its national interests at the forefront of its foreign policy. “In delivering a better life for people on the ground, one should be more concerned with substance than with form,” Obama stated in an interview just before his inauguration. 
Rather than obsessing about elections, the US now seeks to build pragmatic alliances to buttress its economic needs. 
This requires, first of all, cozying up with China and the autocratic Gulf states – the main lenders to the US Treasury – as well working with Iran and Russia to limit the costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
As the US backtracks on its liberal standards, it is flirting with what can be called the “Beijing Consensus,” which makes economic development a country’s paramount goal and prescribes that states should actively steer growth in a way that suits national stability. 
What matters in this worldview is not the nature of any country’s political system, but the extent to which it improves its people’s wellbeing. 
At the diplomatic level, this implies that national interests, not universal norms, should drive cooperation. 
This diplomatic and economic realism is more than a reversal of the neo-conservative muscle-flexing of the George W. Bush years. 
It is an attempt by a declining power to use its restrained capabilities in a more economical way. 
For example, in times of crisis it is no shame for a government to be mercantilist, but by behaving in this way, the US has lost the moral high ground as a champion of free trade. 
America’s new pragmatism is also the consequence of a process of “reverse socialization.” 
Over the past two decades, the US and its European allies believed that they could inculcate the rest of the world with their economic and political principles. 
Countries like China became enmeshed in a web of multilateral organizations and subjugated to conditional engagement strategies. 
Nowadays, the West does not have the leverage to enforce these conditions. 
Moreover, the majority of developing countries now actively embrace multilateral bodies as part of their development strategies. 
As we move from a unipolar international order to one with multiple regional powers, realism should allow them to vie for influence while keeping the costs as low as possible. 
The result will be a new concert of powers, tied together by their fixation with national economic growth and the objective of discouraging others from causing instability that risks intervention. 
Instead of entrusting America with the arduous task of safeguarding international stability on its own, the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) will assume a more prominent role in policing their own backyards. 
Russia can have its Caucasus, and if the generals in Myanmar should go mad, it would become China’s and India’s problem to sort out. 
America’s policy shift will inevitably erode the Western liberal axis. 
America has the flexibility, capacity, and leadership to adapt to the new rules for pursuing diplomacy, but Europe simply does not. 
Its strategic relevance, even in the transatlantic partnership, is destined to weaken further. 
Realism will give the US more maneuverability in the short term, but it will have to sacrifice some of its soft power to achieve this. 
Whether America is able to strengthen its global influence in the future will depend not so much on its moral esteem, but on the extent to which it succeeds in revamping its economy and forging new alliances. 
The same will apply for other powers. 
But this rising Beijing Consensus offers no guarantee of stability. 
A concert of powers is only as strong as its weakest pillar, and requires a great deal of self-discipline and restraint. 
It remains to be seen how the American public will respond to its national U-turn. 
If one main player slides back into economic turmoil, nationalism will reduce the scope for pragmatic bargaining. 
Overlapping spheres of influence and frozen conflicts could again cause major conflict. 
And, if China comes out of the crisis as the big winner and continues to boost its power, zero-sum thinking will soon replace win-win cooperation. 
The Rise of the BRICs 
PRINCETON -- The winners of the great globalization push of the 1990’s were small states such as New Zealand, Chile, Dubai, Finland, Ireland, the Baltic Republics, Slovenia, and Slovakia. 
The East Asian tigers that pushed themselves onto the world economy’s center stage were small units, and in some cases – Singapore, Taiwan, or Hong Kong – were not even treated as states. 
Even South Korea, which is a giant in comparison, was only half a country. 
Such states are vulnerable, and the past is littered with small and successful globalizers that lost out because of power politics: the Italian city states of the Renaissance, the Dutch Republic, or, in the twentieth century, Lebanon and Kuwait. 
Small states frequently became the victims of larger but poorer neighbors envious of their success and eager to seize their assets, while oblivious to the fact that such seizure actually destroys the source of wealth and dynamism. 
In the world of pure globalization, small states do best, because they are more flexible and can adapt more easily to rapidly changing markets. 
Small states are better at public policy adjustments, freeing up labor markets, establishing a solid framework for competition, and facilitating cross-border takeovers and mergers. 
The urgency of such a program has been underscored in much recent analysis of the poor performance of the major continental European economies – France, Germany, and Italy – compared with smaller and much more dynamic economies in northern and central Europe. 
But, at the same time, small states are also more likely to be successful in defending crucial aspects of the welfare state. 
A larger state can inevitably do more to control the economy, and hence is exposed to the costly temptation to intervene in response to political pressure from vested interests. 
In a small-state setting, imposition of a dense network of controls is likely to lead to the loss of mobile factors of production, while in a large state it is harder for labor or capital to escape. 
On the international stage, large states try to make international rules, and often build their domestic legitimacy on their claims to be able to shape a larger world: they think in terms of what French thinkers call “harnessing globalization.” 
Instead of accepting the international system roughly as it is, with all its imperfections, they think that they can use their weight to alter the rules – in their favor. 
Small states’ nervousness and fear began to increase roughly in 2000. 
The new political realities were highlighted by the Iraq war, China’s search for energy sources in developing countries, and Russia’s assertiveness in foreign and domestic policy. 
In today’s world, it looks as if the new winners are big states with large populations and rapid growth: Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRICs), in addition to the United States. 
These dynamic giants terrify the wealthy populations of the industrialized world with the potential power of their low-cost competition, cheap products, and outsourcing of services. 
The BRICs (we might rewrite the term as Big and Really Imperial Countries) project power more easily, but they also need to project power to compensate for their weaknesses. 
They have their own problems, but at the same time they are likely to behave more like traditional big states, and will try to shape globalization rather than simply accepting it as an inevitable process. 
There are at least three obvious flaws that afflict these big globalizers much more than the small globalizers who had done so well previously. 
First, highly populous countries must integrate their poor and ill-educated underclass (in China and India mostly rural) as they engage with world markets. 
Second, China and Russia have financial systems that lack transparency, while Brazil and India are financially underdeveloped, putting further integration in the world economy at risk and increasing prospects for a financial crisis. 
Third, Russia is already facing massive demographic decline and an aging and sickening population; 
China faces the near certainty of a Japanese-style demographic downturn from the 2040’s onward, a belated legacy of its one-child policy. 
Flawed geo-political giants have in the past been a source of instability (Germany before World War I is an obvious analogy), and there are good reasons to see them presenting increased risk in the twenty-first century. 
But for the moment they are unquestionably powerful. 
The result is that the BRICs will look for compensating power, and military and strategic influence and prestige, as a way to solve internal problems. 
Gone are the 1990’s, when for a brief moment in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War, the world looked as if it would be permanently peaceful and unconcerned with power. 
That hope soon proved illusory. 
Many commentators, indeed, were stunned by the rapidity with which tensions returned to the international system. 
While many blame US behavior, these tensions have in fact been fueled by the unfolding of a new logic in international politics. 
The Rising Power of NGO's 
When Human Rights Watch declared last January that the Iraq War did not qualify as a humanitarian intervention, the international media took notice. 
According to the Internet database Factiva, 43 news articles mentioned the report, in publications ranging from the Kansas City Star to the Beirut Daily Star . 
Similarly, after the abuses of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison were disclosed, the views of Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross put pressure on the Bush administration both at home and abroad. 
As these examples suggest, today's information age has been marked by the growing role of non-governmental organizations (NGO's) on the international stage. 
This is not entirely new, but modern communications have led to a dramatic increase in scale, with the number of NGO's jumping from 6,000 to approximately 26,000 during the 1990's alone. 
Nor do numbers tell the whole story, because they represent only formally constituted organizations. 
Many NGO's claim to act as a "global conscience," representing broad public interests beyond the purview of individual states. 
They develop new norms by directly pressing governments and businesses to change policies, and indirectly by altering public perceptions of what governments and firms should do. 
NGO's do not have coercive "hard" power, but they often enjoy considerable "soft" power - the ability to get the outcomes they want through attraction rather than compulsion. 
Because they attract followers, governments must take them into account both as allies and adversaries. 
A few decades ago, large organizations like multinational corporations or the Roman Catholic Church were the most typical type of transnational organization. 
Such organizations remain important, but the reduced cost of communication in the Internet era has opened the field to loosely structured network organizations with little headquarters staff and even to individuals. 
These flexible groups are particularly effective in penetrating states without regard to borders. 
Because they often involve citizens who are well placed in the domestic politics of several countries, they can focus the attention of media and governments onto their issues, creating new transnational political coalitions. 
A rough way to gauge the increasing importance of transnational organizations is to count how many times these organizations are mentioned in mainstream media publications. 
The use of the term "non-governmental organization" or "NGO" has increased 17-fold since 1992. 
In addition to Human Rights Watch, other NGO's such as Transparency International, Oxfam, and Doctors without Borders have undergone exponential growth in terms of mainstream media mentions. 
By this measure, the biggest NGO's have become established players in the battle for the attention of influential editors. 
In these circumstances, governments can no longer maintain the barriers to information flows that historically protected officials from outside scrutiny. 
Even large countries with hard power, such as the United States, are affected. 
NGO's played key roles in the disruption of the World Trade Organization summit in 1999, the passage of the Landmines Treaty, and the ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in May 2003. 
The US, for example, initially had strong objections to the Convention on Tobacco Control, but dropped them in the face of international criticism. 
The Landmines Treaty was created despite the opposition of the strongest bureaucracy (the Pentagon) in the world's largest military power. 
Similarly, transnational corporations are often targets of NGO campaigns to "name and shame" companies that pay low wages in poor countries. 
Such campaigns sometimes succeed because they can credibly threaten to damage the value of global brand names. 
Royal Dutch Shell, for example, announced in 2003 that it would not drill in any spots designated by UNESCO as World Heritage sites. 
This decision came two years after the company acceded to pressure from environmentalists and scrapped plans to drill in a World Heritage site in Bangladesh. 
Transnational drug companies were shamed by NGO's into abandoning lawsuits in South Africa in 2002 over infringements of their patents on drugs to fight AIDS. 
Similar campaigns of naming and shaming have affected the investment and employment patterns of Mattel, Nike, and a host of other companies. 
NGO's vary enormously in their organization, budgets, accountability, and sense of responsibility for the accuracy of their claims. 
It is hyperbole when activists call such movements "the world's other superpower," yet governments ignore them at their peril. 
Some have reputations and credibility that give them impressive domestic as well as international soft power. 
Others lack credibility among moderate citizens but can mobilize demonstrations that demand the attention of governments. 
For better and for worse, NGO's and network organizations have resources and do not hesitate to use them. 
Do NGO's make world politics more democratic? 
Not in the traditional sense of the word. 
Most are elite organizations with narrow membership bases. 
Some act irresponsibly and with little accountability. 
Yet they tend to pluralize world politics by calling attention to issues that governments prefer to ignore, and by acting as pressure groups across borders. 
In that sense, they serve as antidotes to traditional government bureaucracies. 
Governments remain the major actors in world politics, but they now must share the stage with many more competitors for attention. 
Non-governmental actors are changing world politics. 
After Abu Ghraib, even US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld must take notice. 
The Rising Wealth of Nations 
The new Penn World Table, Version 6.2, comparing standards of living across countries, has just been released. 
The latest figures are for 2004, and, because of data lags, not all countries are included. 
Yet these numbers are valuable because they are of exceptional quality and they correct systematically for relative price differences across countries, which sometimes leads to surprising results. 
Among the 82 countries for which 2004 data are now available, there has been really good news: real per capita GDP has risen by an average of 18.9% between 2000 and 2004, or 4.4% per year. 
People generally are a lot better off than they were just a few years ago. 
At this rate, real per capita GDP will double every 16 years. 
Many people who could not afford a car in 2000 now have one, and people who could afford only one car in 2000 now have two. 
People who could not afford to send their children to a good school or college now can. 
And so it is with many different goods and services that people consume. 
One surprise is that there has been relatively little change in the ranking of countries by real per capita GDP since 2000. 
Despite all the talk about the Chinese economic miracle, China’s ranking has risen only slightly, from 61st out of 82 countries in 2000 to 60th in 2004 – even though per capita real GDP grew by 44% between 2000 and 2004, or 9.6% a year, the highest of the major countries. 
The reason China has not risen higher is that other countries have been growing too, and because the gaps between countries are enormous. 
The range between the poorest and the richest countries in the world is a factor of more than 100. 
The average real per capita GDP of the top 25% of countries is 15 times that of the bottom 25%. 
Watching these countries progress is like watching a marathon. 
At first, one is impressed by most of the runners, almost all of whom seem to be going fast. 
As they pass by, all spread out, one sees that some runners seem to be gaining rapidly. 
And yet they do not often overtake one another, because the distances between them are so large. 
Indeed, other runners are out of sight, perhaps miles ahead. 
China isn’t the only success story. 
Other big winners in terms of real per capita GDP between 2000 and 2004 are Lithuania (up 48%), Romania (up 41%), Estonia (up 40%), Chile (up 33%), Hungary (up 32%), Greece (up 31%), New Zealand (up 28%), Australia (up 25%), Korea (up 23%), Ireland (up 23%), South Africa (up 23%), and Nigeria (up 22%). 
Some of the worst performers among the major countries are Israel (a beleaguered country, with real per capita GDP up only 2% between 2000 and 2004) and Argentina (hit by a terrible financial crisis in 2001-2, up only 9% between 2000 and 2004). 
Economic performance in several Latin American countries was relatively weak in this period, with Uruguay’s real GDP per capita actually recording a fall by a fraction of a percent. 
But the overall picture is amazingly good. 
If such growth rates continue, we will see relatively poor countries like India, Indonesia, the Philippines, or Nicaragua reach the average levels currently enjoyed by advanced countries in 50 years. 
But, of course, they will not have caught up with these countries, for those countries will have moved ahead too. 
It is hard to imagine now what that world will be like with a doubling or quadrupling of just about every country’s GDP. 
What would all these countries do with all that money? 
In 1958, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote the best-selling book The Affluent Society , in which he argued that the advanced world as typified by the United States had by that year finally emerged from “grim scarcity,” when dire necessity dictated our lives, to a “world of affluence.” 
He wrote: “So great has been the change [in standards of living] that many of the desires of the individual are no longer even evident to him. 
They become so only as they are synthesized, elaborated and nurtured by advertising and salesmanship, and these, in turn, have become among our most important and talented professions.” 
But real per capita GDP in the US is now three times higher than it was in 1958. 
What have people been spending all that extra money on? 
Is it all dictated by advertisers and salesmen who are inventing needs? 
According to my calculations comparing 1958 and 2005 data from the US Department of Commerce, Americans spent 27% of the huge increase in income between 1958 and 2005 on medical care, 23% on their homes, 12% on transportation, 10% on recreation, and 9% on personal business activities. 
The kinds of things that advertisers and salesmen typically promote were relatively unimportant. 
Food got only 8% of the extra money, clothing only 3%, and personal care 1%. 
Unfortunately, idealistic activities also received little of the extra money: 3% for welfare and religious activities, and a similar share for education. 
Thus, most of the extra money was spent on staying healthy, having a nice home, traveling and relaxing, and doing a little business. 
That sounds like what really happened in the US. 
Maybe that is the way it will be around the world. 
As long as we can keep worldwide growth going at its current rate, billions of people can look forward to the same kind of improvement. 
And that should be truly inspirational. 
The Risk of European Centralization 
FRANKFURT – For many European leaders, the eurozone crisis demonstrates the need for “more Europe,” the final aim being to create a full-fledged political union. 
Given the continent’s history of war and ideological division, and today’s challenges posed by globalization, a peaceful, prosperous, and united Europe that wields influence abroad is surely a desirable goal. 
But major disagreements about how to achieve that goal remain. 
Historically, monetary union was regarded as the route to political union. 
In the 1950’s, the French economist Jacques Rueff, a close adviser to Charles de Gaulle, argued that “L’Europe se fera par la monnaie, ou ne se fera pas” (Europe will be made through the currency, or it will not be made). 
Germany’s President Richard von Weizsäcker echoed this view almost a half-century later, declaring that only via a single currency would Europeans achieve a common foreign policy. 
More recently, German Chancellor Angela Merkel asserted that “if the euro fails, Europe will fail.” 
But the crisis confronting “Europe” is not so much about political union as it is about European Economic and Monetary Union. 
If anything, efforts to hold EMU together may have taken us further from the goal of a common foreign policy by re-igniting within member states (regardless of whether they give or receive financial aid) nationalist resentments that we hoped had died long ago. 
Politicians launched monetary union in 1999, despite warnings that the constituent economies were too diverse. 
It wasn’t long before several states violated the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Later, the eurozone’s “no bail-out” principle was abandoned. 
The response to these failings, however, was a demand for greater economic integration, including such intermediate steps as the creation of a “European finance minister” or an EU commissioner with sweeping powers to facilitate closer integration. 
Such ideas, of course, ignored the central issues of national sovereignty and democracy, and specifically the privilege of nationally elected governments and parliaments to determine their own taxes and public spending. 
The fact that sovereign member states did not deliver on their European commitments is hardly a convincing argument for giving up sovereignty now. 
In short, all of the measures that would implicitly support political union have turned out to be inconsistent and dangerous. 
They have involved huge financial risks for eurozone members. 
They have fueled tensions among member states. 
Perhaps most important, they have undermined the basis on which political union rests – namely, persuading European Union citizens to identify with the European idea. 
Public support for “Europe” depends to a large degree on its economic success. 
Indeed, it is Europe’s economic achievements that give it a political voice in the world. 
But, as the current crisis indicates, the best-performing EU economies are those with (relatively) flexible labor markets, reasonable tax rates, and open access to professions and business. 
Moreover, the impetus for economic reform has come not from the EU, but from national governments, one of the most successful examples being “Agenda 2010,” launched a decade ago by then-German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. 
Numerous academic studies, following the work of the American economic historian Douglass North, support the notion that it is competition among states and regions that lays the groundwork for technological progress and economic growth. 
The total failure of the Lisbon Agenda, launched in March 2000 to make the EU “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-base economy in the world” demonstrated the weakness of a centralized approach. 
Arguably, in earlier centuries, it was competition within Europe that generated unparalleled dynamism and prosperity across much of the continent. 
To be sure, this was also a time of wars. However, this does not mean that centralization is the best – much less the only – way to guarantee peace. 
But, once again, EU leaders responded by concluding the opposite: the Lisbon Agenda’s failure was interpreted as justifying still more harmonization and centralization of national policies. 
True to form, in his “State of the Union” address to the European Parliament in September 2012, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso called for a more powerful Commission. 
This approach – harmonization, coordination, and centralized decision-making – continues to be regarded as a panacea for Europe’s problems. 
It is the sort of pretense of knowledge that the economist Friedrich von Hayek denounced as a recipe for constraining freedom and ensuring economic mediocrity. 
Indeed, the European project should start from the premise that appropriate institutions, property rights, and competition, together with a growth-friendly tax system and solid fiscal policies, are the basis of economic success. 
The dangers of a centralizing approach can also be seen in the relationship between the 17 current eurozone members and the 11 non-eurozone EU states. 
As the former press on with greater integration, the adverse economic consequences of doing so are likely to deter the latter from EMU participation (which may be another sign that institutional competition cannot be suppressed forever). 
There are plenty of areas in which common action at the EU level is both appropriate and efficient. 
Environmental policy is clearly one. 
But centralization of economic decision-making, as an end in itself, cannot underpin a prosperous and powerful Europe. 
Jean Monnet, one of the EU’s founding fathers, once said that, given the chance to start the European integration process again, he would have begun with culture – a dimension in which we neither need nor want centralization. 
Europe’s cultural richness consists precisely in its diversity, and the basis for its finest achievements has been competition between people, institutions, and places. 
Its current economic malaise reflects European leaders’ prolonged efforts to deny the obvious. 
Lending in the Dark 
HONG KONG – The proliferation of China’s opaque, loosely regulated (or unregulated) shadow-banking system has been raising fears of possible financial instability. 
But just how extensive – and how risky – is shadow banking in China? 
According to the China Banking Regulatory Commission, shadow banking (all credit not regulated by the same standards as conventional bank loans) increased from ¥800 billion ($130 billion) in 2008 to ¥7.6 trillion in 2012 (roughly 14.6% of GDP). 
Total off-balance-sheet banking activity in China – composed of credits to property developers (30-40%), local-government entities (20-30%), and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), individuals, and bridge-loan borrowers – was estimated to be as high as ¥17 trillion in 2012, roughly one-third of GDP. 
The term “shadow banking” gained prominence during the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States to account for non-bank assets in the capital market, such as money-market funds, asset-backed securities, and leveraged derivative products, usually funded by investment banks and large institutional investors. 
In 2007, the volume of shadow-banking transactions in the US exceeded that of conventional banking assets. 
The Financial Stability Board has estimated that total global shadow-banking assets in 2011 amounted to $67 trillion, with the US accounting for $23 trillion, the eurozone for $22 trillion, and the United Kingdom for $9 trillion. 
Chinese shadow banking totals only about $2.2 trillion. 
Shadow banking in China is dominated by lending to higher-risk borrowers, such as local governments, property developers, and SMEs. 
It is ultimately funded through retail bank deposits, banks’ wealth-management products, and private equity. 
Thus, the real issue in China is not the volume of shadow credit, but its quality, and the banking system’s capacity to absorb potential losses. 
Market forces and policy conflicts triggered shadow banking’s emergence in China. 
With the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) keeping interest rates artificially low, retail depositors began taking advantage of higher rates of return offered by local governments, property developers, and SMEs, which needed funding to maintain investment and adjust to a new market environment. 
Since 2008, shadow banking has exploded, owing to price and regulatory factors. 
In an environment dominated by direct quantitative controls, such as increasingly stringent lending quotas, shadow banking is meeting genuine market demand, with the interest rates that borrowers are willing to pay providing a useful price-discovery mechanism. 
China simply needs a better system for evaluating the quality of such credits (and for providing depositors with returns that can offset inflation). 
Chinese policymakers should view the shadow-banking scare as a market-driven opportunity to transform the banking system into an efficient, balanced, inclusive, and productive engine of growth. 
They should begin by reforming the property-rights regime to enable market forces to balance the supply and demand of savings and investments in a manner that maintains credit discipline and transparency. 
This requires, first and foremost, determining who – the investor or the bank – bears the underlying default risk of high-yield wealth-management products. 
Given that this is a legal question of contract definition and enforcement, it should be answered in the courts or arbitration tribunals, not by regulators. 
Clarifying ultimate responsibility for credit quality and risk would also reduce intermediation costs by eliminating the need to resort to informal channels, such as credit-guarantee and trust companies. 
Furthermore, reducing local-government financing vehicles’ exposures is essential. 
China needs to build its municipal bond market to generate more sustainable funding for infrastructure projects. 
Local governments could then privatize the massive assets that they have accumulated during years of rapid growth, using the proceeds to pay down their debt. 
Reform efforts should be supported by measures – such as strict enforcement of balance-sheet transparency requirements – to improve risk management. 
In fact, the existing shadow-banking risks are manageable, given relatively robust GDP growth and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. 
At the end of 2012, China’s commercial banks held ¥6.4 trillion in core capital and ¥1.5 trillion in non-performing-loan provisions, for a risk cushion of roughly ¥8 trillion. 
Low-risk central-government bonds and central-bank reserve requirements – most of which are backed by substantial foreign-exchange reserves – account for ¥31 trillion of the ¥95 trillion in total commercial-bank assets. 
Another ¥8 trillion are housing mortgages, which also carry little risk, given low loan-to-value ratios. 
Exposure to domestic sovereign obligations – by state-owned enterprises and local governments – accounts for about ¥32 trillion, and obligations by private firms amount to roughly ¥24 trillion. 
This breakdown suggests that the ¥8 trillion cushion would be sufficient to offset potential losses arising from higher-risk credit in China’s commercial banking sector. 
The high interest-rate margins set by the PBOC provide additional support. 
But, if more risk builds up through continued expansion of shadow credit, this risk buffer may become inadequate. 
Thus, Chinese policymakers must focus on curbing the shadow-banking sector’s growth, while ensuring that all current and future risks stemming from the system are laid bare. 
The introduction of measures to cool the property market, and new direct regulatory controls over shadow-banking credit, represent a step in the right direction. 
Perhaps the biggest challenges facing China are raising real returns on financial liabilities (deposits and wealth-management products) and promoting more balanced lending. 
Increased costs for investment in real assets would help to rein in property prices and reduce over-capacity in infrastructure and manufacturing. 
Ultimately, addressing shadow banking in China will require mechanisms that clearly define, allocate, and adjudicate financial risks among the key players. 
This includes ensuring that borrowers are accountable and that their liabilities are transparent; deleveraging municipal debt through asset sales and more transparent financing; and shifting the burden of resolving property-rights disputes from regulators to arbitrators and, eventually, to the judiciary. 
Such institutional reforms would go a long way toward eliminating default (or bailout) risk and creating a market-oriented financial system of balanced incentives that supports growth and innovation. 
The Risk Tsunami 
NEW YORK – It is time for the G-20 to take seriously its mandate to agree on steps to stabilize the global economy and launch it on a more sustainable pattern of growth. 
Instead, the G-20 is behaving like a debating society, with the cooperative approach that it fostered at the outset of the crisis devolving into an array of often-heedless unilateral actions by its members. 
Yet there are several significant risks to global economic stability and prosperity that must be addressed urgently. 
Ireland has thrown Europe into its second sovereign-debt crisis this year, and capital markets have become schizophrenic, with investment rushing back and forth across the Atlantic in response to contagion risk in Europe and quantitative easing in the United States. 
Meanwhile, capital is flooding into the higher-interest-rate emerging markets, causing inflationary pressures, driving up asset prices, and subjecting currencies to competitiveness-threatening appreciation – in short, distortions and policy headaches that require unconventional, defensive responses. 
Growth and employment forecasts in the advanced countries have been reduced – a delayed recognition of the reality of an extended and difficult recovery and a new post-crisis “normal.” 
With lower and more realistic growth forecasts, fiscal deficits in the short to medium term are viewed as more dangerous. 
In the US, a subset of policymakers believes that weakening growth and high unemployment require a policy response. 
With a cyclical mindset and fiscal space exhausted, a new round of quantitative easing (QE2) might be defended as a strategy for mitigating the tail risk of another downturn in asset markets (mainly housing) and households’ balance sheets – and with it the possibility of a deflationary dynamic. 
Worryingly, QE2 appears to be viewed in the US as a growth strategy, which it isn’t, unless one believes that low interest rates will reverse the private-sector deleveraging process, raise consumption, and lower savings – neither a likely nor a desirable scenario. 
It also assumes that addressing structural constraints on competitiveness can be deferred – perhaps permanently. 
The view from outside the US is that QE2 is either a mistake with negative external effects, or a policy with the clear but unannounced intention of devaluing the dollar – a move whose main negative competitive and growth effects would most likely be felt in Europe, not in China, India, and Brazil. 
Unilateral action in this and other dimensions has undercut the G-20’s mission of identifying and implementing mutually beneficial policies in a coordinated way. 
A minimal requirement for G-20 progress is that policies in emerging and advanced countries that have significant external effects are discussed and, if possible, agreed upon in advance. 
Apart from the need to deleverage for a few more years, the US economy faces longer-term problems with aggregate demand, employment, and income distribution that cannot be solved through consumption and investment alone. 
America needs to expand its share in external global demand, which requires public-sector investment, structural change, and improved competitiveness in the tradable sector. 
Meanwhile, Europe struggles to find a solution to its deficit and debt problems by treating them with short-term liquidity fixes whose purpose is to buy time for fiscal consolidation and, in the absence of the exchange-rate mechanism, some kind of deflationary process to restore external competitiveness. 
Success is by no means assured, and the most likely outcome is a sequence of contagion events and a broader loss of confidence in the euro. 
The core issue is burden-sharing across bondholders, citizens of the deficit countries, the EU, and, indeed, the rest of the world (via the International Monetary Fund). 
The emerging-market economies are at risk as a result. 
They can sustain relatively high growth rates in the face of weak and lengthy recoveries in the advanced countries, but not if there is a major downturn in North America or Europe (or both), a serious outbreak of protectionism, or instability in global financial markets. 
The major emerging economies also have growing systemic effects on growth and employment across a broad range of countries, including the advanced ones. 
They must understand this. 
The old asymmetries are fading away, and there are new distributional challenges at the core of global economy-policy coordination. 
For most of the postwar period, advanced countries grew by expanding the knowledge and technology base of their economies. 
In a rapidly opening global economy, emerging economies learned to access both technology and markets, thereby growing at unprecedented and accelerating rates. 
As global economic activity shifted and the structure of all economies evolved with it, the distributional effects were overwhelmingly benign. But that was not inevitable. 
It came out that way because, for most of the period, the advanced countries benefited from market-driven innovation, while the emerging economies imported knowledge, exported goods and services, and had limited systemic impact on advanced economies. 
That pattern is changing. 
Emerging economies’ scale is growing, and their positioning on the global value chain is shifting rapidly. 
Surveys of attitudes toward the evolving global economic system show a widening divergence among countries as well as subgroups within countries. 
These almost certainly reflect divergences in terms of that system’s distributional impacts. 
Guiding global interdependence in a way that ameliorates negative distributional trends is possible, but it will require wisdom and insight. 
That challenge must be at the core of the G-20’s mission. 
To put it differently, recognizing our collective interest in the openness of the global economy is not sufficient. 
We need a pragmatic willingness to adapt incentives and outcomes to achieve distributional results that allow the major players, with their domestic political constraints, to keep the system open. 
The alternative will be unilateral measures aimed at achieving the same goals, but leading to outcomes that leave everyone worse off. 
Ten QE Questions 
NEW YORK – Most observers regard unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing (QE) as necessary to jump-start growth in today’s anemic economies. 
But questions about the effectiveness and risks of QE have begun to multiply as well. 
In particular, ten potential costs associated with such policies merit attention. 
First, while a purely “Austrian” response (that is, austerity) to bursting asset and credit bubbles may lead to a depression, QE policies that postpone the necessary private- and public-sector deleveraging for too long may create an army of zombies: zombie financial institutions, zombie households and firms, and, in the end, zombie governments. 
So, somewhere between the Austrian and Keynesian extremes, QE needs to be phased out over time. 
Second, repeated QE may become ineffective over time as the channels of transmission to real economic activity become clogged. 
The bond channel doesn’t work when bond yields are already low; and the credit channel doesn’t work when banks hoard liquidity and velocity collapses. 
Indeed, those who can borrow (high-grade firms and prime households) don’t want or need to, while those who need to – highly leveraged firms and non-prime households – can’t, owing to the credit crunch. 
Moreover, the stock-market channel leading to asset reflation following QE works only in the short run if growth fails to recover. 
And the reduction in real interest rates via a rise in expected inflation when open-ended QE is implemented risks eventually stoking inflation expectations. 
Third, the foreign-exchange channel of QE transmission – the currency weakening implied by monetary easing – is ineffective if several major central banks pursue QE at the same time. 
When that happens, QE becomes a zero-sum game, because not all currencies can fall, and not all trade balances can improve, simultaneously. 
The outcome, then, is “QE wars” as proxies for “currency wars.” 
Fourth, QE in advanced economies leads to excessive capital flows to emerging markets, which face a difficult policy challenge. 
Sterilized foreign-exchange intervention keeps domestic interest rates high and feeds the inflows. 
But unsterilized intervention and/or reducing domestic interest rates creates excessive liquidity that can feed domestic inflation and/or asset and credit bubbles. 
At the same time, forgoing intervention and allowing the currency to appreciate erodes external competitiveness, leading to dangerous external deficits. 
Yet imposing capital controls on inflows is difficult and sometimes leaky. 
Macroprudential controls on credit growth are useful, but sometimes ineffective in stopping asset bubbles when low interest rates continue to underpin generous liquidity conditions. 
Fifth, persistent QE can lead to asset bubbles both where it is implemented and in countries where it spills over. 
Such bubbles can occur in equity markets, housing markets (Hong Kong, Singapore), commodity markets, bond markets (with talk of a bubble increasing in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan), and credit markets (where spreads in some emerging markets, and on high-yield and high-grade corporate debt, are narrowing excessively). 
Although QE may be justified by weak economic and growth fundamentals, keeping rates too low for too long can eventually feed such bubbles. 
That is what happened in 2000-2006, when the US Federal Reserve aggressively cut the federal funds rate to 1% during the 2001 recession and subsequent weak recovery and then kept rates down, thus fueling credit/housing/subprime bubbles. 
Sixth, QE can create moral-hazard problems by weakening governments’ incentive to pursue needed economic reforms. 
It may also delay needed fiscal austerity if large deficits are monetized, and, by keeping rates too low, prevent the market from imposing discipline. 
Seventh, exiting QE is tricky. 
If exit occurs too slowly and too late, inflation and/or asset/credit bubbles could result. 
Also, if exit occurs by selling the long-term assets purchased during QE, a sharp increase in interest rates might choke off recovery, resulting in large financial losses for holders of long-term bonds. 
And, if the exit occurs via a rise in the interest rate on excess reserves (to sterilize the effect of a base-money overhang on credit growth), the ensuing losses for central banks’ balance sheets could be significant. 
Eighth, an extended period of negative real interest rates implies a redistribution of income and wealth from creditors and savers toward debtors and borrowers. 
Of all the forms of adjustment that can lead to deleveraging (growth, savings, orderly debt restructuring, or taxation of wealth), debt monetization (and eventually higher inflation) is the least democratic, and it seriously damages savers and creditors, including pensioners and pension funds. 
Ninth, QE and other unconventional monetary policies can have serious unintended consequences. 
Eventually, excessive inflation may erupt, or credit growth may slow, rather than accelerate, if banks – faced with very low net interest-rate margins – decide that risk relative to reward is insufficient. 
Finally, there is a risk of losing sight of any road back to conventional monetary policies. 
Indeed, some countries are ditching their inflation-targeting regime and moving into uncharted territory, where there may be no anchor for price expectations. 
The US has moved from QE1 to QE2 and now to QE3, which is potentially unlimited and linked to an unemployment target. 
Officials are now actively discussing the merit of negative policy rates. 
And policymakers have moved to a risky credit-easing policy as QE’s effectiveness has waned. 
In short, policies are becoming more unconventional, not less, with little clarity about short-term effects, unintended consequences, and long-term impacts. 
To be sure, QE and other unconventional monetary policies do have important short-term benefits. 
But if such policies remain in place for too long, their side effects could be severe – and the longer-term costs very high. 
Asia’s Rebalancing Act 
SEOUL – Rapid economic growth in China undoubtedly benefits the rest of Asia. 
Indeed, strong Chinese demand has supported its trading partners’ export-led growth for much of the past three decades. 
But now, faced with a slowdown in China and significant downside risks there, the rest of Asia must abandon over-reliance on export-oriented development strategies and strive to ensure stable and sustainable growth domestically and regionally. 
China’s vulnerabilities and risks – stemming from property bubbles, shadow banking, and local-government debt – have triggered concerns about a crisis not only there, but also in neighboring Asian countries. 
Some, indeed, now predict a Chinese banking or fiscal disaster; others predict long-term stagnation equivalent to Japan’s lost decades. 
These “hard landing” scenarios are extreme. 
But the road ahead is bumpy and uncertain. 
No one can guarantee that Prime Minister Li Keqiang’s attempts to achieve deleveraging and structural reform will succeed. 
Moreover, external shocks, policy mistakes, and political instability could disrupt even the best-laid plans. 
In any case, China’s stellar growth record cannot be sustained. 
Even if it manages a “soft landing,” annual output growth will slow to 5-6% in the coming decades. 
Standard growth theory predicts “convergence” of per capita GDP: a fast-growing country will eventually encounter difficulty maintaining high rates of labor mobilization, capital accumulation, and technological progress. 
In China, labor inputs have fallen as a result of declining fertility and an aging population. 
Reduced rates of return will lower investment rates. 
China may be able to rely on policy reforms to boost productivity growth; but, with relatively low innovative capacity, it will struggle to catch up with frontier technologies. 
China’s inevitable growth slowdown, along with a large tail risk, threatens stable growth in Asian economies that have become increasingly interdependent. 
Trade within Asia now accounts for more than half of the continent’s total trade turnover. 
Moreover, direct investment and financial flows contribute further to economic interdependence. 
The rise in intra-Asian trade reflects China’s central role in East Asia’s production networks. 
From 2001 to 2011, China’s share of South Korean exports doubled, from 12% to 24%; its share of Japanese exports grew even faster, rising from 8% to 20%. 
As a result, China has become South Korea’s single largest export market, and Japan’s second largest. 
It is also the largest trading partner of all ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
Asian economies’ deepening trade and financial integration has left them increasingly vulnerable to growth shocks from China, with exporters of commodities and capital goods especially vulnerable. 
In fact, a study by the Asian Development Bank shows that Chinese shocks have larger and more persistent effects on individual Asian economies’ output than do global shocks, as a 1% increase in China’s GDP raised GDP in emerging East Asia by about 0.6%. 
In terms of investment, the International Monetary Fund predicts that a disruption in China’s investment boom will adversely affect its trading partners. 
A drop of one percentage point in China’s investment rate is estimated to reduce Taiwan’s GDP growth rate by 0.9 percentage points and Korea’s by 0.6 percentage points. 
If China can successfully rebalance its economy and shift to consumption-based growth, its trading partners could benefit enormously from a huge retail market. 
But as long as China’s import share of final consumption remains low, direct gains for exporters of consumer goods are likely to be small. 
As they prepare for the coming Chinese slowdown and seek to minimize the risk of regional destabilization, Asian economies must strengthen domestic demand and reduce excessive reliance on exports to China. 
In other words, sustainable growth requires all of Asia’s China-dependent economies to rebalance their two main growth engines. 
To enhance domestic demand, Asia, including China, must reallocate resources and structurally transform the economy. 
Reinforcing social safety nets, broadening and deepening financial markets, and supporting small and medium-size enterprises would also strengthen domestic demand. 
Likewise, service-sector liberalization will be essential to promoting productivity and creating jobs. 
In short, implementation of fiscal, financial, and structural reforms can mitigate the spillover effects from China’s slowdown. 
But a second reform front, aimed at enhancing regional coordination, must also be opened. 
With economic shocks able to spread more quickly than ever before, owing to broadened trade and financial channels, all Asian countries must maintain a sound macroeconomic environment. 
Perhaps most important, deeper regional integration calls for closer cooperation in macroeconomic and financial surveillance, as envisaged by the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization. 
Asian countries must be able to conduct well-coordinated candid reviews of one another to reduce the likelihood of risks and detect emerging vulnerabilities. 
China’s long-term growth potential – and that of the rest of developing Asia – is not pre-defined. 
Maximizing it requires not only that individual countries address their weaknesses and rebalance their sources of growth, but also that they build and strengthen the regional institutions needed to manage economic integration. 
Brave New Cells? 
LONDON – The United Kingdom’s Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has launched a public consultation to gauge attitudes toward controversial new medical procedures aimed at preventing the transmission of incurable diseases that result from mutations of cell structures called mitochondria. 
Supporters of such research are framing criticism of it as opposition to saving children’s lives and an impediment to scientific development. 
But this view neglects a crucial factor in the debate: the techniques being developed involve permanent genetic alterations passed on to future generations. 
The mitochondria are the energy-producing “batteries” of the cell, containing the only DNA outside of the cell nucleus – 37 genes, or roughly 0.2% of a person’s genetic makeup. 
Given that these genes are contained in the egg, and thus are inherited only from the mother, the new techniques aim to replace the mother’s mutated mitochondria with that of a healthy female donor of eggs without the mutation. 
This results in embryos that contain genetic material from three people – the child’s father and mother, plus the egg donor. 
So the real question is how the public feels about crossing the line between medical treatments for existingpeople and irreversible genetic alterations that would be passed on to future generations through genetic modification of the human germline (the sequence of germ cells,such as sperm and eggs, containing genetic material that a child may inherit). 
Despite the good intentions behind mitochondrial research, international concern about the implications of breaching this barrier is mounting. 
Indeed, not only do most scientists and governments worldwide consider human germline genetic modification unacceptable; it is expressly prohibited in more than 40 countries, including the UK. 
As a result, experts in the United States, Canada, Germany, Israel, and elsewhere have responded critically to the prospect of Britain unilaterally undermining the consensus that prohibits such techniques. 
Mitochondrial mutations can have serious consequences, including epilepsy, liver failure, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy. 
But, while the number of people affected by such mutations is estimated to be between one in 200 and one in 400, mutations do not translate to serious diseases in most cases. 
Because the harmful changes are often only present in low levels, and because a single cell can contain both mutated and normal mitochondria, it is widely believed that only one person in 5,000 – or even one in 10,000 – will be affected by mitochondrial disease. 
Despite this relatively low frequency, the Wellcome Trust (an organization dedicated to improving human and animal health) recently donated £4 million ($6.5 million) to scientists at the University of Newcastle to establish a center for mitochondrial research. 
In a 2010 paper, the scientists reported some early success with a technique involving the use of human zygotes (single-cell embryos) that had been engineered to contain only healthy mitochondria. 
But they managed to develop only 8% of the zygotes to a slightly later stage. 
Nevertheless, in 2011, a coalition of scientists and funders submitted a letter to former UK Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley requesting regulation revision, in order to permit the new techniques’ use in clinical treatment “once sufficient pre-clinical evidence [was] established.” 
The influential groups backing the coalition – including the UK Academy of Medical Sciences, the Medical Research Council, and the Wellcome Trust – claimed that “translating research into treatment [looked] achievable in the near future.” 
But “treatment” does not mean helping existing sufferers. 
Rather, the techniques might allow a small subset of women with mitochondrial disease (in the UK, roughly 10-20 annually) to reduce the risk that their children will inherit the mutation – at the cost of setting a precedent with serious potential consequences. 
In addition to national legislation, international treaties like the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (which the UK has not signed) specifically prohibit human germline genetic modification. 
The easy explanation for this prohibition would be moral aversion to eugenics, the pseudoscience of improving a population’s genetic composition, which was popular in the West in the first half of the twentieth century, before being discredited by the example of the Nazis. 
Unlike eugenicists, proponents of altering mitochondrial DNA simply hope to free future generations from deadly diseases. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the slippery slope. 
After all, breaching the ethical and legal barrier to permanent genetic modification could make it more difficult to block its application for treating non-lethal conditions, or even for enhancing qualities like cognitive ability or athletic prowess. 
But the more urgent threat is that any kind of germline genetic modification could do long-term, permanent damage. 
The HFEA’s own expert panel reported that the safety of mitochondrial techniques is far from being proven for current users. 
There is no telling what it could mean for their descendants. 
According to Joanna Poulton, an expert in mitochondrial research at Oxford University, it is not yet appropriate to offer treatment with so little knowledge of the potential consequences when reasonable alternatives – such as egg donation from a woman unaffected by mitochondrial disease or pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – are available. 
She says, “There are very few families who don’t want to use donated oocytes (eggs), where PGD would not work, and where the risk of having severely affected babies is so high that it might be worth trying the new techniques.” 
In fact, mitochondrial studies have already begun to produce unexpected results. 
For example, scientists in Oregon recently observed abnormal fertilization in some of the human eggs that they had manipulated. 
Given that the defective eggs miscarry naturally, more eggs than expected would be needed for the technique – possibly posing a risk to the donors. 
Indeed, in their study, the team used 106 eggs from seven women, one of whom donated a total of 28 eggs, indicating possible ovarian hyperstimulation, which can be dangerous or even fatal. 
Like all human endeavors, science gets some things wrong. 
Germline genetic modification threatens to make such errors permanent. 
The UK scientific and charitable organizations advocating mitochondrial research are proud of the permissive legislative framework that has enabled them to establish an “international lead.” 
But extending that leniency to human germline genetic modification may well cause future generations to view their actions very differently. 
The Risky Rich 
NEW YORK – Today’s swollen fiscal deficits and public debt are fueling concerns about sovereign risk in many advanced economies. 
Traditionally, sovereign risk has been concentrated in emerging-market economies. 
After all, in the last decade or so, Russia, Argentina, and Ecuador defaulted on their public debts, while Pakistan, Ukraine, and Uruguay coercively restructured their public debt under the threat of default. 
But, in large part – and with a few exceptions in Central and Eastern Europe – emerging-market economies improved their fiscal performance by reducing overall deficits, running large primary surpluses, lowering their stock of public debt-to-GDP ratios, and reducing the currency and maturity mismatches in their public debt. 
As a result, sovereign risk today is a greater problem in advanced economies than in most emerging-market economies. 
Indeed, rating-agency downgrades, a widening of sovereign spreads, and failed public-debt auctions in countries like the United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, and Spain provided a stark reminder last year that unless advanced economies begin to put their fiscal houses in order, investors, bond-market vigilantes, and rating agencies may turn from friend to foe. 
The severe recession, combined with the financial crisis during 2008-2009, worsened developed countries’ fiscal positions, owing to stimulus spending, lower tax revenues, and backstopping and ring-fencing of their financial sectors. 
The impact was greater in countries that had a history of structural fiscal problems, maintained loose fiscal policies, and ignored fiscal reforms during the boom years. 
In the future, a weak economic recovery and an aging population are likely to increase the debt burden of many advanced economies, including the United States, the UK, Japan, and several euro-zone countries. 
More ominously, monetization of these fiscal deficits is becoming a pattern in many advanced economies, as central banks have started to swell the monetary base via massive purchases of short- and long-term government paper. 
Eventually, large monetized fiscal deficits will lead to a fiscal train wreck and/or a rise in inflation expectations that could sharply increase long-term government bond yields and crowd out a tentative and so far fragile economic recovery. 
Fiscal stimulus is a tricky business. 
Policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. 
If they remove the stimulus too soon by raising taxes, cutting spending, and mopping up the excess liquidity, the economy may fall back into recession and deflation. 
But if monetized fiscal deficits are allowed to run, the increase in long-term yields will put a chokehold on growth. 
Countries with weaker initial fiscal positions – such as Greece, the UK, Ireland, Spain, and Iceland – have been forced by the market to implement early fiscal consolidation. 
While that could be contractionary, the gain in fiscal-policy credibility might prevent a damaging spike in long-term government-bond yields. 
So early fiscal consolidation can be expansionary on balance. 
For the Club Med members of the euro zone – Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal – public-debt problems come on top of a loss of international competitiveness. 
These countries had already lost export-market shares to China and other low value-added and labor-intensive Asian economies. 
Then a decade of nominal-wage growth that out-paced productivity gains led to a rise in unit labor costs, real exchange-rate appreciation, and large current-account deficits. 
The euro’s recent sharp rise has made this competitiveness problem even more severe, reducing growth further and making fiscal imbalances even larger. 
So the question is whether these euro-zone members will be willing to undergo painful fiscal consolidation and internal real depreciation through deflation and structural reforms in order to increase productivity growth and prevent an Argentine-style outcome: exit from the monetary union, devaluation, and default. 
Countries like Latvia and Hungary have shown a willingness to do so. 
Whether Greece, Spain, and other euro-zone members will accept such wrenching adjustments remains to be seen. 
The US and Japan might be among the last to face the wrath of the bond-market vigilantes: the dollar is the main global reserve currency, and foreign-reserve accumulation – mostly US government bills and bonds – continues at a rapid pace. 
Japan is a net creditor and largely finances its debt domestically. 
But investors will become increasingly cautious even about these countries if the necessary fiscal consolidation is delayed. 
The US is a net debtor with an aging population, unfunded entitlement spending on social security and health care, an anemic economic recovery, and risks of continued monetization of the fiscal deficit. 
Japan is aging even faster, and economic stagnation is reducing domestic savings, while the public debt is approaching 200% of GDP. 
The US also faces political constraints to fiscal consolidation: Americans are deluding themselves that they can enjoy European-style social spending while maintaining low tax rates, as under President Ronald Reagan. 
At least European voters are willing to pay higher taxes for their public services. 
If America’s Democrats lose in the mid-term elections this November, there is a risk of persistent fiscal deficits as Republicans veto tax increases while Democrats veto spending cuts. 
Monetizing the fiscal deficits would then become the path of least resistance: running the printing presses is much easier than politically painful deficit reduction. 
But if the US does use the inflation tax as a way to reduce the real value of its public debt, the risk of a disorderly collapse of the US dollar would rise significantly. 
America’s foreign creditors would not accept a sharp reduction in their dollar assets’ real value that debasement of the dollar via inflation and devaluation would entail. 
A disorderly rush to the exit could lead to a dollar collapse, a spike in long-term interest rates, and a severe double dip recession. 
The Road Ahead in the Middle East 
During these hard times for Israeli-Palestinian relations, it is vital that positive steps be taken and international goodwill be mobilized. 
For a significant number of both Palestinians and Israelis, the use of force has come to represent the only conceivable option. 
Palestinian society can feel very little hope in the immediate term, so what else is there to lose? 
Yet it seems just as clear that the pursuit of extreme measures by any party will surely lead to wider and worse clashes. 
Rather than resign ourselves to more years of hate and misery, it is urgent that the foundations for future peace be rebuilt before all civilized structures are swept away. 
The priority in everyone's minds is the present conflict; but until human well being becomes a universal priority, conflicts will continue to dominate interpersonal and international relations. 
Those who wish to contribute to reducing tensions should identify and promote starting points for peace-builders to find common ground. 
Political and media support ought to focus on programs that work on the ground, as reported by humanitarian and non-governmental agencies, and not on particular religious agendas. 
Priority should go to cooperative projects--enhancing cooperation between different faiths, between different schools within the same faith, and between religious and secular groups. 
Islam as a religion of peace and human betterment is betrayed by anyone who commits atrocities in its name. 
It is a broad and inclusive religion whose adherents across the world presently suffer from their lack of a unified voice. 
For example, issuing fatwas , or religious edicts, is legitimately undertaken by those whose high standing is acknowledged by the whole Ummah , or Muslim community. 
We need trustworthy and reputable bodies for issuing globally significant fatwa , with the authority to represent Muslim communities worldwide; such bodies could be based in Mecca and Najaf, representing Sunni and Shi'a centers of religious thought. 
Such a step would bring to non-Muslims some of the sharpest thinking in the Islamic world, and would contribute a missing voice to debates about global values. 
Globalization and Islam are not incompatible, so long as Islam is recognized as a tradition that has much to contribute to world civilization, not treated as a menace to be neutralized. 
The goal today must be to modernize each tradition, while remaining faithful to its roots. 
A total collapse of religious norms would truly be destabilizing. 
If it is to succeed in making the world a better place, globalization can not be predicated upon market forces alone, but needs to reinforce the stability and integration of diverse societies. 
In the Middle East, clear ethical leadership is needed. 
But such leadership cannot achieve results in a vacuum. 
Global standards of behavior can only be implemented effectively if they are upheld by all. 
If a supposedly universal policy is seen to be applied inconsistently in order to further one nation's or culture's interests, that policy will lose credibility and be rejected as representing a double standard. 
It is the responsibility of rulers and opinion leaders to insist that universal rights are implemented universally--that all, without exception, are subject to the rule of law. 
Only when we achieve a culture of compliance with humanitarian norms will we be able to establish the framework for securing a vibrant civil society, negotiation instead of conflict, and continuing human welfare. 
The developed world has an obligation to live up to the standards of the Declaration of Human Rights and other documents describing universal norms. 
One of the most important expressions of goodwill is the gift of humanitarian aid. 
At this time, when military conflict risks worsening in different corners of the world, western agencies in particular can support the people of a troubled area. 
Yet humanitarian aid must not become just another foreign policy tool. 
If aid is thought by the people receiving it to be manipulated for political gain, it will reduce the possibility for international relations based on any kind of trust. 
There should be a re-evaluation of the place of altruism and compliance with universal humanitarian norms. 
The international community can offer stability and improvements in living conditions for both Israelis and Palestinians by intervening now with a peacekeeping and humanitarian presence, endorsed by the United Nations and with the support of the United States. 
Outside intervention may be necessary, including international commitment to specific objectives--not just to a process intended to reach those objectives--before it becomes possible to visualize a viable future in which both parties can flourish alongside each other. 
The Road from Crony Capitalism 
BRATISLAVA: In the ten years of postcommunist transition, political reform has often been reduced to the issue of holding free elections. 
Economic reform was often simplistically understood as only (or at least above all) encompassing macroeconomic stabilisation as promoted by the so-called 'Washington consensus,' now being condemned by demonstrators in the streets of Washington. 
It is no surprise that the results of so simplistic a policy prescription were often illiberal democracy and crony capitalism. 
The transition in my country, Slovakia B and, indeed, across Central and Eastern Europe B has turned out to be a more complicated, complex, and longer process than originally expected. 
The basic problem lies in the fact that the heritage of communism is a much greater burden than the majority of people, including experts, ever imagined, and was much more about the inheritance in people's heads than the inherited economic structure. 
At a recent conference in Moscow, however, IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fisher continued to stress the importance of the 'Washington consensus' - ie, macroeconomic stabilisation based on liberalizing prices and trade, currency convertibility, tight budgetary and monetary policy and rapid privatisation B for the success of reform. 
That consensus remains important, but it is insufficient for success. 
Building effective institutions is equally important. 
For illiberal democracy and crony capitalism flourish where the institutional framework is lacking or corrupted. 
Both have the same poisoned roots, so it is not surprising that they go hand in hand. 
The higher the degree of a democracy's illiberality, the higher the degree of corruption, moral hazard, opportunism and rent seeking behaviour; the more corrupted the economy, the more stunted democracy is likely to be. 
By illiberal democracy I mean a system where, though governments are elected in free (but not always fair) elections, they still fail to respect the basic principles and values of "constitutional liberalism," including the rule of law, division of power, an independent judiciary, and respect and protection of human rights and freedoms. 
Crony capitalism can be understood as a system, which, though based on some market relations and private ownership, fails to respect such important rules as the enforce-ability of law, free and fair competition, equality of opportunity, protection of ownership, transparency, and public control. 
Crony capitalism is a system that gives free rein to phenomena such as hidden connections between political and economic power, corruption, clientelism, and embezzlement. 
As it takes hold, the fairness of the political process shrivels. 
Can this vicious circle - which is not just a theoretical threat but an unfortunate reality in many countries - be broken? 
The first step is to identify its main causes which, in my opinion, reside in a society's shared values and patterns of behaviour, its so-called informal rules. 
Unlike formal rules, such as laws, these informal strictures do not need to be enforced because in principle, in every democracy (including illiberal ones), politicians only do what people allow them to do. 
In the postcommunist democracies, however, these informal societal values and principles are only dimly perceived, if they are perceived at all, by a majority of the population. 
In developed countries, such values have been nurtured by decades of functioning "constitutional liberalism," including, as the author Fareed Zakaria noted, regimes that can be called "liberal autocracies," such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
In this regard, history's heritage in Central Europe is extraordinarily tangled. 
People in the territory of what is now Slovakia have lived in seven different states and under five different political systems in the 20th century, from the liberal autocracy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1901-1918), through the liberal democracy of the inter-war Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1939), to the fascist wartime Slovak state (1939-1945), back to a Czechoslovak liberal democracy (1945-1948), then to the communist Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1948-1989), the liberal democracy of the Czechoslovak Federative Republic (1989-1992). 
Since the "Velvet Divorce" which separated Slovakia and the Czech Republic, there have been liberal democratic periods as well as the illiberal democracy of Vladimir Meciar's regime of 1994-1998. 
Patterns from that seesawing past inevitably influence the present. 
By examining the voting patterns of people in individual regions of Slovakia in the 1918-1939 and 1990-1998 periods, the Slovak sociologist Vladimir Krivy revealed that municipalities and regions that inclined towards liberal parties in the inter-war period continued to be so disposed when freedom was restored after 1989-1998. 
In other municipalities and regions the majority continued to support authoritarian parties and reject classic liberal principles, under both liberal and illiberal regimes. 
Is it possible to break the cycle of illiberal democracy and crony capitalism? 
Slovakia offers a positive example of such a rupture. 
The 1998 elections that saw the defeat of Vladimir Meciar's regime clearly demonstrated that a break can be made. 
Six factors played a key role here: 
-- a change of generations; 
-- improved education; 
-- availability of information; 
-- a unified opposition respecting classic liberal values; 
-- growth in the influence of civil society. 
Many of these forces for change grew in direct opposition to Meciar's misrule. 
I believe that they are necessary factors for the success of truly liberal democracies and modern market economies to take root even in countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Balkan States. 
They are also needed if reform in the countries of Central Europe is to be accelerated. 
Developed countries and international institutions should focus their attention and support on nourishing their growth. 
The Road from Depression 
NEW YORK – Financial markets are driving the world towards another Great Depression with incalculable political consequences. 
The authorities, particularly in Europe, have lost control of the situation. 
They need to regain control, and they need to do so now. 
Three bold steps are needed. 
First, the governments of the eurozone must agree in principle on a new treaty creating a common treasury for the eurozone. 
In the meantime, the major banks must be put under the direction of the European Central Bank in exchange for a temporary guarantee and permanent recapitalization. 
Third, the ECB would enable countries such as Italy and Spain temporarily to refinance their debt at a very low cost. 
These steps would calm the markets and give Europe time to develop a growth strategy without which the debt problem cannot be solved. 
Indeed, the importance of developing a growth strategy cannot be overstated, because the debt burden – the ratio of debt to annual GDP – rises and falls in part as a function of the rate of economic growth. 
Since a eurozone treaty establishing a common treasury will take a long time to conclude, in the interim the member states must appeal to the financial authority that already exists, the ECB, to fill the vacuum. 
In its current form, the embryo of a common treasury – the European Financial Stabilization Facility – is only a source of funds; how they are spent is left to the member states. 
Enabling the EFSF to cooperate with the ECB will require a newly created intergovernmental agency, which will have to be authorized by Germany’s Bundestag and perhaps by other eurozone members’ parliaments as well. 
The immediate task is to erect the necessary safeguards against contagion from a possible Greek default. 
Two vulnerable groups – the banks and the government bonds of countries like Italy and Spain – need to be protected. 
To accomplish these related tasks, the EFSF would be used primarily to guarantee and recapitalize the banks. 
Systemically important banks would have to agree with the EFSF to abide by the ECB’s instructions as long as the guarantees are in force. 
Banks that refuse would not be guaranteed, but enough would agree to provide the ECB with the required critical mass. 
The ECB would then instruct the banks to maintain their credit lines and loan portfolios while closely monitoring the risks they run for their own accounts. 
These arrangements would stop the concentrated deleveraging that is one of the main causes of the crisis. 
Completing the recapitalization would remove the incentive to deleverage, at which point the blanket guarantee can be withdrawn. 
To relieve the pressure on the government bonds of countries like Italy, the ECB would lower its discount rate. 
It would then encourage the countries concerned to finance themselves entirely by issuing treasury bills – and encourage the banks to buy them. 
The banks could rediscount the bills with the ECB, but they would not do so as long as they earned more on the bills than on the cash. 
These measures would allow Greece to default without causing a global meltdown – which does not mean that Greece would be forced into default. 
If Greece met its targets, the EFSF could underwrite a “voluntary” restructuring at, say, 50 cents on the euro. 
The EFSF would have enough money left to guarantee and recapitalize the European banks, and it would be left to the IMF to recapitalize the Greek banks. 
How Greece fared under these circumstances would be up to the Greeks. 
I believe that these steps would bring the acute phase of the euro crisis to an end by staunching its two main sources (weak banks and vulnerable sovereigns) and reassuring the markets that a longer-term solution is in sight. 
The longer-term solution itself would be more complicated because the regime imposed by the ECB would leave no room for fiscal stimulus and the debt problem cannot be resolved without growth. 
How to create viable fiscal rules for the euro would be left to the treaty negotiations. 
Many other proposals are under discussion, because officials now realize that “kicking the can down the road” has brought them to the end of the highway. 
Most of these proposals seek to leverage the EFSF by turning it into a bank, an insurance company, or a special-purpose vehicle that takes the riskier tranche of a public-private partnership. 
While practically any proposal is likely to bring temporary relief, the financial markets are just as likely to see through them and find them wanting, especially if they violate Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty (the no-bailout clause), which my proposal scrupulously respects. 
That said, some form of leverage could be used in recapitalizing the banks. 
The course of action outlined here does not require leveraging or increasing the size of the EFSF. 
But it is more radical, because it puts the banks under European control. 
That is liable to arouse the opposition of both the banks and national authorities – opposition that only public pressure can overcome. 
The Road Map Includes Damascus 
Powerful countries know that it is dangerous to be seen to flinch, because enemies take heart and allies’ knees begin to knock. 
A great power also knows that if it sets out on a military adventure without setting achievable goals, it can get into bad trouble. 
What’s true for great powers is doubly true for beleaguered Israel, which failed to dismantle Hezbollah’s power over Lebanon. 
But the Lebanon war’s failure may yet provide an opening to peace if Israel is bold enough to seize it. 
The world has two chief aims in the area between Cairo and Teheran: to maintain peace in the wider Middle East so that oil flows freely through the Persian Gulf; to steer the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians toward a settlement that guarantees the safety of Israel in its internationally recognised borders, while meeting the Palestinian people’s legitimate national aspirations for their own state. 
The two issues have long been connected, but the main link is now President Bashar Al-Assad’s Syria. 
Isolated, desperate for allies, Syria has been helping Iran in its quest for regional hegemony. 
Since Lebanon’s Cedar Revolution evicted Syria last year, the Syrians have sought to haul Lebanon back within their sphere of influence. 
They back Hezbollah – and help Iran send it weapons – because Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah’s shock troops keep the government in Beirut weak. 
The Syrians also like to present themselves as the last real Arab defenders of the Palestinian cause. 
In short, Syria, with its geographical position, its Iranian links and weapons, and its brutal Ba’athist regime, has become the lynchpin of developments between the Mediterranean and the Gulf. 
To secure Lebanon, and to bring Hamas to the bargaining table with Israel, it is Syria that Israel and the United States must deal with, one way or another. 
Syria’s position and interests should make it amenable to a deal. 
Of course, Syria still believes in a “Greater Syria” and never fully accepted Lebanon’s sovereignty. 
Syrian intelligence and troops – present in Lebanon since 1976 – were forced out in 2005 only under enormous international pressure and $1billion were lost in smuggling revenue last year much of which previously flowed to the Syrian military. 
Many of the Hezbollah rockets that rained on Israel bore the markings of Syria’s Defence Ministry. 
Yet Syria has one redeeming feature: it is a secular country that traditionally recoils from Islamic fundamentalism. 
Indeed, President Hafez Al-Assad, Bashar’s father, massacred up to 38,000 mainly Sunni fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood insurgents in Hama in 1982. 
Today, parts of the ruling Ba’ath elite worry about Syria’s deepening alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah. 
That alliance reflects fear, not commitment. 
The moderate Sunni Gulf Arab emirates, suspicious of growing Shia ascendancy and of Iranian irredentism in the region, have stopped propping up Syria’s economy due to its alliance with the ayatollahs of Iran. 
Labelled by the US as part of the “axis of evil,” Syria has also seen Saudi financial aid dry up and fears that the trade benefits that would come with ratification of its Association Agreement with the EU will never materialize. 
Both Syria’s reluctant alliance with Iran, and its economic desperation, provide openings that Israel and the West should test. 
But what might Syria want? 
Like most Arabs, Bashar Al-Assad views Israel from the perspective of pan-Arab anguish at Palestinian dispossession, but also sees a chance to use the Palestinians to strengthen his regime’s power by putting his own imprint on any settlement. 
Like his father, Assad is cautious. 
So long as Egypt remains neutral, he is unlikely to risk another war with Israel, let alone a war with America or with America and Israel combined. 
The big puzzle is what Assad wants with Lebanon. 
If his aim is a government in Beirut that takes into account Syria’s genuine security concerns, Israel can live with that. 
Besides, widespread revulsion against Syria for its alleged role in the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, particularly among Lebanon’s Maronites, Sunnis, and Druze, means that Lebanon is unlikely to ever become totally subservient again – that is, unless Hezbollah gets to call the shots. 
Israel now faces three options. 
It can flinch while pretending not to; it can carry on more or less as before, hoping for some positive new development; or it can try to decouple Syria from Iran and Hezbollah. 
The latter option is the only scenario that could stop the Islamist drift in the Middle East. 
But prying Syria from Iran’s embrace means, eventually, reopening the Golan Heights question. 
A deal with Syria is not impossible, given the ambiguities in Assad’s position. 
On the Israeli/American side, it would include recognition that Syria has security interests in Lebanon. 
If Syria in turn accepts Lebanon’s sovereignty, and if it helps force Hezbollah into becoming a political force shorn of its military power, Israel and America ought to persuade Lebanon’s government to accept that Syria and Lebanon need to consult each other in security matters. 
For Syria, a peace deal would also include an understanding that Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights is to be settled by serious negotiation, not war. 
Such a diplomatic opening may be hard for Israel’s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, to accept, let alone to sell to Israelis. 
So America and Europe must help him reach this conclusion. 
America and Israel must drop their refusal to talk to Syria. 
Indeed, the time is ripe to offer assurances to the isolated Syrian regime that blocking Hezbollah’s rearmament, stopping Islamist fighters’ passage into Iraq, and improving the country’s appalling human rights record would bring valuable diplomatic and economic benefits, including a strengthened association agreement with the EU. 
Israel would gain much by talking to its enemy. 
Conscious of its vulnerability to rocket attacks, Israel knows that needs a defensible state, safe from external aggression. 
Removing Syria as a threat is a key element in achieving this strategic objective. 
The Road to Arab Democracy 
JERUSALEM – During the turmoil of the French Revolution, a popular saying arose: “How beautiful was the republic – under the monarchy.” 
Instead, it wrought for France – and much of Europe – Jacobin terror, right-wing counter-terror, decades of war, and eventually Napoleonic tyranny. 
A similar challenge now faces North Africa and the Middle East, where most Arab countries are experiencing massive upheavals. 
Historically speaking, what is now happening is without precedent in the Arab world. 
For the first time, Arab authoritarian regimes have been toppled, and others are threatened, by mass demonstrations calling for freedom and democracy. 
Previously, Arab regimes changed through military coups and other sorts of putsches, never through popular revolutions. 
During the great democratic wave of the 1990’s, which brought down dictatorships in Eastern Europe, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, nothing similar happened in Arab North Africa and the Middle East. 
Now, however, the region’s political inertia has been disrupted. 
Cairo’s Tahrir Square has become a symbol for both hope and “people power.” 
Yet, while most Arab regimes now appear threatened, only two authoritarian rulers – Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt – have been actually deposed so far. 
Theirs were relatively “soft” autocracies. 
Much more oppressive and ruthless rulers – Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, Bashar Assad in Syria, and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen – though seriously threatened, have proven far more resilient (up to now) in suppressing popular opposition. 
Even in tiny Bahrain, the Sunni minority has, for now, succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority, albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries. 
As always, it is easier to bring down an autocracy than to construct and consolidate a democratic regime. 
When communism in Eastern Europe collapsed, their old systems, despite some obvious differences, had the same characteristics: they were one-party dictatorships, with state control over the economy, education, and the media. 
Today, they are very different from each other. 
Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary, for example, succeeded in navigating a successful transition to democracy and a functioning market economy. 
Russia reverted to a neo-authoritarian system. 
The former Soviet republics in Central Asia have all developed various “sultanistic” forms of government. 
The reason for these differences is simple: democratic transition requires not only elections, but also several pre-conditions – a vibrant civil society; previous traditions, whether actual or remembered, of representation, pluralism, tolerance, and individualism; a limited role of religion; and an effective institutional framework for a multi-party system. 
Where these conditions exist, a transition to democracy can succeed; where they are missing, the chances – as in Russia – for a successful transition to a consolidated democracy are slim. 
Developments in Egypt will be crucial, not only because it is the largest Arab country, but also because some of the necessary pre-conditions appear to have a stronger presence there than elsewhere in the region. 
Yet, even in Egypt, the challenges are enormous. 
With early elections called for September, there is serious doubt as to whether opposition groups will have the time, means, and experience to organize effective political parties. 
At the moment, only the army – which has effectively ruled the country since 1952 – and the Muslim Brotherhood, which has the widest social networks, appear to be serious players. 
Will the army, whose monopoly of power is paradoxically legitimized by the massive demonstrations that toppled Mubarak, be willing to give up the enormous political and economic clout that it has amassed over decades? 
One hears about a possible modus vivendi between the army and the Muslim Brotherhood. 
Indeed, some activists are already back in Tahrir Square demonstrating against such an incongruous yet possible alliance. 
In Libya, if Qaddafi falls, can such a highly tribalized country possess the building blocks needed for a functioning democracy? 
The issue, one should emphasize, is not Islam as such: in Europe, the Catholic Church was for a long time the greatest enemy of democracy and liberalism. 
Yet Christian Democratic parties today are one of the pillars of European democracy. 
Like Christian churches, Islam can also change, and Indonesia and Turkey could well be examples for such a possibility. 
But a context in which a fundamentalist Islamic group like the Muslim Brotherhood is the strongest organization in society, with very little effective countervailing powers, creates a serious challenge. 
How will all of this influence the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which appears stuck? 
It may be difficult to know, especially as the fundamentalist Hamas, now in control of Gaza, might be encouraged by the rising power of its parent organization in Egypt. 
The recent escalation of violence along Gaza’s border with Israel does suggest that events are developing in a dangerous direction. 
As for Israel, it initially responded to the Arab revolts in a confused way. 
Now its leaders maintain that they would welcome democratic changes in the region as a guarantor of peace and common values, though they express skepticism about whether such developments are actually imminent. 
Skepticism is in order also with respect to the unknown consequences of Western military intervention in Libya: it may have been asked for by the Arab League and legitimized by the UN Security Council, yet the outcome is far from certain. 
Whatever happens in Libya will have repercussions across the region. 
The road to democracy has always been rocky – look at a century of upheavals in Europe and the difficulties the US faced when dealing with slavery and the rights of its black population. 
It is to be hoped that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel in the Arab Middle East as well, but the tunnel may be a long one. 
The Road to Depression 
BERKELEY – For 15 months, the United States Federal Reserve, assisted by the financial regulators of the US Treasury, have been trying to make the macroeconomic consequences of the American mortgage-backed securities financial crisis as small as possible – trying, above all, to avoid a deep depression. 
They have also had three subsidiary objectives: 
• Keep as much economic activity as possible under private-sector control, in order to ensure that what is produced is what consumers really want. 
• Prevent the princes of Wall Street who led us into the crisis from profiting from the systemic risk that they created. 
• Ensure that homeowners and small investors do not absorb too much loss, for their only “crime” was to accept bad risks, which they would not have done in a world of properly diversified portfolios. 
Now it is clear that the Fed and the Treasury have lost the game. 
If a depression is to be avoided, it will have to be the work of other arms of the government, with other tools and powers. 
The failure to contain the crisis will ultimately be traced, I think, to excessive concern with the first two subsidiary objectives: reining in Wall Street princes and keeping economic decision-making private. 
Had the Fed and the Treasury given those two objectives their proper – subsidiary – weight, I suspect that we would not now be in this mess, and that the danger of a global depression would still be very far away. 
The desire to prevent the princes of Wall Street from profiting from the crisis was reflected in the Fed-Treasury decision to let Lehman Brothers collapse in an uncontrolled bankruptcy without oversight, supervision, or guarantees. 
The logic behind that decision was that, previously in the crisis, equity shareholders had been severely punished when their firms were judged too big to fail. 
The shareholders of Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac essentially had ownership positions and all their wealth confiscated for pennies. 
But this was not true of bondholders and counterparties, who were paid in full. 
The Fed and Treasury feared that the lesson being taught in the last half of 2007 and the first half of 2008 was that the US government guaranteed all the debt and transactions of every bank and bank-like entity that was regarded as too big to fail. 
That, the Fed and the Treasury believed, could not be healthy. 
Lenders to very large overleveraged institutions had to have some incentive to calculate the risks. 
But that required, at some point, allowing some bank to fail, and persuading some debt holders and counterparties that the government guarantee of support to institutions that were too big to fail was not certain. 
In retrospect, this was a major mistake. 
The extended web of finance as it existed in the summer of 2008 was the result of millions of calculations that the US government did, in fact, guarantee the unsecured debt of every very large bank and bank-like entity in America. 
With that guarantee broken by Lehman Brothers’ collapse, every financial institution immediately sought to acquire a much greater capital cushion in order to avoid the need to draw on government support, but found it impossible to do so. 
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy created an extraordinary and immediate demand for additional bank capital, which the private sector could not supply. 
It was at this point that the Treasury made the second mistake. 
Because it tried to keep the private sector private, it sought to avoid partial or full nationalization of the components of the banking system deemed too big to fail. 
In retrospect, the Treasury should have identified all such entities and started buying common stock in them – whether they liked it or not – until the crisis passed. 
Yes, this is what might be called “lemon socialism,” creating grave dangers for corporate control, posing a threat of large-scale corruption, and establishing a precedent for intervention that could be very dangerous down the road. 
But would that have been worse than what we face now? 
The failure to sacrifice the subsidiary objective of keeping the private sector private meant that the Fed and the Treasury lost their opportunity to attain the principal objective of avoiding depression. 
Of course, hindsight is always easy. 
But if depression is to be avoided, it will be through old-fashioned Keynesian fiscal policy: the government must take a direct hand in boosting spending and deciding what goods and services will be in demand. 
The Road to Fiscal Crisis 
WASHINGTON, DC – It has become fashionable among Washington insiders – Democrats and Republicans alike – to throw up their hands and say: We ultimately face a major budget crisis in the United States, particularly as rising health-care costs increase the fiscal burden of entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid. 
But then the same people typically smile and point out that investors from other parts of the world still want to lend the US vast amounts of money, keeping long-term interest rates low and allowing the country to run big deficits for the foreseeable future. 
This view is seriously flawed. 
It implies that the US can kick the can down the road as long as the dollar remains the world’s preeminent reserve currency, and America offers the best safe haven for skittish capital owners. 
By 2015, according to this logic, politicians will have done nothing to raise taxes and very little to cut expenditure, so the US will still have a budget deficit of around $1 trillion, and will finance a substantial portion of it by selling government bonds to foreigners. 
By 2050, there will undoubtedly be a fiscal problem – but, again, there is plenty of time to ignore it. 
This logic, supported by the clear intention of the Federal Reserve to keep all interest rates low, suggests that benchmark US interest rates – for example, on the 10-year Treasury – will remain below 4% (and perhaps under 3.5%) in the near term. 
This week, such government debt paid around 3.2%, which is very low by historical standards. 
If the “Washington Fiscal Consensus” proves correct, when benchmark rates eventually edge upwards, they will move slowly. 
But this consensus misses an important point: the financial sector in the US and globally has become much more unstable in recent decades, and there is nothing in any of the reform efforts undertaken since the near-meltdown in 2008 that will make it safer. 
People sometimes talk about “systemic risk” as if it were intrinsic to the financial system. But modern financial history, including in emerging markets, strongly indicates otherwise. 
When banks and other financial institutions get into trouble, private losses are transferred – explicitly or implicitly – to the government’s balance sheet. Dangerous financial systems pose big fiscal risks. 
The three people who have articulated this problem most clearly include two of the world’s leading central bankers. 
Before Ben Bernanke became Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, he was rightly renowned for his academic work on the Great Depression, which showed how, under the right (or wrong) conditions, the financial sector could act as a form of accelerant for developments in the real (nonfinancial) economy. 
The Fed’s efforts in the past three years to stabilize banks and other parts of finance have no doubt been motivated in large part by this insight. 
Anat Admati, a professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, focuses on bank capital – specifically, the incentives that banks have to fund their activities with very high leverage – little equity and a great deal of debt. 
In my view, she has the single most important page on the Web today (http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/admati.etal.mediamentions.html), containing both original research by her, Peter deMarzo, Martin Hellwig, and Paul Pfleiderer and their many interventions in the policy debate. 
The insight of Admati and her collaborators is simple and very powerful. 
Higher leverage allows bankers to earn more money, but it can easily become excessive for shareholders – because it makes the banks more vulnerable to collapse – and it is terrible for taxpayers and all citizens, as they face massive downside costs. 
In the US, the costs include more than eight million jobs lost since 2007, an increase in government debt relative to GDP of around 40% (mostly due to lost tax revenue), and much more. 
Mervyn King, a former academic who is currently Governor of the Bank of England, and his colleagues have a vivid name for the toxic cocktail that results: “doom loop.” 
The idea is that every time the financial system is in trouble, it receives a great deal of support from central banks and government budgets. 
This limits losses to stockholders and completely protects almost all creditors. 
As a result, banks have even stronger incentives to resume heavy borrowing (as Admati argues), and, as rising asset prices lift the economy in the recovery phase, it becomes possible for them to borrow even more (as Bernanke knows). But what this really amounts to is taking on more risk, typically in an unregulated, unsupervised way – and with very little effective governance within the banks themselves (again, Admati explains why bank executives like it this way). 
The Bernanke-Admati-King view suggests that the Washington Fiscal Consensus is seriously deficient. 
The US and global economy will recover, to be sure. 
But that recovery will be just another phase in the boom-bust-bailout cycle. 
America’s too-big-to-fail banks are well on their way to becoming too big to save. 
That point will be reached when saving the big banks, protecting their creditors, and stabilizing the economy plunges the US government so deeply into debt that its solvency is called into question, interest rates rise sharply, and a fiscal crisis erupts. 
In other words, the “doom loop” isn’t really a loop at all. 
It does end eventually, as it has – just for starters – in Iceland, Ireland, and Greece. 
The Road to Justice in Iraq 
As questions continue to mount concerning the true rationale behind the Iraq war, we should avoid only looking backwards. 
Examining the US-led coalition's prewar actions may well expose official deception and manipulation in making the case for military intervention. 
But the nagging questions about the campaign's legitimacy lie less in the past, and more in the ongoing absence of virtually any semblance of the rule of law in Iraq. 
Today, the domestic security vacuum in Iraq is so profound that it calls into question whether the war is really over. 
Guerrilla attacks on coalition soldiers show that no neat line separates ``before'' and ``after.'' 
So does the disturbing continuity between the absence of legality prior to the occupation and now, under the formal authority of the occupying powers. 
After all, it is the rule of law--and only the rule of law--that distinguishes free societies from dictatorships. 
Coalition military officials recognize the obvious: without proof of Saddam Hussein's demise, resistance by his hardcore supporters would inevitably continue. 
But what about the need for a wider reckoning with the former regime? 
Is justice for the victims and perpetrators of Saddam's crimes any less important for separating Iraq's past from the present and the future? 
So far, security and law enforcement have been utterly inadequate to deal with past abuses. 
Given decades of repressive rule, and tens of thousands of disappeared Iraqis, there are already endemic problems of verification. 
But from the outset of the intervention, coalition officials have displayed patent disregard for mass graves and massacre sites. 
Chaotic excavation and exhumation--often by family members desperate to learn the fate of loved ones--and unprofessional treatment of the evidence aggravates the challenges of uncovering the truth. 
Unfortunately, the coalition's neglect of forensic issues reflects its wider failure to devise any strategy to address issues concerning the rule of law and justice, or any central body with the authority to begin building the necessary institutions. 
While US Chief Administrator Paul Bremer recently vested authority in a number of judges, their powers are extremely limited, and apply only to present violations, not the sustained abuses of human rights that defined Saddam's regime. 
With weapons of mass destruction nowhere to be found, the justice of this intervention remains an open question--one that now turns on the coalition's efforts to establish the rudiments of legality in Iraq. 
These efforts will succeed only if they include a modicum of transitional justice. 
As the occupation force in Iraq, the coalition has undertaken international obligations, under the fourth Geneva convention, to uphold security and the rule of law. 
This means that the coalition cannot do whatever it wishes with Saddam's henchmen and war criminals. 
It cannot simply ship them to Guantanamo Bay or Diego Garcia. 
But the coalition's choices are extremely limited. 
Appointing an Iraqi tribunal capable of generating some form of legal accountability for Saddam and his henchmen--an idea that is gaining ground among Bremer's staff, at least for Saddam Hussein if he is captured alive--is unrealistic. 
No one is fully legitimate: neither those who thoroughly compromised themselves serving the Ba'athist judiciary, nor exile returnees. 
Similarly, the coalition would inevitably face the charge of ``victor's justice'' were it to administer and staff its own courts. 
Only the UN can meet the demand for transitional justice. 
This requires the immediate establishment of a judicial body, whose legitimacy would be based on the same multilateral process that was sought prior to the war. 
In this case, Chapter 7 of the UN charter gives the Security Council authority to set up criminal tribunals, as it did previously to adjudicate massacres in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. 
Unlike the UN tribunal for former Yugoslavia, which was established during the Balkan wars, a tribunal for Iraq would be more constrained by the need to avoid applying justice retroactively. 
As a result, the UN Iraqi court's jurisdiction would extend only to the gravest violations of humanitarian law, on which there is a broad consensus, as set forth in Article 3 of the charter of the International Criminal Court. 
But even such limited action is better than doing nothing. 
We know from the many cases of regime change in recent decades that the problem of transitional justice will not merely go away if ignored. 
Indeed, inaction in Iraq will not only postpone the inevitable reckoning with the past; it may prolong the past, as unfulfilled demands for justice fuel frustration, resentment, and support for extremist leaders and authoritarian solutions. 
One of the main purposes of pursuing transitional justice is to reestablish legitimacy and the rule of law in the present. 
If the necessary institutions remain unavailable, then at the least an investigative commission should be created to establish an evidentiary record while this is still possible. 
Such a commission would afford a measure of preservative justice, enabling a more comprehensive verdict once the institutional capacity for achieving this is built. 
There is still a chance to create a ``before'' and ``after'' in Iraq, and hence to redeem the legitimacy of the US-led intervention and ongoing occupation. 
But the path lies before us, not behind us, in a sustained commitment to security, the rule of law, and transitional justice. 
The Road to Nuclear Disarmament 
NEW YORK – Weapons of mass destruction and disarmament form one of the gravest challenges facing the world. 
One of my priorities as United Nations Secretary-General is to promote global public goods and remedies to challenges that do not respect borders. 
A world free of nuclear weapons is a global public good of the highest order. 
My interest in this subject stems partly from personal experience. 
My homeland, South Korea, has suffered the ravages of conventional war and faced threats from nuclear weapons and other WMD. 
But, of course, such threats are not unique to Asia. 
Despite a longstanding taboo against using nuclear weapons, disarmament remains only an aspiration. 
So, is a taboo merely on the use of such weapons sufficient? 
States make the key decisions where nuclear weapons are concerned. 
But the UN has important roles to play. 
We provide a central forum in which states can agree on norms to serve their common interests. 
We analyze, educate, and advocate in the pursuit of agreed goals. 
Most states have chosen to forgo nuclear weapons, and have complied with their commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
Yet some states view such weapons as a status symbol, and some view them as offering the ultimate deterrent against nuclear attack, which largely accounts for the estimated 26,000 that still exist. 
Unfortunately, the doctrine of nuclear deterrence is contagious, making non-proliferation more difficult and raising new risks that nuclear weapons will be used. 
The world remains concerned about nuclear activities in North Korea and Iran, and there is widespread support for efforts to address these concerns by peaceful means. 
There are also concerns that a “nuclear renaissance” is looming, with nuclear energy seen as a clean energy alternative at a time of intensifying efforts to combat climate change. 
The main worry is that this will lead to the production and use of more nuclear materials that must be protected against proliferation and terrorist threats. 
The obstacles to disarmament are formidable. 
But the costs and risks of its alternatives never get the attention they deserve. 
Consider the enormous opportunity cost of huge military budgets. 
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military expenditures last year exceeded $1.3 trillion. 
Ten years ago, the Brookings Institution published a study that estimated the total costs of nuclear weapons in the United States alone to be over $5.8 trillion, including future cleanup costs. 
By any definition, this is a huge investment that could have had many other productive uses. 
Concerns over nuclear weapons’ costs and inherent dangers have led to a global outpouring of ideas to breathe new life into nuclear disarmament. 
We have seen the WMD Commission led by Hans Blix, the New Agenda Coalition, and Norway’s Seven Nation Initiative. 
Australia and Japan have launched the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. 
Civil society groups and nuclear-weapon states have also made proposals, such as the Hoover Plan, spearheaded by Henry Kissinger. 
I would like to offer my own five-point proposal. 
First, I urge all NPT parties, in particular the nuclear-weapon states, to fulfill their obligation under the treaty to undertake negotiations on effective measures leading to nuclear disarmament. 
They could agree on a framework of separate, mutually reinforcing instruments. 
Or they could consider negotiating a nuclear-weapons convention, backed by a strong verification system, as has long been proposed at the UN. 
I have circulated to all UN members a draft of such a convention, which offers a good point of departure. 
The nuclear powers should actively engage with other states on this issue at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. 
The world would also welcome a resumption of bilateral negotiations between the US and Russia aimed at deep and verifiable reductions of their arsenals. 
Governments should also invest more in verification research and development. 
The United Kingdom’s proposal to host a conference of nuclear-weapon states on verification is a concrete step in the right direction. 
Second, the Security Council’s permanent members should begin discussions on security issues in the nuclear disarmament process. 
They could unambiguously assure non-nuclear-weapon states that they will not be subject to the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons. 
The Council could also convene a summit on nuclear disarmament. 
Non-NPT states should freeze their own nuclear-weapon capabilities and make their own disarmament commitments. 
Third, unilateral moratoria on nuclear tests and the production of fissile materials can go only so far. 
We need new efforts to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into force, and for the Conference on Disarmament to begin negotiations on a fissile material treaty immediately, without preconditions. 
I support the creation of the Central Asian and African nuclear-weapon-free zones, and strongly support efforts to establish such a zone in the Middle East. 
And I urge all NPT parties to conclude their safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and voluntarily to adopt the strengthened safeguards under the Additional Protocol. 
Fourth, the nuclear-weapon states often circulate descriptions of what they are doing to pursue these goals. 
But these accounts seldom reach the public. 
I invite the nuclear-weapon states to send such material to the UN Secretariat, and to encourage its wider dissemination. 
The lack of an authoritative estimate of the total number of nuclear weapons attests to the need for greater transparency. 
Finally, a number of complementary measures are needed. 
These include eliminating other types of WMD; new efforts against WMD terrorism; limits on the production and trade in conventional arms; and new weapons bans, including of missiles and space weapons. 
If there is real, verified progress on disarmament, the ability to eliminate the nuclear threat will grow exponentially. 
As we progressively eliminate the world’s deadliest weapons and their components, we will make it harder to execute WMD terrorist attacks. 
The Road to Post-Crisis Growth 
MILAN – It is about 18 months since the financial crisis hit, and 12 months since the panic started to recede, with asset prices stabilizing and beginning to turn up. 
Although recovery in advanced countries remains fragile, developing countries appear to have weathered the storm. 
Growth in China and India is bouncing back toward pre-crisis levels, Brazil’s growth is rising after a sharp dip, and developing-country trade is rebounding from depressed levels. 
Reasons for this remarkable resilience abound, and they offer guidance for advanced and developing countries alike. 
As the crisis struck, capital flowed out of developing countries to shore up damaged balance sheets in advanced countries. 
Credit tightened sharply. 
But rapid responses by developing-country central banks, in collaboration with relatively healthy domestic banks, prevented a severe credit freeze. 
Moreover, the reserves built up over the preceding decade were, in many cases, used to offset some of the capital outflows. 
Bank balance sheets had been strengthened after the 1997-1998 financial crisis, and were unencumbered by the overvalued securitized assets and complex derivative securities that caused much of the damage to advanced-country financial institutions. 
Leverage was lower in several sectors. 
Financial institutions – and, more importantly, households – held less debt relative to assets and income. 
In advanced economies, the main mechanisms for transmitting balance-sheet damage to the real economy were credit rationing and reduced consumption due to loss of net worth in households. 
Both factors were more muted in developing economies. 
Of course, rapid declines in asset values had an impact for a few months, but, with less leverage, the impact on net worth was lower and domestic consumption less vulnerable. 
In sum, the crisis originated in a balance-sheet shock, to which exposure was simply lower in developing countries. 
All developing countries witnessed a huge fall-off in trade – much larger than the declines in income and output. 
Trade bounced back relatively quickly in the second half of 2009, though this partly reflected the extraordinarily low base. 
But the immediate effect was mitigated to some extent by a sharp depreciation of almost all the currencies caused by the capital outflows. 
The exception was China, where the renminbi held steady against the dollar, causing an initial appreciation against almost every other currency. 
That configuration has largely reversed in the past nine months as international capital flows, driven by investment opportunities and returns, return to a more normal pattern. 
It is likely that China will shortly resume its pre-crisis policy of managed appreciation. 
To be sure, developing countries differed – often markedly – in their capacity for fiscal stimulus to counter the loss of external demand. 
Nevertheless, many were capable of at least some countercyclical measures without destabilizing their public finances. 
Although the resilience in emerging markets, their rapid and effective policy responses, and speedy recoveries are encouraging signs for the global economy, instability in the advanced economies and the relatively unregulated financial system remain a cause for concern. 
Re-regulation and international efforts to coordinate policy responses may eventually reduce the potential for instability, but will require the work to be finished and tested before real confidence is generated. 
In the meantime, a somewhat conservative and defensive posture is warranted. 
This means that developing countries are likely to retain substantial domestic ownership of their domestic financial institutions. 
Securitization (and shadow banking) will be kept simple and proceed at a measured pace as a new legal and regulatory framework is built and tested. 
Complex securities that are hard to value will be sharply limited as a matter of policy. 
Moreover, because dependence on foreign finance creates clear vulnerabilities, developing countries will seek to fund investment mainly from domestic savings, thereby limiting the size of their current-account deficits. 
And, because there is no strategic reason to run large surpluses, with an excess of savings over investment, maintaining reasonable balance on the current account appears to be the preferred course. 
In any case, limiting financial interdependence is the prudent strategy and the likely outcome. 
Nevertheless, the basic pillar of sustained high growth has been leveraging the global economy’s knowledge and demand. 
That remains valid. 
So, while a strong likelihood of diminished growth in advanced countries for an extended period means that an outward-oriented strategy may produce less-than-spectacular results for developing countries, alternative strategies are worse. 
Indeed, worries about rising protectionism in a low-growth environment are on target. 
Larger developing countries must assume an expanded role in unwinding the protectionist measures that came with their expanded use of the public purse, and reestablish forward motion. 
This is particularly important for poorer and smaller developing countries in which domestic consumption and investment is a poor substitute for global demand. 
At the same time, a renewed emphasis on maximizing the domestic market’s potential to drive growth and structural diversification – though clearly higher in the larger, higher-income developing economies – is a useful lesson of the crisis. 
Those developing countries that maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, a countercyclical mindset, and steady progress on governance, education, and infrastructure will thrive. 
Advanced-country growth may be diminished for a time, but the compensating factors that have emerged represent the most important lesson of the crisis. 
Developing countries’ internal trade is expanding with their economic size, and the large ones are restoring growth rapidly. 
Indeed, China, far from being thrown off course by the crisis, is entering a middle-income transition that over time will create considerable space in labor-intensive manufacturing and services, as the country evolves structurally and exits from these sectors. 
The Road to Post-War Recovery 
For the world’s advanced countries, a key challenge is to broaden economic and social inclusion without diminishing the economic dynamism they already have. . 
The problems of war-ravaged countries are far more acute and their choices much more constrained. 
Indeed, they confront a double challenge: to create dynamic economies and to promote, at the same time, economic and social inclusion. 
Without both of these elements, national reconciliation will likely prove impossible. 
Social exclusion in industrial countries imposes costs throughout society that policymakers must address with effective and targeted measures. 
Lack of jobs, for example, often leads people, particularly the young, away from work and into dependency on drugs and crime. 
Society, then , needs to pay for the costs of crime prevention policies and the administration of justice. 
A flexible labor market, as many suggest, will not in itself promote inclusion. 
Welfare programs in war-ravaged countries often aggravate joblessness by reducing work incentives and creating a culture of dependency. 
Minimum-wage laws and labor agreements often make the least productive workers unaffordable to law-abiding employers. 
So what these countries need are more employment opportunities and higher salaries in the private sector for these workers. 
Specifically, a wage subsidy program that lowers the cost of hiring full-time unskilled workers could make it more attractive for firms to hire them. 
At the same time, on-the-job training would make the program attractive to workers and to society as a whole. 
Governments could afford the cost of the subsidies since cutting unemployment would not only lower public security costs, but would also reduce the need for welfare programs. 
In countries coming out of war or other conflicts, efforts at inclusion are futile in stagnant economies. 
Without both dynamism and inclusion, the path to peace will be elusive, as recent experiences in Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan, Iraq, and many countries in Africa illustrate. 
Thus, post-war transitions require that policies that encourage dynamism and inclusion go hand in hand. 
Economic recovery needs to begin as soon as possible, not only because this is essential to maintaining political and social stability, but also because donors are unwilling to support economic reconstruction unless countries do their part to create an environment conducive to ensuring its sustainability. 
In the midst of political, social, and institutional vulnerabilities, as well as the vast damage to human and physical infrastructure that are the legacy of conflict, this is a monumental task. 
Policymaking in these war torn economies is unique. 
Most countries in post-conflict situations suffer from weak fiscal positions, rendering the provision of internally financed subsidies impractical in most cases. 
Moreover, foreign assistance, while stable in “normal” developing countries, often exhibits sharp spikes in countries undergoing war-to-peace transitions. 
In many cases, post-conflict aid can reach extraordinarily high levels after the conflicts ends, both in per capita terms and relative to the size of the recipient economies. 
Typically, however, this type of aid declines very rapidly. 
Low-income countries in the normal process of development, for example, receive steady inflows of official foreign assistance of about 3% of their gross national income. 
By contrast, aid reached 95% of gross national income in Rwanda soon after the conflict ended, but fell to 20% within five years. 
Consolidating peace following violent conflict has little chance of success unless jobs are created and the economy is quickly stabilized and brought onto a path of investment and growth with low inflation. 
The United Nations reckons that if economic reconstruction fails in terms of promoting dynamism and inclusion, countries in the transition to peace have an even chance of reverting to war. 
Leaving aside the cost in terms of human lives, the economic costs of maintaining peace are but a fraction of what would be required for humanitarian assistance, military intervention, and peacekeeping operations should the country relapse into conflict. 
Hence, effective financing for peacetime is a good investment of donors’ resources and a major factor in conflict prevention. 
But donors need to avoid some common mistakes. 
In many cases, economic reconstruction has failed partly because donors required that their own nationals or companies be used. 
This policy has often led to programs that countries do not want and to employment of foreign experts for tasks that nationals could and should have performed. 
By providing domestic firms with wage subsidies for hiring unskilled workers, donors would increase the effectiveness and fairness of their assistance in support of national-led reconstruction and conflict prevention. 
Given lower labor costs, local businessmen could decide to invest under the conditions of uncertainty and high risk that characterize post-conflict situations. 
The advantages in terms of employment creation, reintegrating former combatants into productive activities, savings from safety-net programs, and improved public security would be many. 
This type of aid would also provide political support for the authorities from a population grateful for policies that promote job creation. 
At the same time, this policy would have neither the fiscal cost associated with government-financed subsidies, nor the distortions caused by the difficulty of cutting subsidies once the government has offered them. 
Grant-supported subsidies would remain in place for a finite period, and donors would gradually phase them out as aid programs expire. 
Furthermore, such subsidies would help reactivate the private sector, which is essential as large-scale post-conflict aid withers to the low levels that are common under conditions of normal development. 
The Road to Prosperity and Sound Markets 
BERLIN – The near global financial meltdown and ensuing downturns left the Anglo-Saxon nations pondering what they should do both to set their economies on a path toward recovery and to avoid a similar crisis in the future. 
Some recommendations by members of Columbia University’s Center on Capitalism and Society were sent to last April’s G20 meeting. 
To create more jobs in the economy, I proposed that governments establish a class of banks that would acquire the lost art of financing investment projects in the business sector – the type of financing the old “merchant” banks did so well a century ago. 
I also renewed my support for a subsidy to companies for their ongoing employment of low-wage workers. 
(Singapore adopted this idea with enviable results.) 
To protect commercial banks from risking their own solvency (and the whole country’s solvency besides) once again, Richard Robb suggested that a small tax on banks’ short-term debts be imposed in order to deter banks from over-borrowing. 
Amar Bhide suggested that commercial banks return to “narrow banking.” 
If they did that, they could not borrow at all. 
But despite all the policy action and talk since then, none of these suggestions has been adopted by G20 countries. 
Their emphasis has been on countercyclical measures intended to moderate the downturn rather than on restructuring. 
Such moderation, taken alone, is welcome, of course. 
But the measures taken may be delaying recovery. 
Much of the fiscal “stimulus” to consumers causes companies to hang onto employees a little longer rather than to release them to export and import-competing industries that are expanding. 
Much of the stimulus to homeowners is propping up housing prices at unsustainable levels. 
This is slowing the absorption into the economy of the excess resources in the construction industry. 
Another round of global stimulus after the downturn is over or nearly so would push world interest rates up and drive investment activity down. 
Government initiatives to rebuild “infrastructure” – to replace waning private investment with state investment in health care, climate control and energy conservation – do not have that downside. 
But as a means to job creation there are questions. 
Private investment is sustained by private innovation, which renews good opportunities. 
But would good opportunities for state investment be similarly renewed? 
Might the uncertainties raised by entering into such unknown territory exact a serious toll on private investment activity? 
Governments must shake off the delusion that full recovery is just a matter of pushing buttons. 
Beginning with the astonishingly innovative economies that sprouted up in the 19th century, the tried and true method for gaining high prosperity – for an ample supply of engaging and challenging jobs – has been a system of innovative private enterprise in the business sector. 
What governments ought to do is “stimulate” an innovative economy, not endless roads, wind energy and other building projects. 
The best way to shorten the downturn is to restructure the economy in such ways that it recovers to a higher “new normal” level. 
This December, the Center on Capitalism and Society is meeting in Berlin, just weeks after commemorations of the fall of the Berlin wall. 
The meeting is intended to seek ways to streamline and buttress complex and stumbling economies so that they possess the dynamism that delivers high prosperity – plentiful jobs and ample job satisfaction. 
Not all the instruments for creating that prosperity are known, of course. 
Yet many are. 
It is good to have a banking industry run by a diversity of canny financiers capable of recognizing and willing to fund innovative investment projects. 
It is good to have a business sector in which shareowners are not prey to self-dealing CEOs. 
It is bad to have fund managers that dump a company’s shares if it does not hit its earnings targets for the next quarter. 
Yet the goal of high dynamism raises a problem. 
Markets, being peopled by mere human beings, have trouble figuring out where profitable investment opportunities are (let alone the most profitable). 
A company’s knowledge of the future results of a new business undertaking is imperfect to say the least. 
And the more innovative the undertaking the more imperfect is any advance understanding of its potential outcome. 
An investor’s knowledge of the results of a decision to buy this or that asset, financial or real, is likewise imperfect. 
Moreover, what others think – particularly, what rivals are doing – may have a big effect on the results of a decision and much of what others understand and plan is private, thus inaccessible. 
So an economy’s dynamism depends on enough people daring to act in spite of how little they know. 
Those of us who, at the Berlin conference and elsewhere, seek to rebuild economies for greater dynamism must do so with awareness of these economic realities. 
The market’s magic powers are limited. 
Fortunately, there are some policy precepts and ideas that governments would do well to invest their political capital in if they want innovation and its attendant prosperity to resume. 
A time-honored precept is to avoid shaking investor confidence unnecessarily. 
When John Maynard Keynes went to see President Roosevelt in the depths of the Depression, he advised toning down the administration’s anti-business rhetoric. 
Yet governments must also avoid pumping up businesses with over-confidence, which could tempt them to raise mark-ups and hurt sales. 
Simplifying financial institutions, especially those with an implicit government backstop, must also play a role in rebuilding a dynamic economy. 
Ratings that pretend to take into account “systemic risk” might prove as dangerous as ratings that ignore such risk. 
Hedge funds, venture capital firms that actually venture into new things, and recreated merchant banks are relatively well suited to make financial decisions that require judgment, the ability to engage the unknown, and to do so over a horizon not dictated by quarterly earnings. 
There are also ideas to address speculative swings. 
They may induce wasteful investment and a loss in innovation. 
Their “corrections” may also have costs – a business slump and a further loss of innovation. 
A conceptual framework – Imperfect Knowledge Economics – recently developed by a Center member, Roman Frydman, in collaboration with Michael Goldberg, shows how excessive swings in asset prices arise from market participants’ imperfect understanding of the future rewards of their decisions. 
This framework provides a rationale for policy intervention in asset markets, and also has important implications for how regulators should measure and manage systemic financial risk. 
The analysis acknowledges that, within a wide range, the market does a far better (though not perfect) job in setting prices than regulators could. 
But it makes the case for novel measures, including “guidance ranges” for asset prices and targeted variation of margin and capital requirements, to help dampen such excessive price movements. 
Regaining a well-functioning capitalism may be a steep mountain to climb. 
The Road to the Double Helix, the Structure of DNA 
Fifty years ago, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine Nature . 
It described a remarkable two-chain helical structure for DNA--the genetic material in living organisms. 
Their double-helix model provided the key to understanding how living cells can produce two exact copies of themselves and how genetic material stores all the information for synthesizing the proteins needed to build a living organism. 
A second major advance came a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin. 
Since then, X-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has helped us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions. 
Both discoveries--DNA structure and protein structure--were made at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory. 
So why were these two foundation stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of the 20th century uncovered in a British physics lab? 
The great breakthroughs of 1953 rested on the strength of experimental physics at Cambridge, beginning in the late 19th century. 
This legacy shaped the intellectual environment in which the father-and-son team of William and Lawrence Bragg were trained, and where Lawrence Bragg--first as an undergraduate and then as a research student--developed in 1912 the ideas that led to X-ray structural analysis. 
Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich, and Paul Knipping had discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, it was Lawrence Bragg who understood how it could be exploited scientifically. 
Reflection by "Bragg planes"--sheets of atoms that can diffract X-rays at specific angles that are determined by the separation between sheets--enabled the Braggs to calculate the exact arrangement of sodium and chloride atoms in a crystal of salt. 
William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884, and became professor of physics in Adelaide, Australia. 
In 1909 he returned to Britain to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays. 
He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he attracted some outstanding young scientists interested in the X-ray field. 
Among them were two recent Cambridge graduates, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of protein structure--Astbury as a result of being asked by Bragg to provide X-ray diagrams of wool and silk. 
Bernal moved back to Cambridge as a lecturer in structural crystallography in 1927, and in 1931 was promoted to assistant director of research in crystallography, by then a sub-department of the Cavendish Laboratory. 
Bernal's main scientific interest was initially the atomic structure of crystals, metals, and minerals, then of hormones and sterols--and of some amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. 
Astbury, meanwhile, moved to Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins. 
Describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain well-ordered X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals of the protein pepsin, he wondered whether Bernal could help obtain crystals of other proteins. 
A friend of Bernal's named Glenn Millikan had happened to visit a lab in Uppsala, Sweden, where large pepsin crystals had been obtained, and he brought some of the crystals, still in their mother-liquor, back to Cambridge. 
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) obtained patterns of the dry crystals, as Astbury had, and with similarly disappointing results. 
But when Bernal observed the crystals in a light microscope, he noticed that as the large amount of water in the crystal lattice evaporated, they became disordered. 
They repeated the X-ray experiment, but with the crystal surrounded by its mother-liquor and sealed in a glass capillary, obtaining patterns with large numbers of crystalline reflections. 
The results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published as a letter in Nature in 1934. 
Having deduced the presence of polypeptide chains, Astbury continued to pursue his pioneering studies of their configurations in fibrous proteins. 
He also obtained the first X-ray patterns of partially oriented samples of DNA. 
Max Perutz, a chemistry graduate from Vienna, arrived in Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal. 
The next year, he was given excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best X-ray diffraction patterns to date. 
But the observable diffraction pattern--the intensities and positions of the individual reflections--represents only half of the data needed to deduce the structure of the diffracting object. 
In mathematical terms, it gives the amplitude, but not the phases--i.e., the stages in an oscillatory motion--without which the atomic positions could not be determined. 
With simpler structures made up of small numbers of atoms, chemistry could provide considerable guidance as to the atomic arrangements, and a solution could thus often be found by trial and error. 
But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work. 
So despite the enormous amount of excellent data that was collected, the solution remained tantalizingly out of reach. 
But the faith remained that detailed information about protein structure could be obtained from the X-ray patterns in some way, if only it could be discovered. 
It was only natural that where chemistry fell short, physics--and its premier laboratory--showed the way forward, a way grasped by Watson and Crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this month. 
The Road to Tripoli 
BENGHAZI – In the days since the February 17 revolution against Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, opposition forces in Benghazi have formed a Transitional National Council (TNC) and a Crisis Team (CT) to serve as an interim government. 
The two groups are drawn from a cross-section of society. 
Some members held senior posts in Qaddafi’s government; others were social activists. 
Both groups are now quite popular among the population in rebel-controlled parts of Libya. 
But if rebel troops are unable to advance toward the capital of Tripoli, and instead remain deadlocked with Qaddafi’s forces between the towns of Ajdabiyya and Brega, the opposition will face a serious dilemma. 
A military impasse could erode their support and even delegitimize them. 
When forming the councils, the opposition sought to achieve a balance between government experience, technical expertise, and tribal support. 
Thus, while some members, such as former Justice Minister and TNC Chairman Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, were affiliated with Qaddafi’s government, others, such as CT Economic and Finance chief Ali Tarhouni, have lived outside of Libya for almost 30 years. 
And powerful clans from Tobruk have succeeded in placing their members in key military positions. 
The councils are, moreover, largely a regional affair, with members mostly coming from eastern Libya. 
Those with roots in the western regions are mainly dissidents who have lived abroad for decades. 
TNC officials admit that some council members are based in western Libya, but have refused to identify them for security reasons. 
The two bodies are far from uniform and monolithic. 
Conflicts have already erupted between TNC members as well as between members of the military leadership. 
Bolstered by his high profile as Justice Minister, Jalil has emerged as an interim leader. 
But once the TNC makes the transition toward becoming an elected body, the more charismatic CT Director Mahmoud Jibril and the astute council spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga may emerge as the rebels’ true leaders. 
On the military side, simmering tensions between two officers are frustrating combat strategy. 
Colonel Khalifa Hifter, a close Qaddafi supporter before he deserted following his capture by Chadian forces in 1987 during Libya’s war with its southern neighbor, has proved unwilling to fall into line behind the chief of staff, former Interior Minister Abdul Fatah Younis. 
Such political and military spats are likely to continue as officials attempt to consolidate their positions. 
The two groups are hard-pressed to formulate a clear political and social platform. 
TNC and CT members are largely unified in their desire to end Qaddafi’s 41-year rule and redistribute the country’s wealth to the country’s long-neglected eastern region. 
As a result, they have not articulated a coherent vision of a post-Qaddafi Libya. And, though the two councils are certainly staffed by people with the technical credentials needed to manage the economy, few members have any real political skills or experience overseeing bureaucratic bodies. 
So far, these shortcomings have not prevented the TNC from achieving widespread support in the rebel-controlled east. 
Inhabitants of Benghazi praise Abdul Jalil and his colleagues. 
Municipal councils in Bayda, Darna, and Tobruk have pledged their support for the TNC, and fighters who battled American forces in Iraq have lined up behind the body’s military leaders. 
People here are content to be free from Qaddafi’s erratic policies and pervasive security services. 
“Anyone but Qaddafi,” one man in Tobruk told me. 
This partly explains why Libyans are willing to embrace dissidents who lived abroad for decades, about whom they know little. 
This warm welcome contrasts with Iraqi distrust of the political exiles who returned on the coattails of the American overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. 
But support for the TNC is largely skin deep – it is neither grounded in knowledge of how the opaque council functions, nor based on an understanding of its goals. 
As such, once the initial euphoria dissipates, Libyans are likely to turn against the TNC if it cannot deliver battlefield successes. 
With the rebels lacking professional military training and discipline, such gains look increasingly unlikely. 
To ensure that the rebels have a fighting chance against Qaddafi’s better-equipped troops, Western countries will have to move beyond air strikes and offering the TNC diplomatic recognition. 
They will need to provide medium-range rockets and light armored vehicles to anti-regime forces, in addition to training them to use their weapons properly. 
The Rocky Road to Recovery 
NEW YORK – A consensus now exists that America’s recession – already a year old – is likely to be long and deep, and that almost all countries will be affected. 
I always thought that the notion that what happened in America would be decoupled from the rest of the world was a myth. 
Events are showing that to be so. 
Fortunately, America has, at last, a president with some understanding of the nature and severity of the problem, and who has committed himself to a strong stimulus program. 
This, together with concerted action by governments elsewhere, will mean that the downturn will be less severe than it otherwise would be. 
The United States Federal Reserve, which helped create the problems through a combination of excessive liquidity and lax regulation, is trying to make amends – by flooding the economy with liquidity, a move that, at best, has merely prevented matters from being worse. 
It’s not surprising that those who helped create the problems and didn’t see the disaster coming have not done a masterly job in dealing with it. 
By now, the dynamics of the downturn are set, and things will get worse before they get better. 
In some ways, the Fed resembles a drunk driver who, suddenly realizing that he is heading off the road starts careening from side to side. 
The response to the lack of liquidity is ever more liquidity. 
When the economy starts recovering, and banks start lending, will they be able to drain the liquidity smoothly out of the system? 
Will America face a bout of inflation? 
Or, more likely, in another moment of excess, will the Fed over-react, nipping the recovery in the bud? 
Given the unsteady hand exhibited so far, we cannot have much confidence in what awaits us. 
Still, I am not sure that there is sufficient appreciation of some of the underlying problems facing the global economy, without which the current global recession is unlikely to give way to robust growth – no matter how good a job the Fed does. 
For a long time, the US has played an important role in keeping the global economy going. 
America’s profligacy – the fact that the world’s richest country could not live within its means – was often criticized. 
But perhaps the world should be thankful, because without American profligacy, there would have been insufficient global aggregate demand. 
In the past, developing countries filled this role, running trade and fiscal deficits. 
But they paid a high price, and fiscal responsibility and conservative monetary policies are now the fashion. 
Indeed, many developing countries, fearful of losing their economic sovereignty to the IMF – as occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis – accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves. 
Money put into reserves is income not spent. 
Moreover, growing inequality in most countries of the world has meant that money has gone from those who would spend it to those who are so well off that, try as they might, they can’t spend it all. 
The world’s unending appetite for oil, beyond its ability or willingness to produce, has contributed a third factor. 
Rising oil prices transferred money to oil-rich countries, again contributing to the flood of liquidity. 
Though oil prices have been dampened for now, a robust recovery could send them soaring again. 
For a while, people spoke almost approvingly of the flood of liquidity. 
But this was just the flip side of what Keynes had worried about – insufficient global aggregate demand. 
The search for return contributed to the reckless leverage and risk taking that underlay this crisis. 
America’s government will, for a time, partly make up for the increasing savings of US consumers. 
But if America’s consumers go from their near zero savings to a modest 4% or 5% of GDP, then the depressing effect on demand (in addition to that resulting from declines in investment, exports, and state and local government expenditures) will not be fully offset by even the largest government expenditure programs. 
In two years, governments, mindful of the huge increases in the debt burden resulting from the mega-bailouts and the mind-boggling deficits, will be under pressure to run primary surpluses (where government spending net of interest payments is less than revenues.) 
A few years ago, there was worry about the risk of a disorderly unwinding of “global imbalances.” 
The current crisis can be viewed as part of that, but little is being done about the underlying problems that gave rise to these imbalances. 
We need not just temporary stimuli, but longer-term solutions. 
It is not as if there was a shortage of needs; it is only that those who might meet those needs have a shortage of funds. 
First, we need to reverse the worrying trends of growing inequality. 
More progressive income taxation will also help stabilize the economy, through what economists call “automatic stabilizers.” 
It would also help if the advanced developed countries fulfilled their commitments to helping the world’s poorest by increasing their foreign-aid budgets to 0.7% of GDP. 
Second, the world needs enormous investments if it is to respond to the challenges of global warming. 
Transportation systems and living patterns must be changed dramatically. 
Third, a global reserve system is needed. 
It makes little sense for the world’s poorest countries to lend money to the richest at low interest rates. 
The system is unstable. 
The dollar reserve system is fraying, but is likely to be replaced with a dollar/euro or dollar/euro/yen system that is even more unstable. 
Annual emissions of a global reserve currency (what Keynes called Bancor, or the IMF calls SDRs) could help fuel global aggregate demand, and be used to promote development and address the problems of global warming. 
This year will be bleak. 
The question we need to be asking now is, how can we enhance the likelihood that we will eventually emerge into a robust recovery? 
Getting Prices Right 
HONG KONG – Building and maintaining the infrastructure of property rights – the rules, laws, registers, and administrative and judicial structures that define, protect, and enforce such rights and regulate economic transactions – has traditionally been the responsibility of national governments. 
But, as the world economy has become increasingly interconnected, a global property-rights infrastructure (PRI) has emerged – further raising the stakes of developing effective national PRIs and accurate price-discovery mechanisms. 
The global PRI has arisen through countries’ widespread accession to the World Trade Organization, international accounting and regulatory criteria like the Basel Accords, standards established by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, and some aspects of international law. 
As national economies and multinational companies compete for market share, global standards of market behavior become increasingly important. 
Consider the smart-phone industry, in which corporations like Apple, Samsung, Sony, Nokia, and Huawei compete fiercely to secure their global market shares. 
Given that companies cannot compete effectively in global markets without a sound domestic PRI, such firm-level competition has driven countries to improve the national PRI over the longer term. 
Furthermore, establishing accurate asset-price levels is essential to a well-functioning market. 
The state affects asset prices indirectly through its influence on inflation, interest rates, and the strength of the currency. 
Governments can directly influence the prices of key resources like energy, money, and public goods and services through taxation, customs duties, production quotas, and natural-resource ownership. 
Government intervention in benchmark prices can be justified in the name of macroeconomic management or regulatory action to improve the provision of public goods and services. 
After all, the state determines the supply of fiat money and is responsible for energy and natural-resource conservation. 
But there is a risk that the state can get important prices seriously wrong. 
This is particularly true of money, which has two prices. 
The government (the visible hand) sets the benchmark price for risk-free financial assets through monetary policy and control over fiscal deficits, while the market (the invisible hand) sets the risk premia of risky assets above the benchmark rate. 
The distinction between the two prices is the foundation of modern finance theory. 
But the system rests on the assumption that the government will set accurate benchmark interest rates for risk-free assets. 
As the recent crises in advanced countries demonstrated, this is not a safe assumption: Unsustainable public debt and fiscal deficits forced central banks to expand their balance sheets massively, causing benchmark rates to turn negative in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. 
In fact, lowering the benchmark rates for risk-free assets changes the distribution of the risk premia on risky assets, making it too low when asset bubbles are forming and too high when they burst. 
This pattern was evident in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the eurozone crisis that erupted in 2010. 
The logic and the mechanism that the government uses to set benchmark prices are very different from those that the market uses to set risk premia. 
The former implements policy decisions, based on economic, social, and political considerations, while profit-maximizing behavior – anchored by the state-determined price and requiring a robust PRI – determines the latter. 
Thus, the role of the market in price discovery is inextricable from that of the government. 
Indeed, there is a complex, non-linear feedback relationship between the two, so developing an accurate capital-pricing system depends on both actors. 
Until recently, advanced-country markets predominated in setting risk premia, owing to their mature and well-functioning PRIs, which include clear rules and a high level of transparency in price formation. 
But, even in advanced countries, the influence of vested interests can lead to collective-action failures and, in turn, to incorrect benchmark rates. 
Last year’s LIBOR scandal, in which banks were found to be reporting inaccurate interest rates in order to manipulate the prices of financial instruments, epitomized this risk. 
Meanwhile, given that many emerging economies have incomplete or immature PRIs, their influence over market-price discovery is relatively weak. 
In state-dominated systems like China’s, developing an effective PRI – delineating market participants’ rights and responsibilities, ensuring the exchange platform’s transparency, and creating a fair and equitable process of dispute resolution – is particularly challenging, because the state acts as a regulator, asset owner, enterprise operator, and competitor in the market. 
In such systems, the government directly controls the benchmark interest rates. 
But setting the correct rate for risk-free assets is difficult when capital flows easily across borders, enabling market participants to exploit discrepancies between countries’ rates. 
Herein lies the dilemma (one that China currently faces) of market-oriented reforms. 
While cross-border capital flows and interest and exchange rates must be liberalized to maintain economic development, such reforms raise the risk of asset bubbles if implemented under distorted benchmark prices. 
Emerging economies have watched the leveraged power of investors distort the price-formation process in crisis-stricken advanced economies. 
Preventing this from occurring in emerging economies requires that these countries’ leaders balance monetary, fiscal, and macro-prudential policies in a way that enables correct pricing of risk-free assets. 
Striking this balance is made even more complicated by the influence of advanced-country policies on emerging economies. 
Exceptionally low interest rates and quantitative easing may be appropriate for advanced economies experiencing slow growth, but they can be problematic for emerging economies struggling to promote market-oriented price-discovery mechanisms. 
In this environment, it may be appropriate to strengthen the global PRI further. 
The Root of All Sovereign-Debt Crises 
NEW YORK – The Greek debt crisis has prompted questions about whether the euro can survive without a nearly unimaginable centralization of fiscal policy. 
There is a simpler way. 
Irresponsible borrowing by governments in international credit markets requires irresponsible lending. 
Bank regulators should just say no to such lending by institutions that are already under their purview. 
Lending to foreign governments is in many ways inherently riskier than unsecured private debt or junk bonds. 
Private borrowers often have to offer collateral, such as their houses. 
The collateral limits the lenders’ downside risk, and the fear of losing the pledged assets encourages borrowers to act prudently. 
But governments offer no collateral, and their principal incentive to repay – the fear of being cut off by international credit markets – derives from a perverse addiction. 
Only governments that are chronically unable to finance their outlays with domestic taxes or domestic debt must keep borrowing large sums abroad. 
A deep craving for the favor of foreign lenders usually derives from some deeply engrained form of misgoverance. 
Commercial debt usually has covenants that limit the borrower’s ability to roll the dice. 
Loan or bond covenants often require borrowers to agree to maintain a minimum level of equity capital or cash on hand. 
Government bonds, on the other hand, have no covenants. 
Similarly, private borrowers can go to prison if they misrepresent their financial condition to secure bank loans. 
Securities laws require that issuers of corporate bonds spell out all possible risks. 
By contrast, governments pay no penalties for outrageous misrepresentation or fraudulent accounting, as the Greek debacle shows. 
When private borrowers default, bankruptcy courts supervise a bankruptcy or reorganization process through which even unsecured creditors can hope to recover something. 
But there is no process for winding up a state and no legal venue for renegotiating its debts. 
Worse, the debt that states raise abroad is usually denominated in a currency whose value they cannot control. 
So a gradual, invisible reduction in the debt burden by debasing the currency is rarely an option. 
The power to tax is thought to make government debt safer: private borrowers have no right to the profits or wages that they need to satisfy their obligations. 
But the power to tax has practical limits, and governments’ moral or legal right to bind future generations of citizens to repay foreign creditors is questionable. 
Lending to states thus involves unfathomable risks that ought to be borne by specialized players who are willing to live with the consequences. 
Historically, sovereign lending was a job for a few intrepid financiers, who drove shrewd bargains and were adept at statecraft. 
Lending to governments against the collateral of a port or railroad – or the use of military force to secure repayment – was not unknown. 
After the 1970’s, though, sovereign lending became institutionalized. 
Citibank – whose chief executive, Walter Wriston, famously declared that countries don’t go bust – led the charge, recycling a flood of petrodollars to dubious regimes. 
It was more lucrative business than traditional lending: a few bankers could lend enormous sums with little due diligence – except for the small detail that governments plied with easy credit do sometimes default. 
Later, the Basel accords whetted banks’ appetite for more government bonds by ruling them virtually risk-free. 
Banks loaded up on the relatively high-yield debt of countries like Greece because they had to set aside very little capital. 
But, while the debt was highly rated, how could anyone objectively assess unsecured and virtually unenforceable obligations? 
Bank lending to sovereign borrowers has been a double disaster, fostering over-indebtedness, especially in countries with irresponsible or corrupt governments. 
And, because much of the risk is borne by banks (rather than by, say, hedge funds), which play a central role in lubricating the payments system, a sovereign-debt crisis can cause widespread harm. 
The Greek debacle jeopardized the well-being of all of Europe, not only Greeks. 
The solution to breaking the nexus between sovereign-debt crises and banking crises is straightforward: limit banks to lending where evaluation of borrowers’ willingness and ability to repay isn’t a great leap in the dark. 
This means no cross-border sovereign debt (or esoteric instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations). 
This simple rule would require no complex reordering of European fiscal arrangements, nor would it require the creation of new supra-national entities. 
It would certainly make it difficult for governments to borrow abroad, but that would be a good outcome for their citizens, not an imposition. 
Moreover, curtailing governments’ access to international credit (and, by extension, inducing more fiscal responsibility) could actually help more enterprising and productive borrowers. 
Such constraints wouldn’t solve the current crisis in Portugal, Ireland, Greece, or Spain. 
But it is high time that Europe, and the world, stopped lurching from one short-term fix to the next and addressed the real structural issues. 
The Roots of America’s Financial Crisis 
CAMBRIDGE – The US Federal Reserve’s desperate attempts to keep America’s economy from sinking are remarkable for at least two reasons. 
First, until just a few months ago, the conventional wisdom was that the US would avoid recession. 
Now recession looks certain. 
Second, the Fed’s actions do not seem to be effective. 
Although interest rates have been slashed and the Fed has lavished liquidity on cash-strapped banks, the crisis is deepening. 
To a large extent, the US crisis was actually made by the Fed, helped by the wishful thinking of the Bush administration. 
One main culprit was none other than Alan Greenspan, who left the current Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, with a terrible situation. 
But Bernanke was a Fed governor in the Greenspan years, and he, too, failed to diagnose correctly the growing problems with its policies. 
Today’s financial crisis has its immediate roots in 2001, amid the end of the Internet boom and the shock of the September 11 terrorist attacks. 
It was at that point that the Fed turned on the monetary spigots to try to combat an economic slowdown. 
The Fed pumped money into the US economy and slashed its main interest rate – the Federal Funds rate – from 3.5% in August 2001 to a mere 1% by mid-2003. 
The Fed held this rate too low for too long. 
Monetary expansion generally makes it easier to borrow, and lowers the costs of doing so, throughout the economy. 
It also tends to weaken the currency and increase inflation. 
All of this began to happen in the US. 
What was distinctive this time was that the new borrowing was concentrated in housing. 
It is generally true that lower interest rates spur home buying, but this time, as is now well known, commercial and investment banks created new financial mechanisms to expand housing credit to borrowers with little creditworthiness. 
The Fed declined to regulate these dubious practices. 
Virtually anyone could borrow to buy a house, with little or even no down payment, and with interest charges pushed years into the future. 
As the home-lending boom took hold, it became self-reinforcing. 
Greater home buying pushed up housing prices, which made banks feel that it was safe to lend money to non-creditworthy borrowers. 
After all, if they defaulted on their loans, the banks would repossess the house at a higher value. 
Or so the theory went. 
Of course, it works only as long as housing prices rise. 
Once they peak and begin to decline, lending conditions tighten, and banks find themselves repossessing houses whose value does not cover the value of the debt. 
What was stunning was how the Fed, under Greenspan’s leadership, stood by as the credit boom gathered steam, barreling toward a subsequent crash. 
There were a few naysayers, but not many in the financial sector itself. 
Banks were too busy collecting fees on new loans, and paying their managers outlandish bonuses. 
At a crucial moment in 2005, while he was a governor but not yet Fed Chairman, Bernanke described the housing boom as reflecting a prudent and well-regulated financial system, not a dangerous bubble. 
He argued that vast amounts of foreign capital flowed through US banks to the housing sector because international investors appreciated “the depth and sophistication of the country’s financial markets (which among other things have allowed households easy access to housing wealth).” 
In the course of 2006 and 2007, the financial bubble that is now bringing down once-mighty financial institutions peaked. 
Banks’ balance sheets were by then filled with vast amounts of risky mortgages, packaged in complicated forms that made the risks hard to evaluate. 
Banks began to slow their new lending, and defaults on mortgages began to rise. 
Housing prices peaked as lending slowed, and prices then started to decline. 
The housing bubble was bursting by last fall, and banks with large mortgage holdings started reporting huge losses, sometimes big enough to destroy the bank itself, as in the case of Bear Stearns. 
With the housing collapse lowering spending, the Fed, in an effort to ward off recession and help banks with fragile balance sheets, has been cutting interest rates since the fall of 2007. 
But this time, credit expansion is not flowing into housing construction, but rather into commodity speculation and foreign currency. 
The Fed’s easy money policy is now stoking US inflation rather than a recovery. 
Oil, food, and gold prices have jumped to historic highs, and the dollar has depreciated to historic lows. 
A Euro now costs around $1.60, up from $0.90 in January 2002. 
Yet the Fed, in its desperation to avoid a US recession, keeps pouring more money into the system, intensifying the inflationary pressures. 
Having stoked a boom, now the Fed can’t prevent at least a short-term decline in the US economy, and maybe worse. 
If it pushes too hard on continued monetary expansion, it won’t prevent a bust but instead could create stagflation – inflation and economic contraction. 
The Fed should take care to prevent any breakdown of liquidity while keeping inflation under control and avoiding an unjustified taxpayer-financed bailout of risky bank loans. 
Throughout the world, there may be some similar effects, to the extent that foreign banks also hold bad US mortgages on their balance sheets, or in the worst case, if a general financial crisis takes hold. 
There is still a good chance, however, that the US downturn will be limited mainly to America, where the housing boom and bust is concentrated. 
The damage to the rest of the world economy, I believe, can remain limited. 
The Roots of China’s Rapid Recovery 
BEIJING – China’s GDP is estimated to have grown 8.7% year on year in 2009 – once again the highest rate in the world – with the fourth-quarter increase reaching 10.7%, compared to 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
For much of the world, China’s ability to shrug off the global financial crisis and maintain a strong growth trajectory in 2010 and 2011 seems too easy. 
But securing China’s growth has been anything but easy. 
The strong, decisive, and deftly timed stimulus policies at the start of the financial crisis did, of course, play a major role in China’s quick rebound. 
As early as October 2008, when the crisis first hit, China’s government adopted a comprehensive policy package designed to prevent the economy from sliding further. 
The fiscal deficit was equivalent to 3% of GDP in 2009, which generated 3% GDP growth, while the deficit in 2008 was literally zero. 
The country’s so-called “moderate relax” monetary policy also played its part by allowing bank lending to expand by almost 34% in 2009, with M2 money supply growing by 27%. 
Monetary growth may increase inflationary pressures and the risk of an asset bubble down the road, but it helped ensure that China’s economy did not fall into a vicious downturn when the financial crisis hit. 
Other policy moves aimed at boosting demand in the housing and auto market also proved effective. 
But China’s crisis management is only part of the story. 
It does not explain why other countries that took even stronger measures failed to generate a similarly rapid recovery, or why China’s government seems to have more room than others for policy maneuver. 
China ’s budget was actually in surplus and its government debt-to-GDP ratio was only 21% before the crisis (now it is about 24%), much lower than any other major economy. 
That gave Chinese policymakers freedom to spend money to confront the crisis. 
Moreover, the level of non-performing loans in Chinese banks was quite low when Lehman Brothers collapsed, which allowed Chinese policymakers to let it increase in order to battle the crisis. 
Moreover, the Chinese economy was in good shape when the global crisis hit. 
Cautious macroeconomic management during China’s boom, including early self-adjustment, put China in a favorable position. 
China’s economy had been booming since 2004, but officials did not step aside and “let the market decide.” 
Instead, they adopted counter-cyclical measures aimed at preventing the economy from overheating. 
The government increasingly tightened its policies as the economy continued to surge ahead due to asset bubbles, high local-government investment spending, and buoyant demand in global markets for Chinese goods. 
Overheating in the housing market was brought to an end in late September 2007, nipping a nascent nationwide bubble, and a stock-market bubble was punctured the following month. 
Moreover, numerous local investment projects were stopped, while measures to slow the growth of net exports – including a 20% revaluation of the renminbi and a significant cut in tariff rebates for exports – brought down annual export growth from around 30% to a more reasonable 17% in late 2007. 
As a result, by the fourth quarter of 2007 – one year before the global financial crisis hit – China’s economy started to cool. 
The quarterly growth rate decelerated from 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 9% in the third quarter of 2009. 
In short, it is because China began its adjustment one year before the global crisis that its economy emerged earlier than other countries. 
The lesson is that booms have to be managed adeptly, and that financiers have to be supervised in their pursuit of ever-higher returns. 
That is true for developed economies no less than for a developing economy like China. 
Of course, China’s economy has structural and institutional problems – what developing country does not? 
China’s macroeconomic policies are probably still too “administrative.” 
When many of the most important actors in an economy are insensitive to market price signals, as they are in China, economic policy will need to be administrative in order to deal effectively with those players. 
But one benefit of this administrative bias over the past 30 years is that, at least most of the time, China has been cautious about overheating – and determined to step in whenever necessary to cool the economy, despite the protests of “smart” market participants. 
To be sure, the authorities have sometimes been overly cautious. 
But for an economy in its early stage of development, and for the first generation of companies with young “animal spirits,” excessive caution seems better than the alternative. 
In fact, when a country’s economic growth is continuously above 9%, policymakers probably cannot be too cautious. 
No doubt, government macroeconomic management that is too strong may delay necessary market-oriented reforms. 
But the financial crisis has shown that a twenty-first-century market economy requires government participation to function. 
For a developing economy like China, it is better to have a government that plays an active role in avoiding the ups and downs that the Western economies experienced in their early days – and are still experiencing today. 
The Roots of Islamic Backwardness 
The war in Iraq is over. 
But the battle to transform the economies of the Middle East--the only hope of preventing fanaticism from claiming a generation of young unemployed Arabs and Iranians--is only beginning. 
That struggle goes beyond development strategies and touches the roots of Islam. "The people of Iran," the late Ayatollah Khomeini is reported to have liked to say, "did not make the Islamic Revolution to lower the price of watermelons." 
By that logic, capitalism and Islam are incompatible. 
Are they? 
History may provide some guidance here. 
The Industrial Revolution started in the English midlands and Belgian forests--regions endowed with coal, canals (along which barges could carry the coal), and skilled metalworkers (who could build coal-burning steam engines). 
Coal, canals, and metalworkers were the foundation for building, installing, and using the automatic spinning machines, power looms, and railway locomotives that were the first modern machine industries. 
Steam power, factories, markets, and industry quickly spread throughout northwest Europe and its settler colonies. 
By the end of the 19th century, Turin, Vienna, Prague, Wroclaw, Essen, Paris, Lille, Liege, Lyons, and Barcelona in continental Europe, much of Britain and the United States, parts of Canada and Ireland, and Melbourne, Buenos Aires, and Johannesburg (plus, of course, Tokyo) were centers of modern industry. 
Beyond these limits, however, the fires of the Industrial Revolution barely smoldered, if they burned at all. 
For two centuries, far-sighted Ottoman viziers had argued for the need to spur Turkey's economic and technological development: back in 1453, Sultan Mehmet II's armies had conquered Constantinople, because Mehmet had built the most technologically advanced and powerful artillery in the world. 
In the early 19th century, Egypt's Mehemet Ali looked at the global balance of economic and military power, and decreed that Egypt must industrialize, fast. 
He feared that unless Egyptians could learn modern industrial technologies and develop an economy prosperous enough to support modern industrial armies, his descendants would be mere puppets of British and French viceroys. 
His decree went nowhere: Egypt did not industrialize, and Mehemet Ali's great grandchildren did indeed become puppets of the British and French. 
Today's 70 million Egyptians live much better than their heavily taxed cotton- and grain-growing predecessors of Mehemet Ali's time. 
But the gap between the economies of the Arab Middle East and Western Europe--in (non-oil sector) productivity, technological capability, and standards of living--is wider than it was a century ago, and vastly greater than at the start of the Industrial Age. 
In many respects, the slow pace of the Islamic world's economic development has been a matter of choice. 
The Prophet Muhammad was a merchant, and the Quraysh (Mecca's ruling tribe at the time of the Prophet) lived by guiding caravans from Arabia to the Fertile Crescent. 
But the affinity between Islamic attitudes, rulers, merchants, and craftsmen that made Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, and Samarkand jewels of High Medieval urban civilization vanished long ago. 
Industrialization means novelty and change. 
If those who hold power fear that change may bring unpleasant consequences, they will systematically obstruct it, which rulers in the Middle East proceeded to do for centuries. 
But slow and distorted development in the Islamic world is the result of blocked opportunities as well. 
Wouldn't Pakistan be much better off if it exported more of its textiles to the rich industrial world? 
Wouldn't waiving Pakistan's quota under the Multi-Fiber Agreement have been a very good and important step for the US government to take in reciprocation of the Pakistani government's help as US-led forces attacked Al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan? 
No doubt it would have been. 
Wouldn't prospects for economic development in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia be much more promising if European governments would let EU citizens buy more North African oranges? 
Of course. 
But other key reasons for the slow pace of economic development in the Islamic world reflect the standard dilemmas of poor governance. "Protect property rights and enforce contracts," say Western economists. 
But property rights and contracts are threatened at many levels. 
They are threatened by roving bandits, by local notables, and, most of all, by government functionaries who use their offices to extort extra income. 
Simply put, a weak state cannot enforce contracts and property rights, while a state that is strong enough to enforce them must control its own bureaucrats. 
However, the most important reasons that the Islamic world has done worse than Latin America or Southeast Asia seem to be focused around education. 
There can be little hope for sustained economic development where the educational system is at least one generation--and possibly three generations--behind other regions in terms of its commitment to universal literacy, and where higher education largely ignores the skills and subjects needed to enable people to master technology. 
After all, blocked export opportunities, weak government institutions, and high levels of corruption are worldwide problems. 
Even political and religious leaders hostile to change and industrialization are not uncommon. 
But as we compare patterns of development throughout the world, more and more evidence is piling up that universal literacy and a large class of people with industrial-technical skills are key resources that determine whether countries are able to break free from the grip of backwardness and poverty. 
The Roots of Sino-American Antagonism 
Although we still do not know what sent jousting Chinese and American planes as well as Sino�US relations into a nose dive, this has not hindered people on both sides from unleashing an avalanche of accusations and uncompromising demands for apologies. 
While an answer to the question as to what actually happened remains elusive, a more important question begs our attention: why do such incidents balloon into crises that keep US�China ties almost permanently out of kilter? 
Both nations have a long and complicated history with each other. 
The United States arrived on the Chinese scene during the 19th century flushed with its “manifest destiny” to trade and save China's soul, following this in the 20th century with a messianic effort to save China from Godless Communism. 
But mixed with America’s moral and economic concerns were large measures of condescension and arrogance, which arose from seeing China as a poor, benighted land in need of rescue. 
For a proud and once powerful land such as China, such noblesse oblige was painful to accept and created lasting reservoirs of resentment. 
To travel through urban China today is in many ways a deceptive experience. 
Yes, China has emerged into the global market and boasts many of the hallmarks of a modernizing society. 
Many of these emblems of modernity and cosmopolitanism, however, mask the provenance of China's “socialist revolution.” 
We forget, indeed, that China had such a revolution, and that there were both reasons and consequences to that convulsive experience. 
China's current government arrived through a tectonic revolution animated by anti�imperialism, anti�colonialism, and anti�capitalism codified as orthodox Marxist�Leninist doctrine. 
These sentiments resulted from a century of being preyed upon by the West beginning with the first Opium War (1839�42), when Britain seized Hong Kong as a colony and then sailed up China’s coast with warships to force open one coastal “treaty port” after an other. 
Over the next century, China became a patchwork of special foreign concessions, spheres of economic influence and missionary enclaves which left it, fen'gua, or “carved up like a melon,” in the parlance of the time. 
This bitter experience reached an apogee in the 1930s and '40s with Japan's brutal occupation. 
It was not until US involvement in the Chinese civil war on the side of Chiang Kai�shek’s Nationalists in the late 1940s and in the Korean War in the early 1950s that America became fully identified as a major “hostile foreign force” by the Chinese Communists. 
Yet, by the mid� '70s, when I first went to China during the Cultural Revolution, hardly a public surface was not emblazoned with the slogan: “Down With American Imperialism And Its Running Dogs.” 
Even though the Chinese felt incensed by foreign interference and domination, many also came to admire America for its democracy, openness, energy and willingness to help. 
This divided attitude meant that China tended to react in ways as contradictory as they were impassioned and unpredictable, especially when its pride was piqued. 
Nothing was more repugnant to China's new nationalists than the idea of a weak and aggrieved China victimized by foreign exploitation. 
Nothing provoked a more muscular reaction after Mao came to power than the humiliating prospect of feeling unable to resist foreign predation. 
It is from this side of China's bipolar attitude toward America that its emotional response to the aerial collision near Hainan Island arises. 
Indeed, like a character trait encoded on a recessive gene which reexpresses itself even after it has lost its functionality, China continues to react to the world around it as if it were still fighting against implacable imperialist foes. 
What makes the Hainan spy plane incident so provocative is the idea that US planes cruise the China coast like so many 19th century British men�of�war, now stealing China's military secrets by triggering radar systems and eavesdropping rather than firing cannons at Chinese junks and selling opium. 
It is not extreme to describe China's reaction to such incidents as almost robotic. 
For, if there was one thing to which Mao's revolution was committed which still endures, it is a commitment to the idea that China will never again allow itself to appear weak and defenseless against foreign incursion. 
What the incident over Hainan reveals is how deeply rooted ways of reacting to the world can become in a national psyche. 
Chinese leaders imagine that they are demonstrating strength when they bluster and detain the American EP�3E crew, but they are actually revealing a self�defeating backwardness because they have mis�identified their real enemy, which is not America, even when it acts in a retrograde fashion. 
Their enemy is their own suspiciousness and paranoia which deludes them into believing that the world is still against them when it is not. 
Whatever the result of the Hainan incident, China and the US will continue to have disputes. 
America’s challenge is to escape the Cold War mind�set, China's challenge is to transcend its past in the name of its present national interest. 
To achieve this, it will probably have to transcend its Marxists�Leninist heritage – something it has begun to do in important ways. 
As a new form of “self strengthening,” a cause that Chinese reformers embraced at the end of the 19th century, China needs to stop brandishing old wounds and instead of demanding apologies as an aggrieved party, seek a new, equal status that the rest of the world, including America, is ready to confer. 
The Rules of Reconstruction 
Lebanon’s reconstruction, so painstakingly carried out in the 1990’s, is now at risk of being undone. 
But Lebanon is not alone in that respect: according to the UN and several independent studies, countries in transition from war to peace face roughly a 50% chance of sliding back into warfare. 
Indeed, in East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and many other countries, the transition to peace seems to be failing. 
Likewise, there is unfinished business in many other countries undergoing reconstruction. 
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), for example, just held its first elections in 40 years. 
The stability of the Great Lakes region of Africa, perhaps that continent’s most violent area, will depend on the success of its transition and reconstruction. 
When wars end, countries confront a multi-pronged transition. 
Violence must give way to security for inhabitants; lawlessness and political exclusion must give way to the rule of law and participatory government; ethnic, religious, or class/caste polarization must give way to national reconciliation; and ruined war economies must be transformed into functioning market economies that enable ordinary people to support themselves. 
These multiple tasks make economic reconstruction fundamentally different from “development as usual.” 
To succeed, the transition to peace requires demobilization, disarmament and reintegration of former combatants, as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation of services and infrastructure. 
To meet these goals, the objective of peace should prevail over that of development if the two come into conflict. 
Often, optimal economic policies and best practices are not attainable – or even desirable. 
This also means that peace-related programs should get priority in budget allocations. 
Of course, the legitimacy of the government or other policymaking body will determine what is possible in economic policymaking. 
A weak interim national government – or a United Nations or foreign occupying administration – should not attempt to implement policies such as privatizing national resources when doing so might incite political resistance. 
Indeed, early privatization is likely to be destructive in its own terms, because property rights will remain in question for some time. 
Thus, a new yardstick is needed to measure success. 
Projects must be judged by whether they contribute to peace and reconciliation, rather than on purely economic grounds. 
Effective demobilization and reconciliation in El Salvador, for example, ensured the consolidation of peace after that country’s brutal civil war of the 1980’s. 
Elsewhere, however, disregarding the primacy of politics in a transition to peace has had tragic consequences. 
The failure to demobilize and reconcile factions in Lebanon, where Hezbollah remained armed despite its transformation into a political party, meant that belligerency was always bubbling below the surface. 
Likewise, the collapse of peace processes in Angola and Haiti and the various setbacks in Cambodia and Nicaragua during the 1990’s reflect a failure to demobilize and integrate. 
On the surface, the UN seems ideally placed to lead reconstruction efforts because, unlike development institutions like the World Bank, it can integrate the political and economic objectives that are equal parts of a transition to peace. 
Yet, time and again, the UN has shown itself to be incompetent in this role. 
In Kosovo, for example, the transformation of the Kosovo Liberation Army into a civilian peace force has caused great insecurity over the years, which the UN administration might ultimately regret if the resolution of the province’s final status does not lead to independence. 
Treating the transition to peace as “development as usual” has, moreover, led to new violence in East Timor, a country that the UN once trumpeted as a success story. 
The commercial exploitation of rich oil and gas reserves in the Timor Gap could have facilitated reconstruction and created jobs for the 30% of the labor force that is unemployed. 
Instead, with the strong approval of the IMF, East Timor created a Norwegian-style “petroleum fund” to save the money for a rainy day. 
But in East Timor, that rainy day is now. 
Iraq provides numerous examples of the dangers created by misplaced priorities. 
Early efforts to privatize Iraq’s oil industry proved disastrous, confirming for many Iraqis that the occupying Americans were determined to “steal” the country’s wealth and thus fanning the flames of violent resistance. 
Indeed, privatization was all the more bizarre as a policy choice because it was doomed in advance: investors clearly would not be attracted to buy assets where property rights might change once a legitimate Iraqi government took over – a huge impediment to investment in Kosovo as well. 
But the United States has not learned its lesson. 
On the verge of civil war, Iraq just announced a restructuring of its foreign debt. 
Rather than improving services and living conditions in areas where it could have helped consolidate peace, the government, at America’s behest, will allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to pay investment banks, accounting firms, and legal advisors who assist with that refinancing. 
Any transition to peace may well prove ephemeral unless policymakers make political reconciliation and integration – not optimal economic policies – the bedrock priority. 
Despite its failures, the UN is probably still the best-placed organization to oversee such efforts. 
But the complexity of the tasks that post-conflict countries face underscores the urgent challenge of providing the UN with the capacity to meet them. 
The Russian Revival 
Russia’s national revival and new assertiveness under President Vladimir Putin is not really home made but reflects highly auspicious international conditions. 
Oil and gas prices are sky high, the United States is overwhelmed by serious problems in Iraq and the Middle East, and the West is divided about how it should deal with Russia. 
Putin’s administration has been keen to take advantage of this favorable environment. 
Yet, although some of the Kremlin’s moves seem clear and reasonable, others can scarcely be described as rational or forward-looking. 
For example, Russia’s desire to take ownership stakes in Europe’s gas distribution markets makes perfect sense and is fully legitimate given Russia’s energy assets and pipeline capacity. 
Likewise, Russia’s effort to expand its influence in the energy-rich countries of Central Asia is aimed at consolidating Russia’s stature as a major energy supplier. 
Asserting itself as a major power outside the Western realm, Russia has boosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which includes China and most Central Asian countries. 
Indeed, Russia is increasingly attaching ever greater significance to its relations with China, something of a strategic shift in foreign policy, even if it is not yet clear how close Russia wants to be get to China. 
But bullying Georgia and Moldova, demonstrating support for Hamas, or indulging North Korea do not seem to be guided by any strategic sense of Russia’s far-reaching interests. They seem guided by pure and simple spite. 
Russia’s heavy-handed pressure on Georgia and its support of secessionist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two unrecognized republics within Georgia, inflames passions and risks destabilizing the already tense Northern Caucasus. 
Should instability ignite into open warfare, Russia will find it impossible to avoid the consequences. 
Of course, Georgia’s President Mikhail Saakashvili may at times be thoughtless and arrogant. 
But if Russia’s policy toward him lets events in Georgia get out of control, Russia will be held accountable. 
Because Russia claims the status of a world power, it is expected to show restraint and responsibility. 
But the urge to project strength for the mere sake of doing so now seems overwhelming for the Kremlin. 
This urge stems from a desire to make up for the years of Russia’s humiliation after the USSR collapsed, years when the West contemptuously disregarded Russia’s views and interests. 
This lingering resentment may explain Putin’s somewhat uncivil behavior and dubious jokes when dealing with his Western counterparts. 
It may also have been behind Russia’s irrational decision to renege on its promise to give Poland the files that document the massacre of thousands of Polish officers on Stalin’s orders in the forest at Katyn at the outbreak of WWII. 
What possible benefits can Russia gain by breaking this pledge? 
The motive seems to be brutally simple: “Precisely because you want it, we won’t deliver. 
We can do what we like because we’re strong again.” 
But this renewed vigor is too fresh for Russia to feel truly confident. 
Putin’s irresistible urge to remind everyone that Russia has recovered its strength suggests underlying insecurity. 
In an episode recently reported by The New York Times , at one of Putin’s informal meetings with Bush, Putin showed the US president his Labrador and said, “Bigger, tougher, stronger, faster, meaner than Barney” (Bush’s dog). 
Though Putin barely implied that the dog’s superiority indicates Russia’s domination over the US, his remark appears to be in line with his general message: don’t you ever dare to doubt our high status. 
Russia is by no means seeking to isolate itself. 
Russia needs America and the West in order to realize its ambitious initiative to establish international centers of uranium enrichment, and it needs Western markets, which are the largest consumers of Russia’s gas and oil. 
Moreover, it is in the West where the rich and powerful Russian elite likes to travel, go shopping, and send their kids to school. 
But Russia’s muscle-flexing behavior leaves Western leaders perplexed and wary, which seems a dubious way for the Kremlin to secure Russia’s new stature. 
Contentious foreign policy makes contacts uneasy and agreements difficult to reach. 
It damages the trust needed for stronger trade relations. 
As Russia’s conflict with Ukraine in early January over gas prices demonstrated, when Russia plays rough, the West grows apprehensive and suspicious rather than more amenable. 
What will happen should crude strength and hard language prove inadequate to the task of insuring Russian national interests? 
No one can say, but Russia’s history in this regard is not a source of hope. 
The Russians are Coming – With Cash 
MOSCOW – Russia’s government is sitting on a giant pile of cash that it plans to invest in foreign assets. 
The glimpse of its economic muscle was revealed this week when the Prime Minister of Iceland announced that Russia may come with about $5 billion to save its troubled economy. 
Who could have thought that, given the chaotic Russia of the 1990’s, only ten years later it would be in the position to bail out a developed country? 
Even more surprising is the fact that the helping hand for Iceland comes at a time when the domestic stock market is in a free fall and trading on the Moscow stock exchange is routinely halted. 
The Kremlin thinks that now is the time to buy assets cheaply, using the current financial crisis to emerge as a powerful global economic player. 
As Prime Minister Vladimir Putin remarked at a recent meeting with the CEO of state-owned bank VTB, “Perhaps we should buy something [abroad]? 
Something that is up for grabs?” According to Arkady Dvorkovich, an economic aide to President Dmitry Medvedev, the government will support – both diplomatically and financially – the expansion of Russian companies abroad. 
Following the Russian-Georgian war, the West is scared that Russia’s government will use its cash not just for economic purposes, but as an aggressive foreign policy tool. 
Should the West really consider blocking Russian investments abroad as a way to influence Russia? 
Trying to erect an Iron Curtain around Russian funds and businesses will prove counterproductive. 
Indeed, a large-scale “invasion” of Russian business would be a positive development, because it would foster economic interdependence. 
This is true even if the economic expansion is led by state-owned companies and by Russian sovereign wealth funds. 
By investing in American and European assets, Russia’s government and business elites are buying a stake in the global economy. 
This should bring better mutual understanding and a more rational and accountable foreign policy. 
Paradoxically, despite recent hits to the Russian stock market, Russia remains awash with cash. 
Russia’s government just rolled out a $130 billion bailout plan for the country’s banking system; as a percentage of GDP this would be equivalent to about $1.3 trillion in the US – almost double the Paulson plan. 
Yet, even this package has not significantly eaten into Russia’s sovereign wealth funds and its world’s third largest currency reserves. 
The government’s Reserve Fund, created to cushion the economy from a fall in oil prices, stands at $140 billion, and the National Welfare Fund, intended mainly to solve the coming pension crisis, holds another $30 billion. 
The NWF, though not yet officially a “sovereign wealth fund,” is already among the 10 largest such funds, rivaling the Brunei Investment Agency. 
A combined Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund (excluding the half-trillion dollars in foreign-exchange reserves) would rival Singapore’s Temasek Holdings (currently sixth in the world) and lag just behind the China Investment Corporation. 
By design, these funds are intended to be invested outside Russia. 
As today’s financial crisis has made many Western assets cheap, they are now within reach of Russia’s government and leading Russian companies. 
Russian private and state-owned companies have already invested abroad extensively, often buying stakes in large foreign companies. 
Overall, the top 25 Russian companies hold $59 billion in foreign assets and are the third largest investors in emerging economies, following Hong Kong and Brazil. 
Even though the financial crisis has wiped out Russian stock market, some of the best-run companies are hit less badly than their Western counterparts and will therefore be shopping in the global market next year. 
Russian corporations’ foreign investments have already generated a heated debate in both the United States and Europe – even when investment was done by a private company. 
The largest controversy surrounded a merger that Russian steel giant SeverStal sought with Luxemburg-based Arcelor. 
SeverStal was rejected in favor of Mittal Steel, with some commentators claiming that the decision was taken on political grounds. 
But no investment by a private Russian company has, so far, been vetoed by Western governments. 
Yet hostility towards investment by Russia’s government (and government companies) has been almost universal until recently. 
US and European policymakers do not trust that foreign governments (and their sovereign wealth funds) invest solely on business grounds. 
But the financial crisis is making the West happy to find “friends with cash.” 
During his visit to Russia in June, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson emphasized that the US is interested in welcoming Russian investment, including investment by Russia’s sovereign wealth funds. 
But Russia’s government still needs to set up a transparent and accountable structure to manage its sovereign wealth. 
Doing so will also help to convince other countries that the government’s agenda is economic, not political. 
Russian authorities may be advancing that goal by taking initial steps toward improving corporate governance in state-owned companies. 
In an unprecedented move, the government replaced a large number of bureaucrats on the boards of these companies with independent directors (including a couple of foreigners). 
While it is unlikely that Russian sovereign wealth funds and state-owned companies will change overnight, they will certainly become more transparent and efficient in the near future. 
The key benefit of Russian foreign investment is not economic, but that it helps Russia become a global citizen. 
Consider Russia’s elites, who buy houses in London, ski in the Alps, and educate their children in Switzerland. 
They have too much to lose from a worsening political climate between Russia and the West. 
The Sarkozy Option 
PARIS – From the Caucasus in August 2008 to the Middle East in January 2009, is France under President Nicolas Sarkozy attempting to incarnate what might be called “the West by default,” making maximum use of the window of opportunity opened by America’s presidential transition? 
Or is Sarkozy simply trying to capitalize on his global visibility to reinforce his popularity at home, where a majority of French citizens continue to support their hyperactive president’s diplomatic leadership? 
Despite his failed bid to orchestrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, was he not right to try? 
For the French, Sarkozy’s determination to act, despite the odds, seems far superior to the passive cynicism of those who preach abstention or satisfy themselves with empty words. 
Beyond its impact on the Middle East, Sarkozy’s failed but brave attempt to act as a go-between constitutes an interesting window into the foreign-policy methods and ambitions of today’s France. 
For the essential question about Sarko-diplomacy is whether it reflects a well-defined strategy, based on a clear vision of the world, or merely expresses a shrewd and pragmatic activism that applies a keen domestic political instinct to the field of foreign affairs? 
The answer is far from clear, and is probably a combination of both. 
Sarkozy is a man prone to following his instincts. 
He does not theorize about what should be done; he simply does it, without any ideological bias or constraint. 
Yet, as time passes, one senses the emergence of something like a new French self-definition, which is probably the most clearly “Western” in the history of the Fifth Republic. 
As a presidential candidate, Sarkozy was often described as “Sarkozy the American,” an expression that alluded to his can-do style, his taste for “bling,” and the very American way in which he used his personal history to gain the support of would-be voters. 
But now one could describe him as “Sarkozy the Westerner.” 
This is not only because he has been willing to have France act, from the Caucasus to the Middle East, in the name of Europe and itself at a time America was defaulting on its role. 
Nor is it simply the result of Sarkozy’s decision to bring France closer to the United States, a move that will culminate symbolically with France’s likely return to the integrated military body of NATO in April 2009. 
In a deeper way, Sarkozy’s diplomacy reflects changes in how the French President thinks about the idea of “the West” in today’s globalized world. 
Under Charles de Gaulle, France combined faithfulness to the Western cause in time of crisis with a strong willingness to promote its diplomatic independence and freedom of maneuver. And, despite their very different styles, both Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and François Mitterrand were more “European” than “Western.” 
The same cannot be said of Sarkozy, despite his claims to the contrary. 
His rapprochement with Great Britain and his noticeable distancing of France from Germany are, from this perspective, no accident. 
In a world where, in comparative terms, there is less America because of the rise of China and India and the resurgence of Russia, and less Europe in diplomatic and strategic terms (due to institutional paralysis), if not economic and cultural terms, France, according to Sarkozy, must clearly define itself as part of the West. 
And, just as the very notion of the West must now be analyzed and probably redefined for the twenty-first century, so France must play a central part in this act of reassessment. 
Is the West a concept defined above all by its political culture, i.e., democracy and human rights, by its cultural dimension, including religion, or merely by its diplomatic and strategic implications, i.e., facing the rise of new powers? 
If the concept of the West is to become the new cornerstone of France’s diplomatic identity, it must be applied with prudence and moderation, even as Barack Obama’s arrival in the White House is likely to improve its image of the premiere Western power. 
France is not in the same league in terms of power and influence as the US. 
Moreover, it would be paradoxical if, just when America declares its willingness to call more upon its allies, particularly its European allies, the concept of the West actually leads to the diminution, if not the burial, of the European ideal. 
The Scaremongers of the Roundtable 
CHICAGO – How often do you see capitalists screaming and even going to court to defend the principle that legitimate owners cannot exercise any control over their property? 
It is not happening in Latin America or in socialist Sweden, but in the United States of America. 
The capitalists in question are nothing short of the upper echelon of corporate America: the Business Roundtable, a powerful group composed of the CEOs of major US corporations, which promotes pro-business public policies. 
The object of their contention is the much-debated “shareholders’ access to proxy” rule, adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August to address the fundamental lack of accountability of corporate boards. 
In the current system, corporate boards are self-perpetuating entities. 
To be elected, a board member needs to be nominated by the current board, where executives have considerable influence. 
As a result, board members owe their loyalty to the managers who directly or indirectly appoint them – and thus have little incentive to dissent, lest they be punished with exclusion. 
Even independent directors, often acclaimed as the solution to all problems, are subject to the same pressure. 
To change this state of affairs, institutional investors must be allowed to propose their own slate of directors. 
The possibility of being rejected in a real election would naturally make board members accountable to shareholders, indirectly making the executives accountable as well. 
The SEC rule was an attempt to grant institutional investors this right. 
It did it in a very mild format. 
Companies with a public share worth less than $75 million were exempted, and shareholders who want to propose a slate must hold at least 3% of voting power of the company’s securities and have held it continuously for at least three years. 
This is a very high hurdle. 
In June 2009, the largest US pension fund (Calpers) owned less than 0.3% of large companies such as Coca Cola and Microsoft. 
Thus, one had to coordinate ten such funds to reach the quorum. 
And even that would not suffice. 
The average pension fund has an annual turnover of 70%, which means that the probability that a stake is retained continuously for three years is less than 3%. 
Thus, to achieve that 3% of voting power and maintain it for three years continuously, one would have to assemble hundreds of institutions. 
But even this cautious attempt to strengthen accountability generated an irate reaction from the Business Roundtable. “As our country works to emerge from this recession,” its executive director wrote, “American companies need to be focused on creating jobs and encouraging innovation to put us back on a path to sustained economic growth. 
This unprecedented intrusion into areas historically reserved for the states would handcuff directors and boards, shut out the vast majority of retail shareholders, and exacerbate the short-term focus that is now seen as one of the root causes of the financial crisis.” 
Ironically, in 2007, in response to an earlier SEC proposal to grant shareholders’ access to proxy, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen ampamp; 
Katz, a law firm famous for its anti-shareholders’-rights positions, used the opposite argument: “No real-world crisis has shown that the current system needs radical revision. 
Five years after Enron and WorldCom, the capital markets are well into a cycle of unprecedented vigor.” 
In other words, if the stock market is doing well, we should not change the rules of the game that are credited for this success. 
But if the stock market is doing poorly, the rules of the games are not responsible and we cannot afford to change them. 
That is a peculiar notion of accountability. 
To block the rule, the Business Roundtable filed a petition with the US Court of Appeals to invalidate it. 
The rule had been out for review for years, but the Business Roundtable accused the SEC of having “failed to engage in evidence-based rulemaking,” because it did not assess the rule’s effects on “efficiency, competition, and capital formation,” as required by law. 
This is just a pretense. 
A similar rule has been in place in Italy since 2005, and there is no sign that efficiency, competition, or capital formation has been affected. 
There is some early sign, though, that board members nominated by institutional investors have the courage to stand up to management when it comes to excessive executive compensation. 
Is this the revolution that the Business Roundtable is afraid of? 
Unfortunately, the scare tactics employed by the Business Roundtable worked. 
Following the suit, the SEC suspended not only the application of its rule mandating companies to grant access to qualified shareholders, but also a rule that was making it easier for shareholders to introduce a bylaw granting them access, even though the Business Roundtable had not challenged that rule. 
It is a great victory for business executives, but a huge defeat for the principles that should guide capitalism. 
The Science of Acupuncture 
Like many other traditional Chinese medicines, acupuncture has for many centuries been viewed suspiciously in the West. 
It seems to work, but how? 
Is a scientific answer possible? 
Most Chinese doctors and patients have, for example, long regarded acupuncture as an effective treatment for stroke, using it to improve motor, speech, and other functions that have been destroyed. 
One survey showed that 66% of Chinese doctors use acupuncture routinely to treat the effects of stroke, with 63% of the doctors surveyed believing it to be effective. 
Some 36% of Chinese doctors think the effectiveness of acupuncture remains uncertain, perhaps because the scientific basis for it remains so new. 
Recently, however, systematic scientific studies of acupuncture’s effects in such treatment has begun. 
Almost all trials on acupuncture as a treatment for stroke conducted within China have been positive. 
But another recent study done in the UK showed that research conducted in several countries was uniformly favorable to acupuncture as a treatment for the damage caused by stroke. 
Indeed, all the trials performed before June 1995 in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were deemed positive by the British researchers. 
The Cochrane Collaboration, an international non-profit organization providing healthcare information, conducted a systematic review of the benefits of acupuncture, including 14 trials, of which 10 were conducted in China, involving 1,208 patients. 
Acupuncture started within 30 days of stroke onset, with control groups receiving a placebo – sham acupuncture – or no treatment. 
Compared to patients who received sham acupuncture or no treatment, far fewer of those who received acupuncture died or became invalid within three months. 
After three months or more of treatment, the numbers rose even more significantly in favor of those treated by acupuncture. 
Oddly, when comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, the statistical difference concerning death or the need for institutional care was small. 
Indeed, another analysis, including 14 randomized trials with 1,213 patients six months after a stroke, compared the effects of conventional stroke rehabilitation with and without acupuncture as a supplement. 
Acupuncture was found to have no additional effect on motor recovery, but a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo effect, or to the varied quality of the trials. 
Indeed, the efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies—a problem that has affected most of trials undertaken so far. 
For example, many trials did not describe their method of measuring statistical relevance, and only called themselves “randomized controlled trials.” 
Only four trials, with 373 patients, could provide data on death or dependency (becoming dependent on others for activities of daily living). 
And only three trials—all conducted in Europe—used sham acupuncture as a control, whereas no acupuncture trials controlled with placebos or sham acupuncture have been reported in China, owing to high cultural barriers. 
Part of the problem in China is choosing the patients to be studied. 
After all, patients come to hospitals that practice traditional Chinese medicine because they already believe in acupuncture and are likely to be using it to treat another illness. 
Getting such patients to accept being put into a control group where no acupuncture is applied is almost impossible. 
This difficulty makes random studies of the effects of acupuncture treatment on stroke patients particularly difficult in a traditional Chinese medicine hospital. 
More fundamentally, however, Chinese doctors who use traditional medicine argue that outcome measures of acupuncture as a treatment for stroke should be different from conventional measures used in Western trials, because the theory of acupuncture is different. 
But no one has yet specified what the appropriate outcome measures for acupuncture should be. 
A recent study conducted in China, including 862 patients who were between the second and tenth day after onset of acute stroke, is the largest truly randomized trial using death or dependency as the primary outcome. 
The patients were randomly allocated to an acupuncture group receiving acupuncture treatment plus routine treatment or a control group receiving routine treatment alone. 
The results will be reported after analysis of the trial data and could prove useful for therapy of stroke patients. 
At present, however, there is insufficient evidence for routine use of acupuncture in stroke. 
More high-quality trials are needed. 
We do know that acupuncture is a safe, inexpensive, widely accepted, and potentially effective therapy. 
Particularly at a time when standard rehabilitation is not available for most Chinese stroke patients, few will wait to try acupuncture until its role is confirmed or refuted by reliable evidence. 
The Scientific Men's Club 
I serve on the senior appointments and promotions committee of a medical school. 
Over the years, I've come to recognize something that is as disturbing as it is undeniable: as a group, male basic scientists sail through the committee effortlessly. 
Many work in fields so specialized that they have only ten colleagues in the entire world, half of whom are their mentors or one-time fellow graduate students. 
These are their "peers," and they readily provide laudatory letters of recommendation establishing that the applicant has attained "national and international recognition." 
In contrast, applications by clinical faculty and women provoke far more discussion. 
I don't resent the ease with which basic science faculty are promoted; after all, I am sure that I also enjoyed the perks that come with this designation. 
Nonetheless, the system seems blatantly unfair. 
We rely on external referees for promoting basic scientists, who publish their work in national or international journals. 
By contrast, it is difficult to quantify how good clinical scientists are. 
Indeed, we struggle--more or less successfully, I think--even to define what a "scholarly" practicing physician is, because a clinician's reputation rests on local interactions that are often difficult to document. 
The issue of women faculty members, especially in basic sciences, is far more complex. 
I suspect that here the problem reflects fundamental differences between the way women and men approach science as a microcosm of life. 
Most of my fellow male faculty members are not muscle-bound, testosterone-driven types, but in their scientific careers, they display two types of typically male behavior. 
The first is a compulsion to be the first to establish completely trivial facts about science. 
As I grow older, I'm no longer sure why this is so important, but the male members of our species seem to think that it is. 
Most young male faculty members have an obsessive need to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week to make sure that a (sometimes-illusory) competitor is beaten to the punch. 
Ten or 15 years from now, will anybody care? 
Most women in basic sciences seem to be uninterested from the outset in playing such games. 
The second male behavior is a patricidal imperative that is perhaps the most shameful and atavistic of the primal impulses that still lurk in some archaic part of our brains. 
The idea that one must somehow supplant one's mentor, cast the previous generation out into the wilderness, and make oneself the leader of the pack seems to obsess men. 
Women scientists seem to behave far more collegially. 
There is a certain senior (male) faculty member who is one of the kindest and most accomplished investigators at my institution. 
He is surrounded by and works with a group of young women he has mentored. 
Most are bright, creative, and productive in their own right, but they do not seek desperately to dissociate themselves from him, establish their own little fiefdoms elsewhere, and beat him at his own game. 
At the risk of sounding simplistic, I can't help feeling that working together as a group is an innately feminine tendency. 
More importantly, I can't help believing that this way of operating is ultimately far more scientifically productive than the traditional male drive to establish one's own "identity" and "independence." 
Unfortunately, one of the unwritten laws of academia--unquestioned by the committee on which I serve--is that a candidate who does not seek and grasp the holy grail of "independence" is not qualified to be promoted. 
Almost every time a woman candidate comes up before the committee, her "independence" is questioned in a way that is irrelevant, if not insulting. 
Sadder still, the most stringent adherents to and enforcers of this male paradigm are the rare women that have "made it" in the male world to serve on the committee. 
"I made it," they seem to say, "so why can't she?" 
In most cases, the women are as smart as the men, if not smarter. 
But most have chosen to work either in a group with their mentors or with their husbands, who often work in the same fields. 
Although they generate as many of the ideas as their male colleagues do, it is the latter who go to meetings and present the group's research results. 
This seems to me to reflect women's all-too-common impulse to accommodate the unbridled male ego rather than any deficiency in their creativity or "independence." 
There was surely a time when eschewing children and family was the only way that a woman could prove her commitment to science. 
In many places, that has begun to change. 
I hope that the time will come when there are enough women in science that a greater diversity of female role models is represented in bodies that decide about careers. 
This would encourage greater sympathy for and empathy with the different needs and impulses of women and men--and a deeper appreciation that the male paradigm is not the only valid one within which to live life and excel in science. 
The Scientific Road to Copenhagen 
BERLIN – On June 10, 1859, six months before Charles Darwin published his Origin of Species , the physicist John Tyndall demonstrated a remarkable series of experiments at the Royal Institution in London. 
The meeting was chaired by Prince Albert. 
But neither he, nor Tyndall, nor anyone in their distinguished audience could possibly have anticipated the extent to which the experiments’ results would preoccupy the world 150 years later. 
This month, thousands of people from all over the world, including many heads of state, will gather in Copenhagen to try to forge an agreement to drastically cut atmospheric emissions of an invisible, odorless gas: carbon dioxide. 
Despite efforts by some leading countries to lower expectations ahead of the conference about what can and will be achieved, the meeting is still being called the most important conference since World War II. 
And at the conference’s heart are the results of Tyndall’s experiments. 
But the story starts even before Tyndall, with the French genius Joseph Fourier. 
An orphan who was educated by monks, Fourier was a professor at the age of 18, and became Napoleon’s governor in Egypt before returning to a career in science. 
In 1824, Fourier discovered why our planet’s climate is so warm – tens of degrees warmer than a simple calculation of its energy balance would suggest. 
The sun brings heat, and earth radiates heat back into space – but the numbers did not balance. 
Fourier realized that gases in our atmosphere trap heat. 
He called his discovery l’effet de serre – the greenhouse effect. 
It was Tyndall who then put Fourier’s ideas to the test in his laboratory. 
He proved that some gases absorb radiant heat (today we would say long-wave radiation). 
One of these gases was CO2. 
In 1859, Tyndall described the greenhouse effect in beautifully concise words: “The atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat, but checks its exit; and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet.” 
Then, in 1897, Svante Arrhenius, who earned a Nobel Prize for chemistry six years later, calculated how much global warming a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere would cause. 
His answer was 4-6 degrees Celsius (a little more than the 2-4 degrees that modern studies consistently find). 
Arrhenius was not in the least troubled by the prospect of global warming. 
Perhaps because he was Swedish, he proposed setting coal mines on fire to speed it up, since he thought a warmer climate was an excellent idea. 
But it was all just theory in Arrhenius’s time, since nobody had measurements to prove that CO2 levels in the atmosphere were in fact increasing. 
That changed only in the late 1950’s, when Charles Keeling started to measure CO2 with unprecedented accuracy in Antarctica and on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, far away from any sources. 
By 1960, he was able to prove that CO2 was indeed on the rise. It then took only a few years until, in 1965, an expert report – the first of many – to US President Lyndon B. Johnson warned of global warming: “By the year 2000, the increase in carbon dioxide will be close to 25%. 
This may be sufficient to produce measurable and perhaps marked changes in climate.” 
In 1972, a more specific prediction was made in the leading science journal Nature , namely that temperatures would warm by half a degree Celsius by 2000. 
And, in 1979, the US National Academy of Sciences issued a stark warning of impending global warming. 
We did not have to wait until 2000 to find these predictions were correct: by the 1980’s, global warming became apparent in temperature measurements from weather stations around the world. 
In 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was founded to analyze the issue in more detail, and in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro world leaders signed a historic treaty: the Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
Its goal: “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” 
Unfortunately, little has been achieved in the 17 years since then. 
In fact, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels were almost 40% higher in 2008 relative to 1990. 
And even the rate at which emissions are increasing is now three times higher than in the 1990’s. 
Global temperatures had already risen by 0.5 ºC above preindustrial levels by the early 1990’s, and another 0.3ºC have been added to that since the Rio Earth Summit. 
And they keep rising. 
Most countries now agree that global warming should be stopped at a maximum of two degrees centigrade. 
But this has become an extremely tough challenge, as growth in greenhouse-gas emissions and atmospheric stocks accelerated in the years since Rio. 
That is why Copenhagen is so important: it may well be our last to address climate change before it addresses us. 
Tyndall’s measurements 150 years ago showed that carbon dioxide traps heat and causes warming. 
And, 50 years ago, Keeling’s measurements showed that CO2 levels are increasing. 
The Scoundrels of Economic Patriotism 
Samuel Johnson called patriotism “the last refuge of a scoundrel.” 
If that is true, what should we think of today’s mounting economic nationalism, sometimes euphemistically described as “economic patriotism”? 
Indeed, economic nationalism is exceptionally vigorous at the moment. 
Vigorous popular opposition to a Dubai company’s plan to take over ports in the United States shocked the American government. 
Poland is witnessing a populist backlash against foreign ownership of banks. 
France is blocking the acquisition of French utilities by the Italian electricity company Enel. 
Together with other European governments, France is also agitating against the takeover of the Luxembourg-based steel company Arcelor by a Netherlands company largely controlled by an Indian steel magnate. 
Defenders of these ill-fated cross-border takeovers worry that a sinister whiff of the twentieth century’s worst moments is in the air. 
An outraged Italian minister warned of a new mobilization of populist nationalism in an “August 1914” scenario. 
The better analogy is from the 1930’s: in 1933, the year in which Hitler came to power, the world’s most famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, produced a plea for “national self-sufficiency.” 
Both the 1914 and the 1933 analogies point to the most striking characteristic of the current debate: the key role of security worries in justifying protectionism. 
Nobody worried about foreign ownership of US ports as long as the owner was a British company; the new fears reflect the belief that Dubai might be a channel for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. 
Likewise, the deterioration of international relations before World Wars I and II was marked by governments’ increased propensity to use economics as a tool of power politics. 
In 1911, the diplomatic crisis over Morocco was accompanied by a French speculative attack on German financial markets. 
In the 1930’s, both France and Germany used this kind of technique as a way to bolster their own security. 
The US tried to control Japanese expansion in Asia by limiting Japan’s energy (especially petroleum) imports. 
The most obvious reason for increased worries about security in America is the challenge of meeting the threat of terrorism after the attacks of September 2001. 
But that can scarcely explain European nervousness and the protectionist reaction. 
In Europe’s case, two contrasting explanations exist. 
The first is that the new worries are a strange case of psychological transference. 
People in places like France and Poland who worry about national decline seek to blame somebody outside the country. 
There was certainly a great deal of this type of sentiment in the 1930’s, when the populist response to the Great Depression attributed it to the sinister forces of “international capital.” 
The modern version of this explanation holds that the world is changing so quickly that national security and, indeed, national identity, are under threat. 
An alternative scenario suggests that these fears emanate from a real problem. 
Modern economic growth still depends in almost every advanced industrial country on imported energy (Norway is an exception). 
Because of fears about pollution, or about the safety of nuclear energy, most countries neglected to build up their own capacity. 
The resulting vulnerability was highlighted by the Russian reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine in January, which resulted in reduced flows to central and western Europe. 
The experience made Poles particularly jittery, and pushed the country’s populist right-wing government down the road of economic nationalism. 
But West Europeans remember their own traumas, including electricity grid failures and widespread blackouts. 
Wouldn’t an Italian company facing grid failure prefer to shut down French rather than Italian consumers? 
These two scenarios of the origins of economic nationalism, one irrational and the other not, are not real alternatives, but describe responses that intertwine: the more rational the fear, the more that fear can be used as an instrument of politics. 
Fear creates a demand for state action. 
Politicians like this because it increases demand for their services. 
They point out the potential problem and then attempt to sell solutions that lie within their nationally defined spheres of competence. 
One modern politician, in particular, has been effective in placing nervousness about energy supply at the center of a new political vision. 
According to Vladimir Putin, the need to control and secure energy justifies a massive extension of state intervention in the economy. 
Putin’s vision was apparently vindicated by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US. 
Since then, Putin has projected his vision of politicized energy in a way that makes all Europeans, not just Russians, nervous. 
That bolsters his strength in the Russian setting. 
But a Putin in one country has a tendency to produce Putin imitators elsewhere. 
We should be concerned about the efficiency losses in markets where restrictions stemming from economic nationalism have so far been imposed. 
But we should be far more worried that fear about the collapse or manipulation of markets creates a demand for action that makes such a collapse more rather than less likely. 
Fear generates a demand for more security that is in the end paralyzing. 
The Search for Quality on the Web 
NEW YORK – In the not-so-distant future, students will be able to graduate from high school without ever touching a book. 
Twenty years ago, they could graduate from high school without ever using a computer. 
In only a few decades,amp#160;computer technology and the Internet have transformed the core principles of information, knowledge, and education. 
Indeed, today you can fit more books on the hard disk of your laptop computer than in a bookstore carrying 60,000 titles. 
The number of Web pages on the Internet is rumored to have exceeded 500 billion, enough to fill 10 modern aircraft carriers with the equivalent number of 500-page, one-pound books. 
Such analogies help us visualize the immensity of the information explosion and ratify the concerns that come with it. 
Web search engines are the only mechanism with which to navigate this avalanche of information, so they should not be mistaken for an optional accessory, one of the buttons to play with, or a tool to locate the nearest pizza store. 
Search engines are the single most powerful distribution points of knowledge, wealth, and yes, misinformation. 
When we talk about Web search, the first name that pops up is, of course, Google. 
It is not far-fetched to say that Google made the Internet what it is today. 
It shaped a new generation of people who are strikingly different from their parents. 
Baby boomers might be the best placed to appreciate this, since they experienced Rock 'n’ Roll as kids and Google as parents. 
Google’s design was based on statistical algorithms. 
But search technologies that are based on statistical algorithms cannot address the quality of information, simply because high-quality information is not always popular, and popular information is not always high-quality. 
You can collect statistics until the cows come home, but you cannot expect statistics to produce an effect beyond what they are good for. 
In addition, statistics collection systems are backward-looking. 
They need time for people to make referrals, and time to collect them. 
Therefore, new publications and dynamic pages that change their content frequently are already beyond the scope of the popularity methods, and searching this material is vulnerable to rudimentary techniques of manipulation. 
For example, the inefficiencies of today’s search engines have created a new industry called Search Engine Optimization, which focuses on strategies to make Web pages rank high against the popularity criteria of Google-esque search engines. 
It is a billion-dollar industry. 
If you have enough money, your Web page can be ranked higher than many others that are more credible or higher quality.amp#160;Since the emergence of Google, quality information has never been so vulnerable to the power of commercialism. 
Information quality, molded in the shadow of Web search, will determine the future of mankind, but ensuring quality will require a revolutionary approach, a technological breakthrough beyond statistics.amp#160;This revolution is underway, and it is called semantic technology. 
The underlying idea behind semantic technology is to teach computers how the world operates. 
For example, when a computer encounters the word “bill,” it would know that “bill” has 15 different meanings in English. 
When the computer encounters the phrase “killed the bill,” it would deduce that “bill” can only be a proposed law submitted to a legislature, and that “kill” could mean only “stop.” 
By contrast, “kill bill” would only be the title of the movie by that name. 
At the end, a series of deductions like these would handle entire sentences and paragraphs to yield an accurate text-meaning representation. 
To achieve this level of dexterity in handling languages by computer algorithms, an ontology must be built. 
Ontology is neither a dictionary nor a thesaurus. 
It is a map of interconnected concepts and word senses that reflect relationships such as those that exist between the concepts of “bill” and “kill.” 
Building an ontology encapsulating the world’s knowledge may be an immense task, requiring an effort comparable to compiling a large encyclopedia and the expertise to build it, but it is feasible. 
Several start-up companies around the world, like Hakia , Cognition Search , and Lexxe , have taken on this challenge. 
The result of these efforts remains to be seen. 
But how would a semantic search engine solve the information quality problem? 
The answer is simple: precision. 
Once computers can handle natural languages with semantic precision, high-quality information will not need to become popular before it reaches the end user, unlike what is required by Web search today. 
Semantic technology promises other means of assuring quality, by detecting the richness and coherence of the concepts encountered in a given text. 
If the text includes a phrase like “Bush killed the last bill in the Senate,”amp#160;does the rest of the text include coherent concepts? 
Or is this page a spam page that includes a bunch of popular single-liners wrapped with ads? 
Semantic technology can discern what it is. 
Given humans’ limited reading speed (200-300 words per minute) and the enormous volume of available information, effective decision-making today calls for semantic technology in every aspect of knowledge refinement. 
We cannot afford a future in which knowledge is at the mercy of popularity and money. 
The Second Coming of Barack Obama 
WASHINGTON, DC – The race was tough, but US President Barack Obama has won re-election. 
The question now, for the United States and the world, is what will he do with a fresh four-year term? 
To win re-election with a still-weak economy and unemployment close to 8% was not easy. 
Many leaders – Nicolas Sarkozy, Gordon Brown, and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero come to mind – have been swept away by economic discontent in recent years. 
Although the financial disaster erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, after eight years of a Republican presidency, Obama had to carry the burden of an anemic recovery. 
Obama won not only because of his extraordinary personal resilience, but also because a sufficient number of middle-class voters, while unhappy with the pace of economic progress, sensed that an Obama presidency would help them more than the policies championed by his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, which were perceived as tilted to the affluent. 
Moreover, America’s ongoing demographic transformation makes it harder for candidates who are unable to reach out strongly to Latinos and other minority communities – something that Romney singularly failed to do – to carry the country. 
Some aspects of the campaign, particularly the amount of money spent and its negative tone, struck many observers as objectionable. 
But the competitiveness of American democracy – the fact that an alternative always exists, and that those in power have to fight hard to stay there – was on admirable display for the whole world to see. 
Obama will embark on his second term with the global economy at a crossroads. 
In the US, the uneven and weak recovery has been sustained by extraordinarily expansive monetary policies and ongoing large fiscal deficits. 
While corporate coffers hold mountains of cash, private investment stagnates. 
In Japan, solid economic performance remains elusive, while prime ministers succeed each other at a breathtaking pace. 
Likewise, Europe is on life support, thanks to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s astute maneuvering and promises of unlimited intervention in sovereign-debt markets. 
But unemployment is at its highest in decades and growth has essentially stalled, even in Germany, while the troubled southern economies are mired in deep recession. 
The situation in Greece, moreover, has become socially unsustainable; 
Greece is small, but a total collapse there could have very negative financial and psychological effects elsewhere. 
The world’s emerging-market economies are in better shape; but, while their underlying trend growth in potential output is much higher than that of the advanced economies, there is no cyclical de-coupling. 
The world economy is an interdependent whole: trouble in any important part of it is transmitted globally. 
That is true beyond the purview of narrowly macroeconomic problems as well: for example, the need to address climate change can no longer be ignored. 
The US cannot determine the world economy’s future on its own, but the course taken by America nonetheless has huge global importance, given that it remains the largest economy and retains considerable influence in venues such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the G-20. 
American ideas continue to affect the policy debate worldwide. 
So, what should Obama’s top economic-policy priorities be in his second term? 
Despite the difficulties facing the global economy, there are huge investible resources in the US, China, Germany, and elsewhere. 
While there are climate and resource constraints, we are still at the beginning of a technological revolution that holds tremendous potential for higher productivity and greater prosperity, along with challenging implications for labor and employment. 
But sustainable economic growth requires that those with investible resources actually invest them. 
And that will not happen unless and until a broad-based recovery of the middle- and lower-income groups in advanced economies, including the US, delivers the prolonged rebound in demand for which investors are waiting. 
There are plenty of profits to be made – actual taxes on capital are not too high, and cheap finance is available to the corporate sector. 
But the concentration of income at the top – more than 90% of the gains from US economic growth in 2011, for example, went to the top 1% – is constraining broad-based recovery and leaving macroeconomic policy caught between the need for continued “stimulus” and the dangers of growing public debt and asset bubbles inflated by record-low interest rates. 
In other words, a more balanced income distribution is not only a social or ethical issue; it is crucial for macroeconomic and, indeed, long-term corporate success. 
This is vital for many countries, above all the US and China. 
Then there is the pressing need – in the US and globally – for education and appropriate skill formation. 
Without the skills required by new and incipient technologies, too many workers will simply be unemployable. 
A key benefit of prioritizing broad-based quality education is that it also helps to solve the income-distribution problem. 
Finally, there is the need for effective international cooperation. 
China’s current-account surplus has declined, but now northern Europe runs a $500 billion surplus, while demand in southern Europe is collapsing and the US is running a deficit that is close to $500 billion. 
The longer-term challenge of climate change and extreme weather patterns also requires global cooperation and a post-election shift toward much stronger US engagement, which could unleash a multifaceted clean-energy revolution, fueling large job-creating investments and a new cycle of growth. 
After America’s long, hard-fought election campaign, it is time for comprehensive policy reforms. 
One hopes that the US Congress will recognize this as well, leading to support for measures that could help hundreds of millions of people in the US and around the world. 
The Second Great Contraction 
CAMBRIDGE – Why is everyone still referring to the recent financial crisis as the “Great Recession”? 
The term, after all, is predicated on a dangerous misdiagnosis of the problems that confront the United States and other countries, leading to bad forecasts and bad policy. 
The phrase “Great Recession” creates the impression that the economy is following the contours of a typical recession, only more severe – something like a really bad cold. 
That is why, throughout this downturn, forecasters and analysts who have tried to make analogies to past post-war US recessions have gotten it so wrong. 
Moreover, too many policymakers have relied on the belief that, at the end of the day, this is just a deep recession that can be subdued by a generous helping of conventional policy tools, whether fiscal policy or massive bailouts. 
But the real problem is that the global economy is badly overleveraged, and there is no quick escape without a scheme to transfer wealth from creditors to debtors, either through defaults, financial repression, or inflation. 
A more accurate, if less reassuring, term for the ongoing crisis is the “Second Great Contraction.” 
Carmen Reinhart and I proposed this moniker in our 2009 book This Time is Different, based on our diagnosis of the crisis as a typical deep financial crisis, not a typical deep recession. 
The first “Great Contraction” of course, was the Great Depression, as emphasized by Anna Schwarz and the late Milton Friedman. 
The contraction applies not only to output and employment, as in a normal recession, but to debt and credit, and the deleveraging that typically takes many years to complete. 
Why argue about semantics? 
Well, imagine you have pneumonia, but you think it is only a bad cold. 
You could easily fail to take the right medicine, and you would certainly expect your life to return to normal much faster than is realistic. 
In a conventional recession, the resumption of growth implies a reasonably brisk return to normalcy. 
The economy not only regains its lost ground, but, within a year, it typically catches up to its rising long-run trend. 
The aftermath of a typical deep financial crisis is something completely different. 
As Reinhart and I demonstrated, it typically takes an economy more than four years just to reach the same per capita income level that it had attained at its pre-crisis peak. 
So far, across a broad range of macroeconomic variables, including output, employment, debt, housing prices, and even equity, our quantitative benchmarks based on previous deep post-war financial crises have proved far more accurate than conventional recession logic. 
Many commentators have argued that fiscal stimulus has largely failed not because it was misguided, but because it was not large enough to fight a “Great Recession.” 
But, in a “Great Contraction,” problem number one is too much debt. 
If governments that retain strong credit ratings are to spend scarce resources effectively, the most effective approach is to catalyze debt workouts and reductions. 
For example, governments could facilitate the write-down of mortgages in exchange for a share of any future home-price appreciation. 
An analogous approach can be done for countries. 
For example, rich countries’ voters in Europe could perhaps be persuaded to engage in a much larger bailout for Greece (one that is actually big enough to work), in exchange for higher payments in ten to fifteen years if Greek growth outperforms. 
Is there any alternative to years of political gyrations and indecision? 
In my December 2008 column, I argued that the only practical way to shorten the coming period of painful deleveraging and slow growth would be a sustained burst of moderate inflation, say, 4-6% for several years. 
Of course, inflation is an unfair and arbitrary transfer of income from savers to debtors. 
But, at the end of the day, such a transfer is the most direct approach to faster recovery. 
Eventually, it will take place one way or another, anyway, as Europe is painfully learning. 
Some observers regard any suggestion of even modestly elevated inflation as a form of heresy. 
But Great Contractions, as opposed to recessions, are very infrequent events, occurring perhaps once every 70 or 80 years. 
These are times when central banks need to spend some of the credibility that they accumulate in normal times. 
The big rush to jump on the “Great Recession” bandwagon happened because most analysts and policymakers simply had the wrong framework in mind. 
Unfortunately, by now it is far too clear how wrong they were. 
Acknowledging that we have been using the wrong framework is the first step toward finding a solution. 
History suggests that recessions are often renamed when the smoke clears. 
Perhaps today the smoke will clear a bit faster if we dump the “Great Recession” label immediately and replace it with something more apt, like “Great Contraction.” 
The Secret Language of Central Bankers 
“If I seem unduly clear to you,” Alan Greenspan said to his political masters in the United States Congress, “you must have misunderstood what I said.” It was 1987, and the newly-confirmed chair of the Federal Reserve was elaborating on how he had “learned to mumble with great incoherence” in the short months since he had “become a central banker.” 
Mr. Greenspan was a strong believer, in practice if not in theory – for who could understand his theory? – that central bankers should speak in an opaque and convoluted dialect. 
In comparison, the Oracle at Delphi’s advice to the King of Lydia – “If you attack Persia, you will destroy a great kingdom” – is clarity itself. 
There was an old argument for “Greenspanese”: voters or politicians or both are inherently short-sighted and myopic. 
They would always see and want to grasp the benefits of lower interest rates and a little more demand pressure – more production, more employment, higher wages, and higher profits in the short run. 
But they would either not see or be cynically indifferent to the problems of stagflation that would inevitably follow. 
The job of the central bank, according to Greenspan’s distant predecessor, William McChesney Martin, was to “take away the punchbowl [of low interest rates] before the party really gets going.” 
But, the argument went, the Fed could not say that this was what it was doing in clear and transparent language, for, if voters and politicians could understand central bankers, they would then force them into following destructive inflationary policies that would be worse for everyone, at least in the long run. 
By using an opaque and convoluted idiom, the only outsiders – reporters, politicians, and academics – who would be able to understand what the central bank was saying would be those who had carefully studied the issues and the language. 
This, in turn, would lead them all (with the rare exception of a maverick critic like William Greider) to understand and approve, and to agree that talking in “Greenspanese” is essential for enabling central banks to ensure price stability. 
There seems to be general agreement today that this argument no longer applies, if it was ever truly valid. 
Voters and politicians today, it seems, fear inflation and are willing to accept occasional economic recessions and unemployment above its natural rate as unfortunate but inevitable consequences of the necessary and beneficial pursuit of long-term price stability. 
The debate about monetary policy can thus be fruitful and productive even if it is no longer restricted to those who have learned “Greenspanese.” 
Thus, all across the North Atlantic core of the world economy, central banks have embarked on a “transparency” initiative to make their organization’s goals, guesses, procedures, and policies more widely and clearly known. 
They are relying on economists’ basic predisposition to believe that more information is always better than less, that individuals are good judges of what they need to know, and that they are able to evaluate and place in perspective what they know. 
But recently – and increasingly so in recent months – central bankers’ doubts about the utility of the transparency initiative have increased. 
The more central banks talk, and the clearer they try to make their language, the more it seems that markets may be reacting excessively and inappropriately to statements that are not really news at all. 
More information may be leading not to better knowledge, but to more confusion. 
We economists have a hard time figuring out why there appears to be so much static on the communications line. 
Why were so many people in financial markets so sure that the Fed’s late-March meeting statement heralded a likelihood of interest-rate hikes soon, rather than being simply an acknowledgement (as the Fed explicitly stated) that what had been very unlikely was now a possibility? 
Why are cable TV personalities so eager to overstate how quickly central banks change their view of the likely future? 
Why do participants in financial markets trade on the advice of cable TV personalities when a small amount of number-crunching reveals that the benefits must be lower than the transactions costs incurred by over-frequent trading? 
We don’t have answers to these questions. 
So we really don't know whether we should tell central bankers to brush up on their Greenspanese. 
The Secret of Harvard’s Success 
AHMEDABAD, INDIA – No country dominates any industry as much as the United States dominates higher education. 
According to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University’s Academic Ranking of World Universities, for example, 17 of the world’s 20 best universities are American, with Harvard topping the list by a substantial margin. 
The traditional explanation for this phenomenon – America’s wealth, large population, generous research funding, widespread private philanthropy, and ability to attract scholars from around the world – is incomplete. 
Although the US boasts the world’s largest economy, it comprises only one-quarter of global GDP, and possesses roughly one-twentieth of the world’s population. 
And its support for research is not unique. 
Moreover, according to the accepted explanation, large countries such as France, Germany, Japan, and even China and India should also be represented at the top of global university rankings. 
But they appear only sparsely anywhere in such rankings, if even at all. 
In fact, these countries lack a crucial piece of the puzzle: America’s innovative governance model for higher education. 
Harvard was established as a public institution in 1636 by the authorities of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. 
Its value to Massachusetts is exemplified in the Commonwealth’s post-independence state constitution, ratified in 1780, which includes a section about the university’s function and boundaries. 
When Harvard alumni dominated the Massachusetts legislature, the university was given support and consideration. 
But, in the 1840’s, mass immigration, fueled by the Irish potato famine, altered the state’s demographic balance, enabling populists to gain control of the legislature. 
Almost immediately, Harvard came under attack for being too elitist, too exclusive, and too expensive. 
Even its curriculum was challenged. 
Over the next two decades, the state increasingly impeded Harvard’s functioning by, for example, refusing to release funds and obstructing the appointment of professors. 
This behavior culminated in 1862, when the legislature blocked a university president’s appointment. 
In response, Harvard requested that it be placed “out of the reach of ordinary political strife and change” and into the “hands of alumni who have the interests of education most at heart.” 
On April 29, 1865, this radical proposal scraped through the Massachusetts General Court (the state’s bi-cameral legislature), owing to intense lobbying and the goodwill generated by Harvard alumni’s distinguished service for the Union during the Civil War. 
Since then, Harvard’s Board of Overseers, has been controlled exclusively by alumni. 
Inspired by Harvard’s success, other universities – starting with Yale University and the College of William and Mary – took similar action. 
This “genuine American method,” as Charles William Eliot, Harvard’s longest-serving president, called it, became the norm not only for private universities, but also for public institutions, such as the University of Michigan and Purdue University, and even religious institutions like the University of Notre Dame and Duke University. 
Today, 19 of the top 20 American universities in US News and World Report’s much-watched rankings are controlled by alumni (defined as 50% or more representation on the Board of Trustees). 
The only exception, the California Institute of Technology, has a board with 40% alumni representation. 
Of the top five, three (Harvard, Yale, and Columbia) are managed entirely by alumni, and two (Princeton and Stanford) are under 90% alumni control. 
Alumni run the show even at public institutions such as Purdue (90%) and Michigan (63%). 
On average, alumni make up 63% of the boards of the top 100 US universities, both public and private. 
In general, a higher percentage of alumni on the board is associated with a higher ranking, increased selectivity, and a larger endowment. 
After all, no group cares more about a university’s prestige than its alumni, who gain or lose esteem as their alma mater’s ranking rises or falls. 
Indeed, alumni have the most incentive to donate generously, and to manage the university effectively. 
Given their intimate knowledge of the university, alumni are also the most effective leaders. 
Through alumni networks, board members can acquire information quickly and act upon it without delay. 
All great universities are nonprofit organizations, created to administer higher education, which benefits society as a whole. 
But US universities found a way to integrate competition’s benefits into the European concept of nonprofit, or so-called eleemosynary, corporations. 
The lack of profit does not diminish an alumni-dominated board’s incentive to compete for prestige by, for example, hiring distinguished faculty, accepting meritorious students, and striving for athletic or artistic achievement. 
Using alumni to infuse the benefits of competition into nonprofit institutions exemplifies the genius of American adaptation. 
Countries that aspire to compete with US universities should take note. 
The Secret Policeman’s Fall 
As Hungary’s Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany found out when a recorded admission that his government was lying incited riots, openness in government doesn’t come easily in Eastern Europe’s new democracies. 
Like Hungary, post-communist Romania has struggled to increase transparency and honesty in what was once one of the world’s most closed societies. 
As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office. 
But there has, at last, been real movement towards openness – progress recognized by the European Union when it gave Romania the green light to join the European Union at the beginning of 2007. 
Aside from achieving what the EU now deems a “functioning market economy,” key political and legal changes, which I have overseen as Minister of Justice, range from increased transparency and control in the funding of political parties to a shakeup of the judiciary. 
Judicial reforms are, in turn, helping to root out corruption. 
Indictments have been issued against former and current cabinet ministers, members of parliament, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police and customs officers, and other public officials, as well as directors of private companies. 
In addition, new standardized forms have been introduced for declarations of assets and financial interests by anyone who holds an official position in government, parliament, public and local administration, and the judicial system. 
The new declarations are the most detailed in Europe, and, more importantly, they are published. 
Romania’s progress is confirmed in a report released earlier this month showing that citizens’ access to government information in Eastern Europe is now equal to that in established democracies. 
Indeed, the report, Transparency and Silence, conducted by the Open Society Justice Initiative (available at www.justiceinitiative.org), indicates that in some ways the new democracies have something to teach the old: certain government agencies in Romania were more responsive to citizen requests for information than comparable agencies in France and Spain. 
Specifically, 60% of the requests filed in Romania met, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain. 
Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania. 
But getting access to sensitive information in transitional democracies is not always easier, as I know from my previous work as a human rights lawyer with the Romanian Helsinki Committee. 
Often we had to go to court to force disclosure of information, using Romania’s 2001 Freedom of Information Act. 
For example, even when we won a case regarding access to the records of wiretaps authorized by the general prosecutor, the prosecutor simply ignored the court order. 
We filed a civil action against the prosecutor, and the judge imposed a fine for every day the information was withheld. 
But it was only when we caught the media’s attention that the data – detailing the number of wiretaps authorized over the previous 10 years, against whom, and for how long – were released. 
With its publication, Romania began to move away from its Securitate-dominated past. 
Now, inside government, I realize that sharing information with the public is sometimes hard. 
But when painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative. 
We could not have achieved the economic and political reforms that qualified us for EU membership if we had not subjected policymaking to public scrutiny and accepted the increased public participation in decision-making that inevitably accompanies such openness. 
Indeed, this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world. 
When the United States adopted its Freedom of Information Act in 1966, it joined the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland. 
Today, roughly 65 countries have such laws. 
In Romania, those who fought for a freedom of information law have made full use of it. 
As part of the Justice Initiative study, those who request information from Romania’s government were willingly supplied with the kind of information that would have been unthinkable to release just a few short years ago. 
The Romanian Defense Ministry, for example, disclosed the number of armed forces personnel who died in 2003, as well as the causes of death (including 13 suicides, two shootings, and two combat deaths in Afghanistan). 
Likewise, the Bucharest court was asked for the number of judges disciplined since the beginning of 2000, including grounds for any sanctions applied. 
The Court transferred the request to the Superior Council of Magistrates, which provided a full response: a four-page list of all sanctioned judges, with details of the reasons and penalties. 
Such information is both a product and a motor of continuing reform. 
It has not always been comfortable for those in government, and there is still a tug-of-war over sensitive documents. 
But, in the former communist bloc, the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable. 
At the same time, Romania’s experience demonstrates that official secrecy remains a threat to the core values of democratic governance, and that only constant vigilance, in both established and young democracies, can prevent its encroachment. 
The Secret World of Female Circumcision 
NAIROBI – As a child in rural Kenya, I was a secret admirer of female genital mutilation. 
I was swayed by talk of friends and elders about how once a girl undergoes “the cut,” she gains respect and grown men consider her suitable for marriage. 
Perhaps these were the reasons why, as a girl of 13, I longed to be “circumcised” and become a “real woman.” 
My mother opposed the practice, however, because she was (and remains) a Christian and wanted me to become educated and to escape the fate of many girls in my community who are married off to older men and then lose their autonomy. 
I tried to persuade my mother to permit my circumcision, but she refused. 
My mother’s decision angered me. 
In frustration, I spoke with a few other schoolgirls. 
Each of them gave a different version of the process, but they held a common view: circumcision is intensely painful, and I must be prepared for much bleeding. 
And yet the friends to whom I spoke encouraged me to get circumcised. 
So one August, during my school holidays, I decided to learn more about female genital circumcision. 
I decided to witness a girl undergoing the practice, and perhaps see her cry and bleed. 
If possible, I would talk to her later in order to gain a clearer picture of her experience. 
I went ahead with my plan and witnessed a girl being circumcised. 
The experience changed my life, but not in the way I expected. 
Before the operation, traditional heroic songs were sung, while a few older women sharpened their knives, preparing for the task ahead. 
They also prepared special herbs for use as disinfectants. 
I paid little attention to their preparations, actually. 
My eyes were fixed on Lillian, a girlfriend who was waiting to be cut. 
When the women began their work, Lillian’s expression turned from giddy anticipation to fear and then panic. 
I thought she might change her mind and run for her life. 
I was mistaken. 
She sat on a traditional stool and spread her legs wide apart. 
An old woman bent over her, knife in hand. 
I looked away and heard a sharp scream. 
The scream was swallowed by cheers from scores of women watching Lillian with me. 
They celebrated Lillian’s mutilation, while I mourned her loss. 
In my mind, Lillian was experiencing the worst moment of her life. 
In an instant, my view of female circumcision changed forever. 
While the women around me kept cheering, I resolved that from then on I would resist the practice with all my might. 
Because of my mother’s support, and my own determination, I succeeded in keeping my body intact. 
I went on to finish high school and then study journalism in a big city far from home. 
Today, living and working in cosmopolitan Nairobi, I look back with a mixture of horror and bemusement on my girlhood fascination with female circumcision. 
I escaped mutilation, but other girls from my rural Kenyan community continue to receive “the cut” to this day. 
Only last month, in Narok, the town nearest my childhood village, a 13-year-old girl died after undergoing circumcision as a preparation for her marriage to a man who already had five wives. 
When the girl died, her father and fiancé conspired to have her body secretly buried in the bush. 
Kenya’s police learned of the girl’s death and legal action is being prepared against the men. 
But punishment for the perpetrators of female circumcision remains rare. 
The practice persists, despite legal bans. 
As a child-welfare officer in Narok told me, “Unless attitudes are changed, efforts to stamp out the practice will be futile." 
Parents’ attitudes are changing, but slowly. 
Government can do more, of course. 
One new initiative calls for local leaders to be dismissed whenever high numbers of girls drop out of school. 
The logic is compelling: if girls remain in school, they can avoid “the cut” and early marriage. 
Once educated, these girls may decide for themselves – as I did – to resist mistreatment at the hands of their family and neighbors. 
At the same time, much more needs to be done to combat the practice, in Kenya and everywhere in Africa where it continues. 
International opposition helps. 
For decades, activists in the United States and Europe have brought attention to the problem and urged African governments to prosecute perpetrators. 
Nevertheless, because female genital mutilation is tied to a wider set of traditional practices involving the control of girls’ bodies and minds, and because these traditions have a powerful hold on some Africans, ultimately the practice can be halted only through concerted efforts by Africans themselves. 
Only if we change the views of our friends and neighbors can more girls escape “the cut” – and never long for it. 
The Secular and Sacred in Europe's Constitution 
One controversy surrounding the draft constitution for the European Union is whether or not to include an explicit reference to Europe's Christian heritage in its preamble. 
Silvio Ferrari, a noted scholar of Church‑State relations, dissects the issues. 
Europe's churches may be empty, but religion still incites heated debate, this time about its place in Europe's constitution. 
Some people demand that the constitution include some explicit reference to Europe's Christian heritage. 
Others want Europe to affirm its secular nature. 
What role should the secular and the sacred play in the European Union's fundamental law? 
Unsurprisingly, religious freedom is given prominence in the draft constitution. 
Every European citizen has the right to practice the religion of his or her choice, to adopt another religion, or to practice no religion. 
Underlying this notion is the paramount position of individual conscience, which carries with it the right of every person to make his or her own decisions on religious matters, without that choice resulting in negative legal consequences. 
Whether Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox, believer or atheist, civil and political rights must be equally apportioned regardless of a citizen's choice of religion or conscience. 
The second guiding principle concerns the autonomy of religious communities. 
The EU recognizes the "identity and specific contribution" of churches to European life. 
That language is, of course, a little vague, but it means that religious communities have characteristics that distinguish them from other associations and institutions‑‑and that Europe is prepared to respect these distinctions. 
Article 37 of the draft constitution establishes that a "regular dialogue" will be maintained between the Union and Europe's religious communities (as well as philosophical and non‑confessional organizations). 
Separation of church and state does not mean mutual ignorance. 
The common good benefits more from open, transparent dialogue than by turning a deaf ear to religion‑‑that is, provided that the borders between religion and politics are clearly defined. 
The state's laicité ‑‑fundamental in most European countries‑‑does not require isolating churches in political ghettoes. 
Finally, the EU undertakes to respect and not prejudice "the status under national law of churches and religious associations or communities in the Member States." 
In other words, the boundaries of religious autonomy and cooperation with churches are matters that should primarily be framed in law by the EU's members. 
This means that the EU will not interfere with the national systems of church‑state relations that now exist, and will refrain from imposing a common model of church‑state relations. 
Poland and Italy can maintain their concordats with the Catholic Church, France will not be compelled to abandon its century‑long separation of church and state, and Queen Elizabeth II can continue to head the Church of England. 
Defining the church‑state system and its principal features is a right of the citizens of each EU member state. 
In essence, Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 37 of the draft Constitution reflect characteristics that are largely part of a common European heritage: religious liberty, autonomy of religious communities, church‑state cooperation, and respect for the specific differences in various member states. 
Of course, improvements are possible. 
Equal treatment of religious communities is not mentioned in the text prepared by the European Convention. 
Although granting equal treatment is primarily a task of EU states, omitting this principle from the Constitution endangers not only the principle of equality, but that of religious liberty as well. 
If there is no equality, religious liberty is at risk. 
Moreover, the nature of church‑state cooperation could, perhaps, be defined more explicitly by drawing clear distinctions between what constitutes the spiritual and the secular. 
Regular dialogue with religious communities, though a good thing, should not be extended to purely secular areas. 
It is here that efforts to include a reference to Europe's Judeo‑Christian heritage in the preamble of the Constitution must be considered dispassionately. 
Of course, European civilization arises from a synthesis of religious and humanistic values. 
The Judeo‑Christian tradition, the legacies of Greece and Rome, and the Enlightenment are all at the root of the way many Europeans regard their lives, although a long process of secularization has made it more difficult to discern this relationship. 
But mentioning a specific religious tradition in Europe's Constitution is dubious. 
It would be largely symbolic and, although symbols are important and help to foster unity, they are dangerous when they exclude and divide. 
A considerable part of Europe's Muslim community would certainly feel marginalized if such a reference were included in the future European Constitution, which will also be their Constitution. 
This would be a bonanza for Muslim fundamentalists, and could be exploited by all who want to prevent the development of a moderate, modern European Islam. 
The Security Trap 
CHICAGO – Even as the world becomes more integrated, the word “security” crops up again and again, as in “food security” or “energy security.” 
Typically, this means a country creating and controlling production facilities no matter what the cost. 
Thus, Arab countries grow water-hungry grain in the desert, and China acquires part ownership of oil companies in Sudan. 
Are these economically sensible actions? 
If not, what should the world do to reduce the need for them? 
Let’s start with ownership of foreign resources. 
One might think that a country that owns foreign oil can use the profits from sales to insulate its economy from high world oil prices. 
But this makes no economic sense. 
The world market prices oil according to its opportunity cost. 
Rather than subsidizing the price in the domestic oil market (and thus giving domestic manufacturers and consumers an incentive to use too much oil), it would make far better sense to let the domestic price rise to the international price and distribute the windfall profits from foreign oil assets to the population. 
The key point is that fundamental economic decisions should not be affected by the ownership of additional foreign oil assets. 
But, because of political pressure exerted by small, powerful interest groups, windfall profits will inevitably be spent at home in unwise subsidies. 
As a result, the acquiring country will, if anything, make suboptimal economic decisions. 
Could the purchase of foreign resources lead to smoother national income? 
A purchase will always look beneficial if one looks backward after the resource price has risen. 
But if the price of oil falls, citizens suffer a loss of income and wealth (relative to having invested the money elsewhere). 
Assuming the foreign oil assets are priced fairly at the time of purchase, the country benefits only when the purchase helps smooth its income; however, purchases may increase income volatility even for a country that relies heavily on oil. 
For example, in large countries like the United States or China, which account for a significant portion of world demand, the world price of oil is likely to be high when the country is growing strongly and citizens have lots of income, whereas the price is likely to be low when the country is doing poorly. 
Foreign oil assets are a bad hedge in such cases, for they subtract from citizens’ income when it is already low and add to it when it is high. 
Even if owning oil assets is a useful hedge (as in a small, oil-consuming country), it is not clear that buying stakes in opaque companies in foreign countries is the best strategy. 
A country’s property rights in foreign oil assets are likely to diminish as the oil price rises. 
Even if the foreign company does not start squeezing out its minority owners, its government will be tempted to expropriate foreign owners through windfall taxes (if the government is sophisticated) or nationalization (if it is unsophisticated) – especially if its voters feel, with the benefit of hindsight and populist incitement, that the assets were sold too cheaply. 
But perhaps what countries really fear is not so much high prices but a total market breakdown and descent into an autarkic “Mad Max” world in which oil is scarce, no country is willing to allow trade in the oil it produces, and there is no world market clearing price. 
If such a situation were to occur, ownership of oil assets abroad would most likely become worthless, as each country would only get to use oil produced within its political borders (or within nearby borders that could be invaded). 
It is in this kind of world that seemingly nonsensical behavior like growing grain in the desert to ensure food security begins to make sense. 
Alternatives do need to be explored, including more efficient use, diversification into more easily accessible substitutes, and reduction of overall consumption (though in all these cases, it is easier to deal with energy shortages than food shortages). 
Moreover, even in such a bleak world, it is difficult to imagine the market breaking down completely or for long. 
Indeed, one can imagine black marketeers and smugglers buying where grain is available and transporting it to sell to countries where it is not. 
Unless governments build leak-proof barriers around their countries – and the costs would likely be prohibitive – an implicit world market would be re-established. 
Nevertheless, and understandably, many countries make decisions to locate production locally and to protect it against foreign trade, fearing market breakdown through war, trade sanctions, or simply shortsighted decisions by foreign governments to protect their own populations from price increases. 
Paradoxically, once a country ensures its own security, it has weaker incentives to avoid the market breakdown that prompts the initial search for security. 
International agreement to ensure that countries do not prohibit exports, especially of critical commodities, except under severely (and verifiably) adverse domestic circumstances, would help reduce fear of market breakdown. 
Similarly, the creation of international strategic resource reserves on neutral territory and under neutral management could help alleviate concerns about politically motivated disruptions. 
Unfortunately, all of this requires substantial international political consensus, cooperation, and goodwill – all of which are in short supply today. 
Until we find the collective will, the drive for national economic security will continue to lead to collective insecurity. 
The Service Revolution 
WASHINGTON, DC – China and India are both racing ahead economically. 
But the manner in which they are growing is dramatically different. 
Whereas China is a formidable exporter of manufactured goods, India has acquired a global reputation for exporting modern services. 
Indeed, India has leapfrogged over the manufacturing sector, going straight from agriculture into services. 
The differences in the two countries’ growth patterns are striking, and raise significant questions for development economists. 
Can service be as dynamic as manufacturing? 
Can late-comers to development take advantage of the increasing globalization of the service sector? 
Can services be a driver of sustained growth, job creation, and poverty reduction? 
Some facts are worth examining. 
The relative size of the service sector in India, given the country’s state of development, is much bigger than it is in China. 
Despite being a low-income region, India and other South Asian countries have adopted the growth patterns of middle- to high-income countries. 
Their growth patterns more closely resemble those of Ireland and Israel than those of China and Malaysia. 
India’s growth pattern is remarkable because it contradicts a seemingly iron law of development that has held true for almost 200 years, since the start of the Industrial Revolution. 
According to this “law” – which is now conventional wisdom – industrialization is the only route to rapid economic development for developing countries. 
As a result of globalization, the pace of development can be explosive. 
But the potential for explosive growth has usually been seen only in the manufacturing sector. 
This is no longer the case. 
There is evidence that countries with high growth in services also tend to have high overall economic growth; conversely, countries with high overall economic growth have high services growth. 
To be sure, the causal connection remains uncertain: after all, there is also a positive relationship – widely accepted in development economics – between manufacturing growth and overall growth. 
But what has been overlooked is that the effect of services growth on aggregate economic growth appears to be as strong, if not stronger, than the effect of manufacturing growth on overall growth. 
Moreover, the trend over time to a higher service-sector share in the economy suggests that higher real growth in services has not been offset by price declines. 
There is no outbreak of the so-called “Dutch disease” – that is, the price of services do not fall with an increase in the supply. 
India has a higher share of services, and more rapid service-sector growth, than China, although the latter is richer and has grown faster over time. 
This indicates that services are not simply responding to domestic demand (which would be higher in China), but also to export opportunities. 
India’s growth experience suggests that a global service revolution – rapid growth and poverty reduction led by services – is now possible. 
In India, the service sector has not only led overall economic growth, but is also characterized by higher labor productivity than in the industrial sector. 
Indeed, productivity growth in India’s service sector matches productivity growth in China’s manufacturing sector, thereby reducing poverty by enabling wages to rise. 
Service-led growth is sustainable, because globalization of services, which account for more than 70% of global output, is still in its infancy. 
Moreover, the long-held view that services are non-transportable, non-tradable, and non-scalable no longer holds for a host of modern impersonal services, which can now be produced and exported at low cost. 
Developing countries can thus sustain service-led growth, given the huge room they have for catch-up and convergence. 
India’s experience offers hope to other development late-comers. 
The process of globalization in the late twentieth century led to a sharp divergence of incomes between those who industrialized and broke into global markets and the “bottom billion” in some 60 countries where incomes stagnated for twenty years. 
It seemed as if the “bottom billion” would have to wait their turn for development, until giant industrializers like China became rich and uncompetitive in labor-intensive manufacturing. 
The globalization of services, however, provides alternative opportunities for developing countries to find niches, beyond manufacturing, where they can specialize, scale up, and achieve explosive growth, just like the industrializers. 
As the services produced and traded across the world expand with globalization, the possibilities for all countries to develop based on their comparative advantage expand. That comparative advantage can just as easily be in services as in manufacturing or agriculture. 
The promise of the service revolution is that countries do not have to wait to get on the path to rapid development. 
There is a new way ahead. 
The Seven-Year Ditch 
PRINCETON – There are historical precedents for sovereign-debt defaults by the countries of Europe’s southern periphery, but they are not instantly attractive ones. 
Dealing with seemingly intractable problems often takes time. 
And it is difficult – especially in a democracy – to be patient. 
The most obvious parallel to Europe’s current woes is the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980’s. 
In August 1982, Mexico threatened to default, and was quickly followed by other large borrowers, notably Argentina and Brazil. 
A default contagion would have brought down the banking systems of all the major industrial countries, and caused the world to relive something like the financial crisis of the Great Depression. 
What followed was a seven-year play for extra time. 
The initial approach was to link policy improvements in the borrowing countries not only with help from international institutions, but also with additional lending from the banks – which seemed to defy the most elementary canons of sensible bank behavior. 
Three years after the outbreak of the Latin American crisis, United States Treasury Secretary James Baker announced a systematization of the initial response. 
It was not very imaginative: Banks and multilateral development institutions should all lend more, and the debtors should continue their efforts to improve their macroeconomic policies. 
The Baker Plan was a universal disappointment. 
Growth faltered again, and the International Monetary Fund actually reduced its lending. 
More than three years passed before new US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady set out a more satisfactory program, in which banks would be given a menu of options that included lower interest rates on the debt and a hefty discount on the principal. 
If creditor banks were unwilling to accept some form of restructuring, they would have to put in new money. 
The lending of the international institutions might also be used for buying back discounted debt. 
Brady’s plan looked like a great success. 
Confidence returned, capital flight from Latin America was reversed, and capital markets became willing to provide financing again. 
Inevitably, the Brady Plan looks like a good model for southern Europe. 
Why not avoid seven years of misery, and begin some similar rescue operation now that could lead to a return to economic vigor and dynamism? 
The most obvious answer is that at an earlier stage in the Latin American saga, the banks simply could not have afforded to take such losses on their capital. 
They needed to fake it for seven years in order to build up adequate reserves against losses. 
The initiative for the Brady Plan did not come from the official sector at all. 
It was the willingness of some large financial institutions to trade in discounted debt that established a market that could clear out the legacy of past mistakes. 
Two institutions, in particular, took the lead: Citicorp in the US and Deutsche Bank in Europe. 
Their CEOs at the time presented their actions as being motivated by far-sighted benevolence and a concern for the well-being of the world as a whole. 
That may have been plausible, but the two banks also wanted to demonstrate publicly that they had better balance sheets than their weaker rivals. 
In Germany, the Dresdner Bank and the Landesbanken could not afford to take such a hit. 
Moreover, despite the obvious “reform fatigue” of Latin American electorates, the debtor countries had engaged in a substantial measure of reform. 
Before the Brady Plan was announced, Mexico had accepted a wide-ranging Pact of Economic Solidarity and Growth, which immediately improve investor confidence and reduced sky-high domestic interest rates. 
The final move to solve the debt problem came in the aftermath of international currency adjustment. 
One of the problems that had made the crisis more difficult after 1982 was the US dollar’s appreciation. 
Likewise, today’s euro crisis is harder to resolve because of the euro’s strength in currency markets. 
The dollar’s slide after 1985 made the real burden of Latin America’s dollar debt much lighter. 
Calling for a European Brady plan today does not guarantee the necessary conditions for such a plan to succeed. 
On all fronts, there has not been much progress. 
There is certainly plenty of frustration about the implementation of austerity, and no real indication of the long-term sustainability of reform efforts in southern Europe. 
The problems of Europe’s banks are also far from being resolved. 
A truly competitive European banking system would provide incentives for the larger and stronger banks to take more risks in the hope of growing even larger and stronger. 
But, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, policymakers are too pre-occupied by the real problems posed by too-big-to-fail banks, and too terrified by the potential collapse of weaker banks, to allow such a solution. 
Recapitalization has not yet reached the point where there are enough strong banks. 
Finally, global uncertainty about currencies stands in the way of a solution. 
The euro’s strength, despite the magnitude of the eurozone’s difficulties, makes an export-led recovery strategy harder to realize. 
The common currency’s strength reflects problems elsewhere in the world, but a euro exchange rate that would enable the return of confidence and growth is no less elusive for that. 
Without the preconditions that made the Brady Plan work, simply transplanting a debt write-off would only augment uncertainty and fuel the political revulsion that already threatens to undermine European integration. 
And it may be that Europe – because of its relative prosperity – is less in a mood for the biblical seven lean years than was a much poorer Latin America in the 1980’s. 
The Shadow of Depression 
BERKELEY – Four times in the past century, a large chunk of the industrial world has fallen into deep and long depressions characterized by persistent high unemployment: the United States in the 1930’s, industrialized Western Europe in the 1930’s, Western Europe again in the 1980’s, and Japan in the 1990’s. 
Two of these downturns – Western Europe in the 1980’s and Japan in the 1990’s – cast a long and dark shadow on future economic performance. 
In both cases, if either Europe or Japan returned – or, indeed, ever returns – to something like the pre-downturn trend of economic growth, it took (or will take) decades. 
In a third case, Europe at the end of the 1930’s, we do not know what would have happened had Europe not become a battlefield following Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland. 
In only one instance was the long-run growth trend left undisturbed: US production and employment after World War II were not significantly affected by the macroeconomic impact of the Great Depression. 
That is certainly how things looked, with high levels of structural unemployment and a below-trend capital stock, at the end of the 1930’s, before mobilization and the European and Pacific wars began in earnest. 
In the US, we can already see signs that the downturn that started in 2008 is casting its shadow on the future. 
Reputable forecasters – both private and public – have been revising down their estimates of America’s potential long-run GDP. 
For example, labor-force participation, which usually stops falling and starts rising after the business-cycle trough, has been steadily declining over the past two and a half years. 
At least some monetary policymakers believe that recent reductions in the US unemployment rate, which have largely resulted from falling labor-force participation, are just as valid a reason for shifting to more austere policies as reductions in unemployment that reflect increases in employment. 
And much the same processes and responses are at work – with even greater strength – in Europe. 
Most important, however, has been what looks, from today’s perspective, like a permanent collapse in the risk-bearing capacity of the private marketplace, and a permanent and large increase in the perceived riskiness of financial assets worldwide – and of the businesses whose cash flows underpin them. 
Given aging populations in industrial countries, large commitments from governments to social-insurance systems, and no clear plans for balancing government budgets in the long run, we would expect to see inflation and risk premiums – perhaps not substantial, but clearly visible – priced into even the largest and richest economies’ treasury debt. 
Sometime over the next generation, the price levels of the US, Japan, and Germany might rise substantially after some government short-sightedly attempts to finance some of its social-welfare spending by printing money. 
The price levels are unlikely to go down. 
Yet the desire to hold assets that avoid the medium-term risks associated with the business cycle has overwhelmed this long-run fundamental risk factor. 
But the risk that the world’s investors currently are trying to avoid by rushing into US, Japanese, and German sovereign debt is not a “fundamental” risk. 
There are no psychological preferences, natural-resource constraints, or technological factors that make investing in private enterprises riskier than it was five years ago. 
Rather, the risk stems from governments’ refusal, when push comes to shove, to match aggregate demand to aggregate supply in order to prevent mass unemployment. 
Managing aggregate demand is governments’ job. 
While Say’s law – the view that supply creates its own demand – is false in theory, it is true enough in practice that entrepreneurs and enterprises can and do depend on it. 
If the government falls down on the job, John Maynard Keynes wrote 76 years ago, and “demand is deficient…the individual enterpriser...is operating with the odds loaded against him. 
The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros,” which represent “the increment [by which] the world’s wealth has fallen short of...savings,” owing to “the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune. 
But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough.” 
For 62 years, from 1945-2007, with some sharp but temporary and regionalized interruptions, entrepreneurs and enterprisers could bet that the demand would be there if they created the supply. 
This played a significant role in setting the stage for the two fastest generations of global economic growth the world has ever seen. 
Now the stage has been emptied. 
The Shadow of the Crescent 
NEW YORK — As Pakistan atrophies in its existential crisis, a fundamental question about the nature of the country is coming to the fore: Are the country’s citizens Pakistanis who happen to be Muslims, or are they Muslims who happen to be Pakistanis? 
Which comes first, flag or faith? 
It is not a question that many Pakistanis can readily answer. The vast majority of the country’s so-called “educated elite” seem to have no qualms about identifying themselves as Muslims first and Pakistanis second. 
Some feel that their religion is the most important thing to them, and that that’s where their first loyalty will always lie. 
Others admit to having scant regard for religion, but say that Pakistan has come to mean so little to them that their religion supersedes their loyalty to the country. 
This willingness to subordinate state to God, even among the highly educated, lies at the heart of Pakistan’s crisis. 
How can a country be expected to prosper if the majority of its citizens harbor only a secondary allegiance to the state? 
How can it progress if, as the noted author M.J. Akbar wrote, “the idea of Pakistan is weaker than the Pakistani.” 
But what is the idea of Pakistan? 
Back in the heady days of the 1940’s, Mohammed Ali Jinnah rallied a people to nationhood. 
Despite his Anglophone status and Victorian manners, he carved out a separate homeland for India’s Muslims. 
But, today, an erudite, westernized lawyer like Jinnah who isn’t a wadhera or a jagirdar would find it impossible to win a popular election in Pakistan. 
For the real Jinnah is now irrelevant in the country that reveres him as “Quaid-e-Azam,” or founder of the nation. 
Few Pakistanis have the time or inclination to think about their founder’s ideas. 
Jinnah’s idea of Pakistan – South Asian Muslim nationalism – has been overrun by the dogma of Islamic universalism. 
The modern Pakistani identity is shaped largely by the negation of an Indian-Hindu identity and the adoption of a global pan-Islamic charter. 
Economic advancement is taken to mean Westernization or worse, Indianization. 
At every turn, Pakistanis seem more likely to unite as brothers in Islam than as sons of the same soil. 
Moreover, Pakistan’s fear of vilification and failure has given birth to an increasingly paranoid brand of Islam that seeks to impose stricter controls – on education, women’s rights, dancing, beardlessness, and sex – and close society to all forms of modernity. 
This paranoid Islam, represented by hard-line outfits like the Tablighi Jamaat, is Pakistan’s fastest-growing brand of faith. 
Pakistan is now at a crossroads, facing an uneasy moment of truth. 
To survive, its citizens must act in unison or risk seeing every moderate tendency in the country purged by a clamor of illiberal, religious voices. 
Today’s crisis calls for every thinking Pakistani to ask serious questions of themselves: What should be the idea of Pakistan? 
Are you Pakistanis who happen to be Muslims, Christians, or Hindus? 
Or are you members of a global Islamic ummah who just happen to live in Karachi or Lahore? 
The real challenge, and the ultimate solution, is to get people to think and talk about these questions. 
But this must be a debate between people, and within people. 
Nothing will be solved by searching for the “true Islam” or by quoting the Koran. 
The point is that eventually, despite strong regional loyalties and various cultural and religious differences, the majority can identify as being simply “Pakistani” – even though they may harbor radical differences about what this might mean. 
The real idea of Pakistan, ultimately, must be multiplicity. 
Today, we have come to understand ourselves as composites; often contradictory and internally incompatible. 
In the Babarnama , for example, we see the internal contradictions in the personality of the founder of the Mughal Empire. 
When describing his conquest of Chanderi in 1528, Babar offers gruesome details of the gory slaughter of many “infidels” but just a few sentences later he talks at length about Chanderi’s lakes, flowing streams, and sweet water. 
So who was Babar, bloodthirsty tyrant, humanist poet, or both – and not necessarily at odds with each other? 
Pakistan’s selfhood must be expanded ad maximum and made so capacious that it accommodates its Punjabis, Sindhis, Pathans, and Balochis, and their religions – Sunni, Shia, Hindu, Christian, Parsi, Qadhianis – until it is possible to call them all equally “Pakistani.” 
That must be the ultimate goal, and step one in the long, winding battle to save Pakistan. 
That is a national idea worth striving for – and Pakistan’s intellectuals, its elite, and its youth must be at the forefront of the battle. 
The Crescent has cast a seemingly interminable shadow across the length of Pakistan. 
Its tragedies and failings are a result of what is happening in God’s name, not Jinnah’s. 
To save Pakistan, Jinnah’s spirit, his moth-eaten ideals, must be renewed, and Pakistanis must ask themselves what Pakistan really means. 
The Shadow Plague 
The XIVth International Conference on AIDS in Barcelona last month put the global HIV epidemic back in the spotlight--justifiably so. 
The UN estimates that the number of HIV/AIDS sufferers, currently at 40 million, will rise sharply in coming years, and 25 million children under age 15 are expected to lose one or both parents to the disease by 2010. 
But the continuing spread of HIV is closely linked with the growing resurgence of a much older killer. 
Tuberculosis (TB) is an air-borne disease, transmitted the same way as common flu, by coughing or sneezing, although it is much less infectious. 
But, unlike flu, TB bacilli can survive in the lungs for years, surrounded by a "protective" wall built by the human immune system. 
These latent bacteria can be activated when other factors reduce the body's immunity to infection. 
This is why, over the centuries, poor living conditions, malnutrition, and diabetes always accompanied TB outbreaks. 
During the past twenty years, the spread of HIV has dwarfed these historical accomplices in fuelling TB infection to an alarming rate worldwide: 8.7 million new cases per year and 2 million deaths. 
The vast majority of TB deaths occur in the developing world--largely induced by HIV. 
Indeed, more than 25% of preventable deaths in developing countries are due to TB. 
Because the young and economically productive age groups are the hardest hit, the disease's overall impact is even more destructive--condemning poor countries to generations of grinding despair. 
Unlike HIV, there is a vaccine against TB (although not very effective), and several drugs that can reliably cure the disease after it emerges. 
The key element in any comprehensive eradication effort is rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious cases. 
Diagnosis is cheap, simple, and quick: for a few US cents, microscopic examination of a sputum smear can reveal the bacilli in less than 1 hour. 
Treatment consists of a cocktail of antibiotics (four drugs for two months, followed by two drugs for four months) that, if correctly applied, can cure over 95% of TB cases for about $30 per case. 
The problem is that treatment is too often abandoned at the first signs of clinical improvement - usually after 2-3 months. 
Members of high-risk groups, such as immigrants, the homeless, commercial sex workers, and the poor, are forced to move or search for work. 
In such cases, newly selected drug-resistant bacilli may appear, leaving only second-line drugs that are more toxic and expensive. 
The more these second-line drugs are used, the faster drug-resistant strains emerge and spread - a huge problem in former Soviet countries, where up to 10% of newly diagnosed cases are multi-drug resistant. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a broader strategy - called DOTS - that calls for government commitment to TB control, including adequate diagnostic testing, continuous drug supply, and a proper system for recording, reporting, and assessing results. 
Moreover, the DOTS strategy requires that health care professionals supervise the standard treatment regimens to ensure that TB patients remain on the antibiotic cocktail for the full six months, thereby slowing the emergence of drug resistance. 
Only 148 out of 211 countries (45% of the world's population), however, are currently implementing it. 
The WHO estimates that 80% of all TB cases are concentrated in 23 countries, all poor and most in Africa, Asia, and the former Soviet Union - precisely where HIV infection is spreading most rapidly. 
Opportunities for prevention of both diseases must be exploited simultaneously, requiring close co-operation between TB and AIDS control programs. 
For example, wider use of anti-retroviral treatment in HIV cases can restore immunity and allow TB treatment to act effectively. 
But this is possible only if sufficient technical and financial assistance is channeled to poor countries unable to afford anti-retroviral drugs. 
Developed countries have a clear interest here. 
Western Europe thought it defeated TB in the late 1970s, and dismantled its network of dispensaries. 
In the early 1990s, following a TB resurgence in the US, most West European countries realized that the decline in diagnosed cases had stopped or even reversed, and that they faced new problems owing to increased immigration, HIV infection, and imported multidrug-resistance. 
Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB revived public concern. 
New control strategies were developed, and surveillance systems were implemented to measure their effectiveness. 
But the quality of TB control is still low in much of the world, and TB is a global disease. 
We cannot control it in one country if there is an outbreak next door. 
More than 50% of TB cases in many developed countries - Denmark, Israel, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland - are foreign-born. 
These patients often forgo treatment, and communication with them is difficult. 
There is thus an urgent need for accessible, culturally sensitive health services that are able to involve community leaders in case management from the first contact to the final cure. 
International technical and financial cooperation will ensure that TB expertise is maintained even in countries facing a decline in the number of cases. 
But donor countries and beneficiaries must first define targets, financial shortfalls, and technical requirements to improve TB control on a global scale. 
That must mean sharing HIV's more notorious spotlight. 
The Shape of America’s Recession 
NEW YORK – Now that it is clear that the United States is in recession, the debate has moved on to whether it will be short and shallow or long and deep – a question that is as important for the rest of the world as it is for the US. 
The answer depends on the shape of the US recession: if it is short and shallow, sufficient growth elsewhere will ensure only a slight global slowdown. 
But if the US recession is long and severe, the result could be outright recession in some countries (the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Japan), and even financial crises in vulnerable emerging-market economies. 
In principle, the US recession could end up being shaped like a V, U, W, or L. Which of these four scenarios is most likely? 
The current consensus is that the recession will be V-shaped – short and shallow – and thus similar to the US recessions in 1990-91 and 2001, which lasted eight months each. 
Most analysts forecast that GDP will contract in the first half of 2008 and recover in the second half of the year. 
I expect a longer and deeper U-shaped recession, lasting at least 12 months and possibly as long as 18 months – one of the most severe US recessions in decades – because today’s macroeconomic and financial conditions are far worse. 
First, the US is experiencing its worst housing recession since the Great Depression, and the slump is not over. 
Construction of new homes has fallen about 50%, while new home sales are down more than 60%, creating a supply glut that is driving prices down sharply – 10% so far and probably another 10% this year and in 2009. 
Already, $2.2 trillion of wealth has been wiped out, and about eight million households have negative equity: their homes’ are worth less than their mortgages. 
By 2010, the fall in home prices will be close to 30% with $6.6 trillion of home equity destroyed and 21 million households – 40% of the 51 million with a mortgage – facing negative equity. 
If owners walk away from their homes, credit losses could be $1 trillion or more, wiping out most of the US financial system’s capital and leading to a systemic banking crisis. 
Second, in 2001, weak capital spending in the corporate sector (accounting for 10% of GDP) underpinned the contraction. 
Today, it is private consumption in the household sector (70% of GDP) that is in trouble. 
American consumers are shopped-out, saving-less, debt-burdened (136% of income, on average), and buffeted by many negative shocks. 
Third, the US is experiencing its most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
Losses are spreading from sub-prime to near-prime and prime mortgages, commercial mortgages, and unsecured consumer credit (credit cards, auto loans, student loans). 
Total financial losses – including possibly $1 trillion in mortgages and related securitized products – could be as high as $1.7 trillion. 
Given these staggering sums, the US could face a double-dip, W-shaped recession. 
The main question is whether the tax rebate that US households will receive in mid-2008 will be consumed – thus leading to positive third-quarter growth – or saved. 
Given how financially stretched US households are, a good part of this tax rebate may be used to pay down high credit card balances (or other unsecured consumer credit) or to postpone mortgage delinquency. 
Fortunately, an L-shaped period of protracted economic stagnation – Japan’s experience in the 1990’s – is unlikely. Japan waited almost two years after its asset bubble collapsed to ease monetary policy and provide a fiscal stimulus, whereas in the US both steps came early. 
Moreover, whereas Japan postponed corporate and bank restructuring for years, in the US private and especially public efforts to restructure assets and firms will start faster and be more aggressive. 
Still, given a severe financial crisis, declining home prices, and a credit crunch, the US is facing its longest and deepest recession in decades, dashing any hope of a soft landing for the rest of the world. 
While a global recession will be averted, a severe growth slowdown will not. 
Many European economies are already slowing, with some entering recession. 
China and Asia are particularly vulnerable, given their trade links to the US. 
And emerging markets will suffer once the US contraction and global slowdown undermines commodity prices. 
The Sick Man of Asia 
Japan is sick, but once again people are becoming hopeful that it may at long last recover, mostly because a committed reformer named Heizo Takenaka now seems to be running the economic policy. 
But what policymakers and pundits fail to recognise - or refuse to recognise - is that economic policies per se will not reinvigorate Japan. 
Japan's crisis is systemic, not cyclical. 
Debt, deflation and other maladies are purely symptoms of Japan's disease. 
The causes are a combination of institutional sclerosis, social anomie and gerontocratic governance. 
For several decades after WWII the Japanese system worked remarkably well, not only in generating growth, but in providing high levels of education, long life expectancy, security, and other welfare benefits to its citizens. 
This system rested on three pillars: a cohesive political-industrial establishment, the mobilisation of resources to achieve national economic ends and America's defensive shield. 
Almost immediately after defeat in WWII, Japan metamorphosed from being America's enemy into its pampered protégé. 
This was " real geopolitik " in action. 
The Cold War, the rise of Maoist China, the Korean War all made Japan indispensable to America. 
Not only did the US provide military protection to Japan - allowing Japan to concentrate on industrial goals - but it also provided vast economic assistance, including massive technology transfers and, most important, opening up its market to Japanese exports while allowing Japan to protect its home market. 
Japan developed an "outward looking protectionist" strategy and structure. 
Unlike India or Brazil, which opted for inward-looking protectionism, select sectors of Japanese industry actively participated in international markets. 
Far ranging efforts were deployed to obtain technology transfers. 
The domestic market however was protected by a combination of industrial policy, cartels and a "Buy Japanese" mentality. 
As a "catch-up" strategy, it worked fantastically well. 
By the mid-1980s Japan had more than caught up. 
The September 1985 New York Plaza Hotel meeting of US, European, and Japan's finance ministers - a meeting where the yen was considerably re-valued - symbolized a new era, and should have set in motion new policies in Japan. 
The problem was that alongside its outward-looking protectionist policy, Japan's establishment - the national bureaucracy, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, business, universities, and the media - had fostered a corresponding ideological orthodoxy. 
Instead of evolving as an open, liberal society, Japan had developed a dirigiste closed mercantilist nationalism. 
This was reflected in an aggressive industrial machismo - exports and outward investments reflect virility, in contrast to inward investments and imports - and in various forms of chauvinism, illustrated by the book, The Japan That Can Say `No', (1988) co-authored by the current Governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, and Sony founder Akio Morita. 
By the late 1980s the world was changing fast, but Japan refused to change. 
The country became characterized by immobility and atavism. 
Japanese institutions were archaic and pursued mistaken economic strategies and structures. 
But the illiberal nationalist ideological ethos that defined Japanese society brooked no genuine debate, let alone heterodox positions. 
Indeed, among Japan's most moribund institutions are its universities and media. 
Not only was there no new leadership, but the seniority system and the omnipresence of "senior advisors" continued to prevail throughout Japanese institutions. 
This ossification was driven by the rigid, conservative and gerontocratic nature of governance. 
So even as the Japanese tidal wave appeared poised to overwhelm the world economy in the late 1980s - remember "Japan Inc"? - the country was nearing collapse at home. 
Collapse it did, in 1991. 
But instead of reacting and adjusting, Japan went into denial and wasted a decade (and beyond) spinning its wheels in the sand. 
Policymakers, business leaders, academics and journalists refused to recognize the depth of their country's problems. 
A day of reckoning came with the Kobe earthquake on 17 January 1995. 
As thousands died, the government froze, proving itself incapable of mounting an efficient rescue operation and displaying its ludicrous machismo by refusing the assistance of the US 7 th Fleet. 
It was then that the Japanese people realized that "the emperor" (specifically the government) had no clothes. 
Today's deflation arises from the state of anomie in which Japan was plunged in the mid-1990s and from which it has not recovered. 
The Japanese have no confidence in the future because the establishment has lost all credibility and legitimacy. 
Yet that establishment remains doggedly entrenched in power, its mooted reforms little more than cosmetic: "re-arranging of deck chairs on the Titanic-Maru." 
Strange to say, but the situation may get dramatically worse, not only economically, but also socially. 
The long-suffering Japanese tend to be more patient and disciplined than, say, Argentineans, but when social eruptions have occurred in Japanese history, they have been very violent. 
There is also a strong extremist political minority and a not-too-difficult to tap latent national chauvinism. 
But a different scenario is possible: a reinvigorated, open post-industrial, globally-oriented Japanese society can be established on liberal political foundations. 
Realizing such a scenario will require thorough institutional renewal, rejuvenation of leadership at all levels, a radical change in national "mindset," and the opening up of Japan's economy and society to foreign influences and participation. 
The potential is there; there is a young generation of Japanese who harbour such a vision. 
They need every encouragement, for today's trends are frightening for Japan, for Asia, and for the world. 
The Silence of China's Intellectuals 
Public opinion, as the crisis over the US spy plane demonstrated, now matters in China. 
But where do China’s intellectuals stand and what role do they play? 
In the 1980s traditional Chinese respect for education was revived after the scourge of the Mao years. 
So was the Confucian notion that an intellectual’s highest calling is to tell a ruler what is best for the realm, whether by persuasion or – if you dare – through criticism and taking the consequences. 
In 1979, Liu Binyan's “People or Monsters?” spelled out how communism breeds corruption; in 1988 Su Xiaokang's film “River Elegy” sketched ways in which aspects of the narrow-minded despotism in China's imperial tradition remained alive and well in the Party. 
Both works – and others of the 1980s – mesmerized the public. 
The years since the Tienanmen Massacre seem politically and intellectually anemic by comparison. After 1989 China seemed to lose its moral compass. 
Yet, at a time when an intellectual's conscience might seem most useful – they were inaudible. 
Why? 
Repression is one reason. 
Ironclad taboos prevented public discussion of such subjects as the Cultural Revolution, the Tienanmen Massacre, Falun Gong or other topics perceived as vita the regime’s legitimacy and hold on power. 
Moreover, most of China's leading public intellectuals of the 1980s fled the country after 1989. 
A new generation of intellectual leaders needed time to emerge. 
The collapse of socialist morality and the regime's failure to provide a credible replacement created a "values vacuum" that people sought to fill in various ways. 
Falun Gong boomed, as did Christianity and other religions. Some people embraced nationalism and chauvinism. 
Contemporary intellectuals embraced all these trends. 
In addition, literary intellectuals – who in the 1980s led the way in criticism – fell prey to Western postmodernist jargon, even though such things have little resonance in China. 
State-sponsored repression, however, only partially explains the silence since 1989. 
Urban China's rapid economic growth also shaped intellectual life. 
Many scholars and writers “jumped into the ocean of commerce”(xiahai)to became more comfortable than twenty years ago, when intellectuals lived on tiny salaries and were still emerging from Mao's censure that they were society’s "stinking dregs.” 
Today, intellectuals with marketable skills use them to make more in business than they ever could in academe. 
The social and economic status of better-off intellectuals is second only to Communist officials and the new super-rich. 
Moreover, the freedoms that intellectuals treasure – speech, publication, and travel – expanded greatly. 
New subcultures, and even publications flourish so long as they avoid politically sensitive subjects. 
In short, personal comfort resulted in political timidity and complacency. 
Yet, economic boom generated an ugly gap between rich and poor, and the new political-moral questions that have arisen about this gap show that the Chinese intellectuals' tradition of "worrying about the nation" remains alive. 
How, they ask, can we accept the ways in which newly rich secured their wealth by exploiting power to steal state property? 
Regardless of how wealth was acquired, they wonder if society can accept the grotesque disparities that resulted? 
These questions create an awkward dilemma for intellectuals who favor opening to the West. 
True, the West offers models of democracy, rule of law, a free press, and other means through which injustices can be resolved; but the West also provided the capitalist model that created these injustices. 
So, do you call for more Westernization or less? 
Will membership in the World Trade Organization do more harm or good? 
Is more Western pop culture advisable? 
A diverse, confusing spectrum of muted views has resulted. 
A "new left" embraces the poor, but wants to remain distinct from the authoritarian "old left." 
Liberals have grown their own left and right wings – mainly over the issue of social justice versus political freedom. 
These complexities make it more difficult than before the 1980s for Chinese intellectuals to speak in unison, let alone find their voice. 
The main issues back then – "more reform" and "more opening to the West" – were not freighted with ambiguity and controversy. 
So, the "silence" of Chinese intellectuals has several causes, and is in part illusory. 
Yet, if we ask the Confucian question, "Have intellectuals offered anything that a wise ruler might use?" the answer is yes. In terms of research and careful reasoning, books like He Qinglian's “Modernization's Pitfalls” on the weaknesses of the urban economy and Cao Jinqing's “China by the Yellow River” about poverty and oppression in the countryside – to name two such works – are more substantial than many of the generalities offered in the 1980s. 
Unfortunately, China's leaders, deeply unsure of themselves, are in no mood to accept advice. 
Late last year a publishing ban was imposed on ten leading intellectuals. Several were fired from state-sponsored jobs. 
Happily, because the state no longer has monolithic control, some banned writers found other work, even publishing outlets, on their own. 
Defiance, indeed, is now the exception rather than the rule. 
But the government still is unwilling to listen. 
The Silver Lining in High Commodity Prices 
Cambridge – Today’s soaring commodity prices scream a fundamental truth of modern life that many politicians, particularly in the West, don’t want us to hear: the world’s natural resources are finite, and, as billions of people in Asia and elsewhere escape poverty, Western consumers will have to share them. 
Here is another truth: the price mechanism is a much better way to allocate natural resources than fighting wars, as the Western powers did in the last century. 
The United States’ ill-considered bio-fuels subsidy program demonstrates how not to react. 
Rather than acknowledge that high fuel prices are the best way to inspire energy conservation and innovation, the Bush administration has instituted huge subsidies to American farmers to grow grains for bio-fuel production. 
Never mind that this is hugely inefficient in terms of water and land usage. 
Moreover, even under the most optimistic scenario, the US and the world will still be relying mainly on conventional fossil fuels until the hydrocarbon era comes to an end (which few of us will live to see). 
Last but not least, diverting vast tracts of agricultural land into fuel production has contributed to a doubling of prices for wheat and other grains. 
With food riots in dozens of countries, isn’t it time to admit that the whole idea was a giant, if well-intentioned, mistake? 
Another wrong turn is the proposal recently embraced by two American presidential candidates to temporarily scrap taxes on gasoline. 
As laudable as it may be to help low-income drivers deal with soaring fuel costs, this is not the way to do it. 
The gas tax should be raised , not lowered. 
The sad fact is that by keeping oil prices high, OPEC is doing far more for environmental conservation than Western politicians who seek to prolong the era of ecologically unsustainable Western consumerism. 
Of course, it is not just oil prices that are high, but all commodity prices, from metals to food to lumber. 
Prices for many commodities have doubled over the past couple of years. 
Oil prices have risen almost 400% in the last five years. 
The proximate cause is a global economic boom that has been stronger, longer, and more broad-based than any in modern history. 
Asia has led the way, but the past five years have been the best Latin American and Africa have enjoyed in decades. 
Broad-based commodity shortages often begin to emerge at the end of long global expansions, and in this respect, the present boom is no different. 
Some politicians also complain about speculators who, more and more, are trading commodities on complex and growing markets that allow them to bet on whether, say, future demand from emerging markets is likely to outstrip growth in future supply. 
But why is this a bad thing? 
If “speculators” are bidding up today’s commodity prices because they realize that future generations are going to want commodities, too, isn’t that a healthy development? 
High prices for commodities today mean more supply for future generations, while at the same time creating an incentive to develop new ways to conserve on consumption. 
Again, high prices are helping in ways that Western politicians seem afraid to contemplate. 
Admittedly, the global commodity price boom has had profound, albeit enormously complex and uncertain, effects on poverty. 
While surging commodity prices are helping poor farmers and poor resource-rich countries, they are a catastrophe for the urban poor, some of whom spend 50% or more of their income on food. 
One element of the solution is to compensate the very poor for the higher cost of survival. 
Over the longer term, more money for fertilizer, and other aid to promote self-sufficiency, is also essential. 
The World Bank, the United Nations, and even the Bush administration have moved to help, albeit in small measure relative to the scale of the problem. 
Of course, it should be noted that if economic reform in resource-rich Africa had been proceeding at the same pace as in Asia, the era of soaring commodity prices might have been postponed for another century. 
For now, though, instead of whining about high commodity prices, governments should be shielding only their very poorest citizens, and letting the price spikes serve as a wake-up call for the rest of us. 
The end to Western consumerism is not yet at hand, but high commodity prices are a clear warning that big adjustments will be needed as Asia and other emerging nations begin to consume a larger share of the global pie. 
True, when today’s global economic boom ends, as it inevitably will, commodity prices will plummet, easily 25%, quite possibly 50% or more. 
Western politicians will cheer, and many pundits will express relief that less money will be flowing to undemocratic countries in the developing world. 
But today’s era of high commodity prices is not just a bad dream that should be forgotten when it ends. 
The Sinai Powder Keg 
TEL AVIV– The crisis in the Sinai Peninsula seems to have been dwarfed by Sunday’s drama in Cairo. 
But Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s civilian coup, in which he dismissed General Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the leader of the army’s supreme command, has not diminished the importance of the trouble there. 
Earlier this month, jihadi terrorists ambushed an Egyptian military base in Sinai, killing 16 Egyptian soldiers. 
They then hijacked two armored personnel carriers and sped toward the frontier with Israel. 
One vehicle failed to break through the border crossing; the other penetrated Israeli territory, before being stopped by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). 
In response, Egypt’s military and security forces launched an offensive against Bedouin militants in Sinai, while Morsi forced the General Intelligence Service’s director to retire and dismissed the governor of Northern Sinai. 
These episodes highlight the complexity of the Middle East’s changing geopolitical landscape, the fragility of Egypt’s post-Mubarak political order, and the explosive potential of Sinai, which, though sparsely populated, includes Egypt’s borders with Israel and the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. 
Indeed, since Hosni Mubarak’s ouster last year, security in Sinai has deteriorated, and the region has become fertile ground for Islamic extremism. 
The 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty mandated that Sinai be largely demilitarized in order to serve as a buffer zone between the two former enemies. 
Tourism and natural-gas pipelines linking the two countries provided economic resources for the local Bedouin. 
But, as Mubarak’s regime declined, so did the government’s control over the Bedouin. 
Palestinian militants from Gaza – an active arena of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation since Hamas gained control in 2007 – and jihadi terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda and the larger “global jihad” network penetrated Sinai, exploiting the government’s neglect of the region and inflaming the local population’s feelings of disenfranchisement. 
Israelis complained about Mubarak’s “cold peace,” but they appreciated that he adhered to the treaty’s fundamental provisions. 
Now the behavior of his successors from the military and the Muslim Brotherhood has revived security challenges and raised difficult questions about the region’s future. 
For example, in August 2011, a jihadi group from Gaza seized control of an Egyptian outpost on Israel’s border and killed eight Israeli civilians. 
Their objective was to damage further the Israeli-Egyptian relationship, which is already more fragile than ever, and they succeeded: the IDF accidentally killed several Egyptian soldiers during the incident. 
The Egyptian security forces’ subsequent failure to prevent demonstrators from storming Israel’s embassy in Cairo brought matters to the brink of calamity. 
The uncertainty and disorder that have plagued Egypt for the last 18 months are fueling increasing lawlessness in Sinai. 
Last month, a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed – the 15th such attack since Mubarak’s regime was toppled – and remains out of commission. 
There are four principal actors in this arena: Israel, Egypt, Hamas, and the Sinai jihadis. 
Israel wants, first and foremost, peace and stability. 
To this end, Israeli leaders expect Egypt’s government to reestablish its authority in Sinai, and, despite the peace treaty’s provisions, have agreed to Egyptian requests to increase its military presence in the region. 
Moreover, Israel has practically abandoned any hope of receiving agreed gas supplies from Egypt, and has not pressed its demand that Egypt block the passage of sophisticated weapons to Gaza. 
Israel is determined not to act against terrorist groups and infrastructure on Egypt’s territory. 
And, in view of Hamas’s close links with Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, whose political party backed Morsi’s successful presidential run, Israel has restrained its response to terrorist and rocket attacks from Gaza. 
But Egypt’s divided government has not established a correspondingly coherent policy. 
Relations with Israel are managed by the defense minister, now Lieutenant General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, and the military security establishment, whose leaders are determined to maintain a peaceful relationship with Israel and to secure Egyptian sovereignty in the Sinai. 
For them, the lawless Bedouin, the Sinai jihadis, and Hamas and other groups in Gaza threaten Egypt’s national security. 
But their will and ability to translate this view into policy are limited. 
Meanwhile, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are playing a double game. 
While Morsi denounced the recent violence (particularly the deliberate killing of Egyptian policemen) and issued an implicit threat against Hamas, the Brotherhood published a statement accusing Israel’s Mossad of perpetrating the attack – a claim that Hamas’s Prime Minister of Gaza, Ismael Haniyeh, has repeated. 
In fact, Hamas, too, is playing a double game. 
Having lost Syrian backing, it is hoping that the Egyptian Brothers will provide its kindred movement with political and logistical support. 
Yet it allows radical Palestinians and jihadi groups in Gaza to conduct operations in Sinai. 
The fourth actor, the Sinai jihadis, comprises primarily Bedouins, whose distinct origins and long-time marginalization have led some to identify with radical Islamist groups (often while working in the Arabian Peninsula). 
While this group’s primary goal is to undermine Israel-Egypt relations, they do not shy away from operating directly against the Egyptian state. 
Given their strategic location, Sinai jihadis could easily be used by larger terrorist networks to target strategically vital locations, such as the Suez Canal. 
Egypt’s government was humiliated and incensed by the recent terrorist provocation. 
But it is too early to tell whether its security crackdown in Sinai is a one-time operation, intended to placate angry citizens, or the beginning of a serious effort to address the interconnected problems in Sinai and Gaza. 
It is also too early to tell whether Morsi’s shakeup in Cairo was related to, or expedited by, the Sinai events. 
But Sinai’s explosive potential clearly has been increased by the Muslim Brotherhood’s takeover. 
Israel’s longstanding channel of communication with Egypt through the military has disappeared, and may or may not be replaced by a similar channel. 
Hamas and the Bedouins in Sinai have most likely been emboldened by the latest developments in Cairo. 
But, as Egypt’s domestic politics take their course, Israel, which has had to tread softly in its relationship with Egypt and in Sinai since January 2011, will have to behave with even greater sensitivity in the days ahead. 
The Single Mother Makeover 
NEW YORK – In the 1992 United States presidential election, George H. W. Bush’s campaign made a political splash by going after the television show Murphy Brown – one of the first times, but far from the last, that a fictitious character was introduced to score political points in America. 
Murphy Brown, played by actress Candice Bergen, was a TV anomaly at that time: a sympathetically portrayed single mother. 
So Bush’s vice president, Dan Quayle, attacked the show for normalizing rather than stigmatizing single motherhood. 
Much hand-wringing followed, with single mothers (never, at that time, single fathers) cast as harbingers of doom for core American values. 
The implication was that selfish me-first feminists (if they were affluent white women) or feckless social parasites (if they were low-income women of color) were putting their own interests above their children’s. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s widely reprinted study The Negro Family: The Case for National Action painted a picture of single motherhood as the primary instigator of inner-city and especially African-American criminality, illiteracy, and drug use. 
How times have changed. 
Just as single mothers were irrationally castigated then, so today an equally irrational hagiography has risen around them. (Europe has more single mothers than the US, but, characteristically, has less need to moralize about them one way or the other). 
In US pop culture, the single mother has evolved from selfish yuppie or drug-dazed slut into a woman who is more fun, slightly more heroic, and certainly less frumpy than her married counterpart. 
Indeed, single mothers are the new maternal ideal – women whose maternal drive is so selfless and intense that they choose to raise children even under the burden of their solitary status. 
Angelina Jolie’s photo spread with her toddler son, adopted from Cambodia, in Vanity Fair heralded this shift: the sexy young woman and her son in a luxurious hotel bedroom made single motherhood look fun and glamorous. 
Suddenly Hollywood stars and starlets who were otherwise unattached began to sprout little offspring: Calista Flockhart, who played TV’s ultimate desperate childless single woman, adopted a son – and, like a fairy tale, later met and married Harrison Ford. 
Kourtney Kardashian of the reality show The Kardashians had a baby as an “unwed mother” – a stigmatizing term that has gone out of fashion – and is depicted as bravely holding down the fort and staying up all night with feedings as the child’s irresponsible father parties. 
The tale of Sarah Palin’s daughter, Bristol, has also been spun as a tale of an admirable single mother and a loser father. When they split up, the story line cast the heroic young mother against what was often depicted as the beer-drinking, immature dad. 
Even Jennifer Aniston, whom Brad Pitt left because she did not want kids, now sighs in interviews, as she nears 42, that she has stopped waiting for Prince Charming, and that she, too, could be ready to adopt and go it alone. 
Likewise, advertisements for convenience food and insurance – which used to feature only intact nuclear families – have begun to showcase single mothers lovingly spooning out meatballs, or protectively buying a life-insurance policy. 
The glorification of single mothers represents a collective exasperation on the part of women in America – and women who make decisions in the mainstream media. 
The 1990’s produced a demeaning narrative of women waiting in frustration as their “biological clocks” ticked, cursing themselves for putting career first at the expense of finding Mr. Right and having children. 
In a post-sexual revolution world of marriage-shy men, women would supposedly do anything to secure the blessings of a wedded father for their children. 
The message from the media was one of constant nagging and blame, such as the famous Newsweek cover that asserted (wrongly) that an older single woman had more likelihood of being in a terrorist attack than of finding a husband. 
The whole narrative, as the writer Susan Faludi correctly perceived, was not about marriage at all; it reflected a backlash against feminism. 
At some point, women became powerful enough that they collectively rejected the high social value this narrative placed on a male offer of a ring and flipped the stereotype on its head. 
It started to occur to women that they could be employed and have a family – and that it could even be pretty nice. 
Glamorizing single motherhood is not realistic, but it allows female pop culture to express a revenge fantasy at all the potential husbands and fathers who walked away, or who were not the dream husband and father after all, or who wanted the sex but not the kids and the tuition bills. 
When Bill O’Reilly of Fox News recently accused Aniston of making a movie about single motherhood – The Switch – that seems to say “to a twelve or thirteen year old girl, ‘You don’t need a man,’” he is right. 
These images do appeal to overworked, exasperated, baby-hungry women who may have spent years waiting for “the offer,” telling them that, in fact, you don’t need a man. 
This trend hardly signifies the end of civilization as we know it; all things being equal, most women would still prefer the simple fantasy of a supportive partner in childrearing. 
But the new image of single mothers – and of single motherhood – does show that it is getting harder – if not almost impossible – to coerce women by trying to fix upon them the scarlet letter. 
The Sino-Indian Water Divide 
NEW DELHI – As China and India gain economic heft, they are drawing ever more international attention at the time of an ongoing global shift of power to Asia. 
Their underlying strategic dissonance and rivalry, however, usually attracts less notice. 
As its power grows, China seems determined to choke off Asian competitors, a tendency reflected in its hardening stance toward India. 
This includes aggressive patrolling of the disputed Himalayan frontier by the People’s Liberation Army, many violations of the line of control separating the two giants, new assertiveness concerning India’s northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state – which China claims as its own – and vituperative attacks on India in the state-controlled Chinese media. 
The issues that divide India and China, however, extend beyond territorial disputes. 
Water is becoming a key security issue in Sino-Indian relations and a potential source of enduring discord. 
China and India already are water-stressed economies. 
The spread of irrigated farming and water-intensive industries, together with the demands of a rising middle class, have led to a severe struggle for more water. 
Indeed, both countries have entered an era of perennial water scarcity, which before long is likely to equal, in terms of per capita availability, the water shortages found in the Middle East. 
Rapid economic growth could slow in the face of acute scarcity if demand for water continues to grow at its current frantic pace, turning China and India – both food-exporting countries – into major importers, a development that would accentuate the global food crisis. 
Even though India has more arable land than China – 160.5 million hectares compared to 137.1 million hectares – Tibet is the source of most major Indian rivers. 
The Tibetan plateau’s vast glaciers, huge underground springs and high altitude make Tibet the world’s largest freshwater repository after the polar icecaps. 
Indeed, all of Asia’s major rivers, except the Ganges, originate in the Tibetan plateau. 
Even the Ganges’ two main tributaries flow in from Tibet. 
But China is now pursuing major inter-basin and inter-river water transfer projects on the Tibetan plateau, which threatens to diminish international-river flows into India and other co-riparian states. 
Before such hydro-engineering projects sow the seeds of water conflict, China ought to build institutionalized, cooperative river-basin arrangements with downstream states. 
Upstream dams, barrages, canals, and irrigation systems can help fashion water into a political weapon that can be wielded overtly in a war, or subtly in peacetime to signal dissatisfaction with a co-riparian state. 
Even denial of hydrological data in a critically important season can amount to the use of water as a political tool. 
Flash floods in recent years in two Indian frontier states – Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh – served as an ugly reminder of China’s lack of information-sharing on its upstream projects. 
Such leverage could in turn prompt a downstream state to build up its military capacity to help counterbalance this disadvantage. 
In fact, China has been damming most international rivers flowing out of Tibet, whose fragile ecosystem is already threatened by global warming. 
The only rivers on which no hydro-engineering works have been undertaken so far are the Indus, whose basin falls mostly in India and Pakistan, and the Salween, which flows into Burma and Thailand. 
Local authorities in Yunnan province, however, are considering damming the Salween in the quake-prone upstream region. 
India’s government has been pressing China for transparency, greater hydrological data-sharing, and a commitment not to redirect the natural flow of any river or diminish cross-border water flows. 
But even a joint expert-level mechanism – set up in 2007 merely for “interaction and cooperation” on hydrological data – has proven of little value. 
The most dangerous idea China is contemplating is the northward rerouting of the Brahmaputra river, known as Yarlung Tsangpo to Tibetans, but which China has renamed Yaluzangbu. It is the world’s highest river, and also one of the fastest-flowing. 
Diversion of the Brahmaputra’s water to the parched Yellow river is an idea that China does not discuss in public, because the project implies environmental devastation of India’s northeastern plains and eastern Bangladesh, and would thus be akin to a declaration of water war on India and Bangladesh. 
Nevertheless, an officially blessed book published in 2005, Tibet’s Waters Will Save China , openly championed the northward rerouting of the Brahmaputra. 
Moreover, the Chinese desire to divert the Brahmaputra by employing “peaceful nuclear explosions” to build an underground tunnel through the Himalayas found expression in the international negotiations in Geneva in the mid-1990s on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). 
China sought unsuccessfully to exempt PNEs from the CTBT, a pact still not in force. 
The issue now is not whether China will reroute the Brahmaputra, but when. 
Once authorities complete their feasibility studies and the diversion scheme begins, the project will be presented as a fait accompli . 
China already has identified the bend where the Brahmaputra forms the world’s longest and deepest canyon – just before entering India – as the diversion point. 
China’s ambitions to channel Tibetan waters northward have been whetted by two factors: the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, which, despite the project’s glaring environmental pitfalls, China trumpets as the greatest engineering feat since the construction of the Great Wall; and the power of President Hu Jintao, whose background fuses two key elements – water and Tibet. 
Hu, a hydrologist by training, owes his swift rise in the Communist Party hierarchy to the brutal martial-law crackdown he carried out in Tibet in 1989. 
China’s hydro-engineering projects and plans are a reminder that Tibet is at the heart of the India-China divide. 
Tibet ceased to be a political buffer when China annexed it nearly six decades ago. 
But Tibet can still become a political bridge between China and India. 
For that to happen, water has to become a source of cooperation, not conflict. 
Nationalism, Madness, and Terrorism 
BOSTON – If we want to understand what drove the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to terrorism, the answer almost certainly does not lie in Dagestan, where the brothers lived before moving to the United States, or in the two wars fought in Chechnya in the last 20 years. Instead, a key to the Tsarnaevs’ behavior may perhaps be found in developments in England 500 years ago. 
Several new phenomena appeared in sixteenth-century England that revolutionized human experience. 
English society was redefined as a “nation” – that is, a sovereign community of equal members. 
With that, the era of nationalism began, and social mobility became legitimate. 
At the same time, a special variety of mental illness was first observed, which we would later call schizophrenia and depressive disorders – different from a multitude of mental illnesses already known. 
It called into being a new term, “madness,” the first medical specialization (eventually named “psychiatry”), and special legislation regarding the “mad.” 
Madness expressed itself in degrees of mental impairment, the common symptoms of which were chronic discomfort in one’s environment (social maladjustment), uncertainty about oneself, oscillation between self-loathing and megalomania, and sometimes a complete loss of identity. 
Suicide became common, and the nature of violent crime changed, with a new type – irrational and unconnected to self-interest – becoming increasingly prevalent. 
These phenomena were connected. 
It was nationalism that legitimated mobility; the two of them together that produced madness; and the new mental disease that expressed itself in suicide and irrational violence. 
Nationalism implied a specific image of society and reality in general – a consciousness that was to become the cultural framework of modernity. 
In its original, English, form it was essentially democratic. 
As it spread, it carried the seeds of democracy everywhere. 
By considering a living community sovereign, nationalism implicitly but drastically reduced the relevance of God; even when combined with religion and presented in a religious idiom, it was essentially secular. 
National consciousness, dramatically different from the fundamentally religious, hierarchical consciousness that it replaced, shapes how we live today. 
Nationalist principles emphasize the self-governing individual, including the right to choose one’s social position and identity. 
But this liberty, empowering and encouraging the individual to choose what to be, complicates identity formation. 
A member of a nation cannot learn who or what s/he is from the environment, as would an individual in a religious and rigidly stratified social order, in which everyone’s position and behavior is defined by birth and divine providence. 
Modern culture cannot provide us with the consistent guidance that other cultures give to their members. 
By providing inconsistent guidance (for we are inevitably guided by our cultural environment), nationalism actively disorients us – a cultural insufficiency called anomie. 
Because a clear sense of identity is a necessary condition for adequate mental functioning, malformation of identity leads to discomfort with one’s self and social maladjustment, reaching clinical proportions among the more fragile of us. 
That is why the addition of madness to the roster of familiar mental illnesses coincided with the emergence of nationalism. 
The more choices for the definition of one’s identity that a society offers – and the more insistent it is on equality – the more problematic the formation of identity in it becomes. 
That is why the most open and freest society today, the Unites States, leads the world in rates of severe mental disease – supplanting England, yesterday’s freest and most open society. 
Indeed, foreigners at one time considered madness “the English malady.” 
Most examples of violent crime by mentally ill people were committed first in England, and then in the US, often seeming politically motivated, even when mediated by religion. 
The first such case was likely that of Peter Berchet, a young Protestant, who felt that he had to kill the royal councilor Christopher Hatton, also a Protestant, whom Berchet believed to be a Catholic sympathizer. Attempting to answer this calling, Berchet murdered another Protestant whom he mistook for Hatton. 
To all appearances the act of a Puritan fanatic, the authorities suspected Berchet of being a part of an organized Puritan conspiracy. 
He was to be questioned to divulge the names of his co-conspirators and then executed. 
But it was quickly revealed, instead, that he was suffering from a “nawghtye mallenchollye.” 
It was as natural for an Elizabethan Protestant to see the cause of his mental discomfort in a government overrun by Catholic sympathizers as it is for someone with a Muslim connection in the US today to see this cause in America as the embodiment of Western offenses against the faith. 
Blaming one’s existential discomfort on external factors is a kind of self-therapy. 
A story is constructed, which rationalizes one’s discomfort as reflecting an awareness of some general evil. One may then join an organization committed to fighting that evil or be impelled to act on one’s own – to the point of committing murder. 
The thinking behind such acts bears the most distinctive mark of delusion: the loss of the understanding of the symbolic nature of human reality, confusing symbols and their referents, and seeing people in terms of what they represent. 
It is precisely this modern irrationality – a product of modernity itself – that the terrorist attack launched by the Tsarnaev brothers reflected. 
The Sixty-Year Storm 
Today’s financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, also marks the end of an era of credit expansion based on the dollar as the international reserve currency. 
It is a much bigger storm than any that has occurred since the end of World War II. 
To understand what is happening, we need a new paradigm. 
It is available in the theory of reflexivity, which I first proposed 20 years ago in my book The Alchemy of Finance . 
The theory holds that financial markets do not tend towards equilibrium. 
Biased views and misconceptions among market participants introduce uncertainty and unpredictability not only into market prices, but also into the fundamentals that those prices are supposed to reflect. 
Left to their own devices, markets are prone to extremes of euphoria and despair. 
Indeed, because of their potential instability, financial markets are not left to their own devices; they are in the charge of authorities whose job it is to keep the excesses within bounds. 
But the authorities are also human and subject to biased views and misconceptions. 
And the interaction between financial markets and financial authorities is also reflexive. 
Boom-bust processes usually revolve around credit, and always involve a bias or misconception – usually a failure to recognize a reflexive, circular connection between the willingness to lend and the value of the collateral. 
The recent US housing boom is a case in point. 
But the 60-year super-boom is a more complicated case. 
Every time the credit expansion ran into trouble, the financial authorities intervened, injecting liquidity and finding other ways to stimulate the economy. 
That created a system of asymmetric incentives – also know as moral hazard – which encouraged ever greater credit expansion. 
The system was so successful that people came to believe in what former president Ronald Reagan called “the magic of the marketplace” and I call market fundamentalism. 
Fundamentalists believe that markets tend towards equilibrium and the common interest is best served by allowing participants to pursue their self-interest. 
This is an obvious misconception, because it was the intervention of the authorities that prevented financial markets from breaking down, not the markets themselves. 
Nevertheless, market fundamentalism emerged as the dominant ideology in the 1980s, when financial markets started to become globalized and the US began running a current account deficit. 
Since 1980, regulations have been progressively relaxed until they practically disappeared. 
Globalization allowed the US to suck up the savings of the rest of the world and consume more than it produced, with its current account deficit reaching 6.2% of GNP in 2006. 
The financial markets encouraged consumers to borrow by introducing ever more sophisticated instruments and more generous terms. 
The authorities aided and abetted the process by intervening whenever the global financial system was at risk. 
The super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves. 
Similarly, the rating agencies relied on information provided by the originators of synthetic products. 
It was a shocking abdication of responsibility. 
Everything that could go wrong did. 
What started with subprime mortgages spread to all collateralized debt obligations, endangered municipal and mortgage insurance and reinsurance companies and threatened to unravel the multi-trillion-dollar credit default swap market. 
Investment banks’ commitments to leveraged buyouts became liabilities. 
Market-neutral hedge funds turned out not to be market-neutral and had to be unwound. 
The asset-backed commercial paper market came to a standstill and the special investment vehicles set up by banks to get mortgages off their balance sheets could no longer get outside financing. 
The final blow came when interbank lending, which is at the heart of the financial system, was disrupted because banks had to husband their resources and could not trust their counterparties. 
Central banks had to inject an unprecedented amount of money and extend credit on an unprecedented range of securities to a broader range of institutions than ever before. 
That made the crisis more severe than any since World War II. 
Credit expansion must now be followed by a period of contraction, because some of the new credit instruments and practices are unsound and unsustainable. 
Moreover, the ability of the financial authorities to stimulate the economy is constrained by the unwillingness of the rest of the world to accumulate additional dollar reserves. 
Until recently, investors hoped that the US Federal Reserve would do whatever it takes to avoid a recession, because that is what it did on previous occasions. 
Now, they must recognize that the Fed may no longer be in a position to do so. 
With oil, food and other commodities firm, and the renminbi appreciating somewhat faster, the Fed also has to worry about inflation. 
If interest rates were lowered beyond a certain point, the dollar would come under renewed pressure and long-term bonds would actually go up in yield. 
It is impossible to determine where that point is, but when it is reached, the Fed’s ability to stimulate the economy comes to an end. 
Although a recession in the developed world is now more or less inevitable, China, India, and some of the oil-producing countries are in a very strong countertrend. 
As a result, the current financial crisis is less likely to cause a global recession than a radical realignment of the global economy, with a relative decline of the US and the rise of China and other developing countries. 
The danger is that the resulting political tensions, including US protectionism, may disrupt the global economy and plunge the world into recession – or worse. 
The Skills Deficit 
BRUSSELS – Two years after the world economy suffered a nervous breakdown in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, global financial markets remain unsettled, and the recovery that started so vigorously in 2009 seems to be stalling. 
The slowdown has predictably led to calls for further fiscal and monetary stimulus. 
The argument seems simple: only a massive dose of government spending and massive central-bank support for the financial system prevented a slide into a second Great Depression, so more of the same medicine is now needed to prevent a slide back into recession. 
This argument seems particularly strong in the United States, which during the long boom years grew accustomed to unemployment rates of around 5% and steady growth in consumption. 
But, in assessing the outlook for the US economy, one should not compare low quarterly growth rates (the data for April-June are particularly disappointing) and the current unemployment rate of almost 10% to the “goldilocks” bubble period. 
A longer-term view is required, because the US is facing a structural-adjustment challenge that will be accompanied by high unemployment. 
Like Southern Europe, the US economy must move away from the consumption/housing-led growth model of the last decade. 
President Barack Obama has encapsulated this challenge by setting the goal of doubling US exports over the next decade. 
But this is easier said than done. 
The structural shift towards exports will be difficult and time-consuming mainly because producing the high-tech goods that the US should be exporting requires a skilled workforce, which has largely been lost and cannot be re-created overnight. 
During the ten years preceding the peak of the bubble in 2007, about four million jobs were lost in the US manufacturing sector, whose share in total employment fell from more than 17% to 12%. 
Unemployment remained low because the booming domestic economy created enough jobs in services and construction. 
Reversing this shift quickly seems impossible. 
Most construction workers are rather low-skilled and thus cannot be re-deployed to modern high-tech manufacturing. 
The same applies to real-estate agents, social workers, and managers of credit-card accounts. 
During the bubble years, the situation was exactly the opposite: most of the workers released by a rapidly shrinking manufacturing sector could be employed easily in construction and social services, which require only low skills (likewise, real-estate services demand only rather general skills). 
The key point is not that manufacturing jobs are somehow better, but rather that we must consider the asymmetry in the structural-adjustment process. 
It is relatively easy to manage a structural shift out of manufacturing during a real-estate boom, but it is much more difficult to re-establish a competitive manufacturing sector once it has been lost. 
Post-bubble economies thus face a fundamental mismatch between the skills available in the existing work force and the requirements of a modern export-oriented manufacturing sector. 
Unfortunately, there is very little that economic policy can do to create a strong exporting sector in the short run, except alleviate the social pain. 
Labor-market flexibility is always touted as a panacea, but even the highest degree of it cannot transform unemployed realtors or construction workers into skilled manufacturing specialists. 
Experience has also shown that retraining programs have only limited success. 
Ironically, Germany might provide the most useful template for the problems facing US policymakers. 
Germany experienced a consumption and construction boom after unification, with full employment and a current-account deficit. 
After the boom peaked in 1995, one million construction workers were laid off and could not find jobs elsewhere. 
The German economy faced a decade of high unemployment and slow growth. 
Exports initially did not constitute a path to recovery because the deutsche mark was overvalued, and some manufacturing capacity had been lost during the unification boom. “International competitiveness” became the mantra of German economic policymaking. 
But it still took more than ten years for Germany to become the export powerhouse of today. 
It is unlikely that the adjustment process will be much faster in the US, where the manufacturing base has shrunk much more sharply. 
Moreover, with the introduction of the euro, Germany had the advantage of pegging its currency to Southern Europe, which was experiencing a housing boom even more extreme than in the US, thus providing German exporters with growing markets and little competition. 
By contrast, the US dollar is tied to the renminbi, whose issuer – China – has the world’s largest and fastest-growing export sector. 
How long will the US adjustment take? 
Since the peak of the bubble, the US economy has not even been moving in the right direction. 
The contraction in manufacturing output and employment has actually accelerated – and faster than output and employment have fallen in the sectors on which the economy remains dependent for much of its growth: domestic services, such as health care, and finance, insurance, and real-estate services (the sector responsible for the crisis). 
So long as this trend continues, only high and continuing doses of fiscal and monetary expansion will be able to sustain domestic demand. 
And, given that many goods are no longer produced in the US, stimulus measures would suck in more imports, further undermining the trade balance. 
A self-sustaining recovery is, of course, possible, but it presupposes a massive structural adjustment aimed at restoring US competitiveness in global markets. 
The Sleeping Volcano of Global Finance 
The rejection of the European Union’s Constitutional Treaty by French and Dutch voters was, according to all evidence, more a rejection of unregulated globalization than it was a rejection of Europe. 
The general instability of social relations – most importantly, but not only, of employment – is slowly becoming intolerable for a growing part of the population in many developed countries, not just in Europe. 
And there cannot be a stable economic order – at least not in democratic countries – if electorates reject its underpinnings. 
Capitalism could be reconstructed after World War II because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation: social security, which served as a principal stabilizer, at least in the developed countries; 
Keynesian tools to fight domestic cyclical downturns; and a universal high-wage policy aimed at stimulating general consumption, without which the genius of capitalism – mass production – does not work. 
But the realignment of the rich, developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists like Milton Friedman, which began around 1970, broke with all that. 
Not long after, the dollar was detached from the gold standard. 
Ever since, the international financial system has endured almost constant instability. 
Crises have multiplied, with each seemingly worse than the one that came before. 
Throughout the rich world, poverty has come roaring back. 
Internal and international inequalities have been increasing at breakneck speed. 
Employment is increasingly precariousness. And where unemployment is preferred to universal job insecurity, it has become impossible to suppress. 
It is to this state of affairs that the French and Dutch said “no” two months ago. 
Paradoxically, however, a united Europe is likely to be needed even more in the near future than it was in the past. After all, beyond the social misery produced by the re-institutionalized cruelty of the current global economic system, the greatest danger facing the world nowadays is that very system’s inherent instability. 
I don’t see any institution other than the EU that has enough size and heft to protect Europeans from a possible implosion. 
Consider the simple fact that the American economy is now more than $600 billion in debt. 
The United States cannot function without being able to borrow $1.9 billion dollars each and every day of the year, mainly from the emerging economies of Asia, and China above all. 
But this support could weaken or even cease if the dollar falls too low, if the price of oil rises too high, or if the American economy backfires. 
In fact, the US economy has become increasingly detached from reality. 
Its manufacturing sector now accounts for a mere 11% of America’s GDP. 
Ford and General Motors are in dire financial straits. 
Meanwhile, two speculative bubbles – in the real estate market and in mortgages – have become grafted upon each other and now dominate economic activity in the US. 
A crash, or at least a sharp spasm, is quite likely in the near future, and the consequences – for America and the world – may be catastrophic. 
This instability also makes it difficult to address other grave problems affecting the global financial system. 
Sovereign debt, needed by all countries, but particularly by the poorest, suffers profoundly from erratic interest-rate and exchange-rate movements. 
The absence of a lender of last resort in today’s world only magnifies the threat involved in each crisis. 
To make matters worse, national failures can no longer be addressed without aggravating the situation. 
Of course – indeed, above all – in such circumstances the immense investments needed to overcome underdevelopment and the disabilities that it entails are increasingly forgotten by the world of international finance. 
With rich countries threatened by instability and poor countries largely left to their own devices, the reconstruction of the world financial system should be at the top of the international agenda. 
A new Bretton Woods could not be more urgent! 
Five Years in Limbo 
NEW YORK – When the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, triggering the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression, a broad consensus about what caused the crisis seemed to emerge. A bloated and dysfunctional financial system had misallocated capital and, rather than managing risk, had actually created it. 
Financial deregulation – together with easy money – had contributed to excessive risk-taking. 
Monetary policy would be relatively ineffective in reviving the economy, even if still-easier money might prevent the financial system’s total collapse. 
Thus, greater reliance on fiscal policy – increased government spending – would be necessary. 
Five years later, while some are congratulating themselves on avoiding another depression, no one in Europe or the United States can claim that prosperity has returned. 
The European Union is just emerging from a double-dip (and in some countries a triple-dip) recession, and some member states are in depression. 
In many EU countries, GDP remains lower, or insignificantly above, pre-recession levels. 
Almost 27 million Europeans are unemployed. 
Similarly, 22 million Americans who would like a full-time job cannot find one. 
Labor-force participation in the US has fallen to levels not seen since women began entering the labor market in large numbers. 
Most Americans’ income and wealth are below their levels long before the crisis. 
Indeed, a typical full-time male worker’s income is lower than it has been in more than four decades. 
Yes, we have done some things to improve financial markets. 
There have been some increases in capital requirements – but far short of what is needed. 
Some of the risky derivatives – the financial weapons of mass destruction – have been put on exchanges, increasing their transparency and reducing systemic risk; but large volumes continue to be traded in murky over-the-counter markets, which means that we have little knowledge about some of our largest financial institutions’ risk exposure. 
Likewise, some of the predatory and discriminatory lending and abusive credit-card practices have been curbed; but equally exploitive practices continue. 
The working poor still are too often exploited by usurious payday loans. 
Market-dominant banks still extract hefty fees on debit- and credit-card transactions from merchants, who are forced to pay a multiple of what a truly competitive market would bear. 
These are, quite simply, taxes, with the revenues enriching private coffers rather than serving public purposes. 
Other problems have gone unaddressed – and some have worsened. 
America’s mortgage market remains on life-support: the government now underwrites more than 90% of all mortgages, and President Barack Obama’s administration has not even proposed a new system that would ensure responsible lending at competitive terms. 
The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable. 
Despite scandal after scandal, from money laundering and market manipulation to racial discrimination in lending and illegal foreclosures, no senior official has been held accountable; when financial penalties have been imposed, they have been far smaller than they should be, lest systemically important institutions be jeopardized. 
The credit ratings agencies have been held accountable in two private suits. 
But here, too, what they have paid is but a fraction of the losses that their actions caused. 
More important, the underlying problem – a perverse incentive system whereby they are paid by the firms that they rate – has yet to change. 
Bankers boast of having paid back in full the government bailout funds that they received when the crisis erupted. 
But they never seem to mention that anyone who got huge government loans with near-zero interest rates could have made billions simply by lending that money back to the government. 
Nor do they mention the costs imposed on the rest of the economy – a cumulative output loss in Europe and the US that is well in excess of $5 trillion. 
Meanwhile, those who argued that monetary policy would not suffice turned out to have been right. 
Yes, we were all Keynesians – but all too briefly. 
Fiscal stimulus was replaced by austerity, with predictable – and predicted – adverse effects on economic performance. 
Some in Europe are pleased that the economy may have bottomed out. 
With a return to output growth, the recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction – is officially over. 
But, in any meaningful sense, an economy in which most people’s incomes are below their pre-2008 levels is still in recession. 
And an economy in which 25% of workers (and 50% of young people) are unemployed – as is the case in Greece and Spain – is still in depression. 
Austerity has failed, and there is no prospect of a return to full employment any time soon (not surprisingly, prospects for America, with its milder version of austerity, are better). 
The financial system may be more stable than it was five years ago, but that is a low bar – back then, it was teetering on the edge of a precipice. 
Those in government and the financial sector who congratulate themselves on banks’ return to profitability and mild – though hard-won – regulatory improvements should focus on what still needs to be done. 
The glass is, at most, only one-quarter full; for most people, it is three-quarters empty. 
The Smartest Ways to Save the World 
COPENHAGEN – If you had $75 billion to spend over the next four years and your goal was to advance human welfare, especially in the developing world, how could you get the most value for your money? 
That is the question that I posed to a panel of five top economists, including four Nobel laureates, in the Copenhagen Consensus 2012 project. 
The panel members were chosen for their expertise in prioritization and their ability to use economic principles to compare policy choices. 
Over the past year, more than 50 economists prepared research on nearly 40 investment proposals in areas ranging from armed conflicts and natural disasters to hunger, education, and global warming. 
The teams that drafted each paper identified the costs and benefits of the smartest ways to spend money within their area. 
In early May, many of them traveled to Denmark to convince the expert panel of the power of their investment proposals. 
The panel’s findings reveal that, if spent smartly, $75 billion – just a 15% increase in current aid spending – could go a long way to solving many of the world’s challenges. 
The single most important investment, according to the panel, would step up the fight against malnutrition. 
New research for the project by John Hoddinott of the International Food Policy Research Institute and Peter Orazem of Iowa State University focuses on an investment of $3 billion annually. 
This would purchase a bundle of interventions, including micronutrient provision, complementary foods, treatment for worms and diarrheal diseases, and behavior-change programs, all of which could reduce chronic under-nutrition by 36% in developing countries. 
In total, such an investment would help more than 100 million children to start their lives without stunted growth or malnourishment. 
And comprehensive research now shows that such interventions would stay with them for life: their bodies and muscles would grow faster, their cognitive abilities would improve, and they would pay more attention in school (and stay there longer). 
Studies show that, decades down the line, these children would be more productive, make more money, have fewer kids, and begin a virtuous circle of dramatic development. 
Such opportunities come sharply into focus when you ask some of the world’s best minds to find the biggest bang for the buck. 
Micronutrient provision is rarely celebrated, but it makes a world of difference. 
Likewise, just $300 million would prevent 300,000 child deaths if it were used to strengthen the Global Fund’s Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria financing mechanism, which makes combination therapies cheaper for poor countries. 
Put in economic terms, the benefits are 35 times higher than the costs – even without taking into account that it safeguards our most effective malaria drug from future drug resistance. 
Later this year, donors will decide whether to renew this facility. 
The panel’s findings should help to persuade them to do so. 
For a similar amount, 300 million children could be dewormed in schools. 
By not sharing their food with intestinal parasites, they, too, would become more alert, stay longer in school, and grow up to be more productive adults – another cause that needs much more public attention. 
Expanding tuberculosis treatment and childhood immunization coverage are two other health investments that the expert panel endorses. 
Likewise, a $100 million annual increase in spending to develop a vaccine against HIV/AIDS would generate substantial benefits in the future. 
As people in the developing world live longer, they are increasingly experiencing chronic disease; indeed, half of all deaths this year will be from chronic diseases in Third World countries. 
Here, the panel finds that spending just $122 million could achieve complete Hepatitis B vaccine coverage and avert about 150,000 annual deaths from the disease. 
Getting low-cost drugs for acute heart attacks to developing countries would cost just $200 million, and prevent 300,000 deaths. 
The expert panel’s findings point to a compelling need to invest roughly $2 billion annually in research and development to increase agricultural output. 
Not only would this reduce hunger by increasing food production and lowering food prices; it would also protect biodiversity, because higher crop productivity would mean less deforestation. 
That, in turn, would help in the fight against climate change, because forests store carbon. 
When it comes to climate change, the experts recommend spending a small amount – roughly $1 billion – to investigate the feasibility of cooling the planet through geo-engineering options. 
This would allow us to understand better the technology’s risks, costs, and benefits. 
Moreover, the research could potentially give us low-cost, effective insurance against global warming. 
Another priority for investment is the establishment of effective early-warning systems for natural disasters in developing countries. 
For less than $1 billion a year, this would alleviate both direct and long-term economic damage, possibly securing some $35 billion in benefits. 
The $75 billion budget chosen for the Copenhagen Consensus project is large enough to make a real difference, but small enough that we must choose – as in the real world – the projects that can achieve the most good. 
The expert panel’s list shows us that there are many smart solutions waiting to be implemented. 
The Social Brain 
Imitation, as the saying goes, is the sincerest form of flattery. 
But it even seems to form the heart of our humanity. 
Indeed, imitation appears to be a vital key to understanding human development, from behavior and language to empathy and social skills. 
Compared with most other species, human beings are so immature at birth that they require an exceptionally long period of nursing and shelter. 
We spend our long infancy and childhood adapting to the widely varying and complex sociocultural environment that surrounds us. 
This allows us to interact and operate successfully within our environment throughout our lives. 
From the outset, even before we develop the ability to use spoken language, nonverbal communication drastically shapes our personality and sense of self. 
Children learn by watching adults and other children, developing important skills under continuous social feedback. 
This feedback enables proper production and, later, understanding, of emotion-related facial expressions that the subject herself cannot see. 
Fortunately for human development, healthy children find imitation enormously gratifying. 
They enjoy both imitating and being imitated. 
Imitation is so essential to mastering basic social skills and transferring cultural knowledge that it is likely to have an organic basis in the brain. 
Mirror neurons, first discovered in monkeys, may serve such a function, providing a common code between the sender and receiver of a nonverbal message. 
A monkey's mirror neurons are activated both when he himself is acting, say, taking a raisin from a tray, and when he is viewing another monkey (or the human experimenter) performing the same act. 
Brain imaging studies have now shown that the human brain contains a similar mirror-neuron system (MNS). 
For example, merely viewing another person's movements activates our own motor cortex, which we normally use for precise control of our actual movements. 
As sports fans, musicians, and students of body language know, watching other people's movements and postures may facilitate the viewer's own motor schemes, sometimes resulting in unintended imitation. 
One can copy movements and motor acts without understanding their meaning. 
This happens when a flock of geese suddenly takes flight from a lake, "blindly" following the flock's first frightened member. 
For humans, the MNS may provide a more sophisticated copying mechanism that helps us to understand the intentions of other people--in a sense, to read their minds. 
Humans compute other people's intentions and emotions continuously, constantly observing their movements, postures, and gaze. 
These mind-reading skills are essential for successful social interaction. 
Researchers have found that a key part of the human MNS is Broca's region, an area of the brain that, when damaged, prevents the patient from speaking. 
Broca's region is the human counterpart of the monkey mirror-neuron area. 
As both human and monkey mirror neurons code hand manipulation and facial gestures, some interesting hypotheses have emerged. 
For example, the presence of mirror neurons in Broca's region suggests that human language co-evolved with hand and facial gestures rather than arising directly from vocalizations. 
In humans, Broca's region is found in the left brain hemisphere, whose dominance for speech is well known. 
But the corresponding area is larger also in the left brain of great apes, further indicating that the Broca's region evolved first for gestural communication and only later for speech. 
Behavioral studies, too, have shown that gesturing is closely related to speech production. 
To take a familiar example, we gesture even while speaking on the telephone, when others cannot see us. 
Indeed, congenitally blind persons gesture--even while speaking with people they know to be blind as well! 
The existence of the human MNS means that the same brain areas may be activated when we perform a motor act and when we merely observe another person perform a similar act. 
This leads to an obvious question: how do we know that we actually performed a motor act rather than only seeing it? 
For most people, physical feedback provided by muscle and tendon sensors helps in resolving this, as does proper communication between brain areas. 
But misattribution of one's own acts does, in fact, occur in some psychiatric disorders. 
Other disorders are associated with defective imitation skills. 
For example, autistic individuals imitate others less and in a different manner than healthy subjects. 
They also have poor mind-reading skills. 
Some patients, by contrast, suffer at the opposite extreme of dysfunction. 
They "echo," imitating almost all movements of other people. 
Perhaps most intriguing, the MNS could provide a platform for mental simulation of future actions--one's own and those of others. 
It might also be part of a larger mechanism that allows intentions, emotions, and even the intensity of pain to be matched by gestures and communicated between individuals. 
New imaging tools enable us to study these and other questions about human brain function more productively than ever before. 
We can now accurately follow in both time and space the brain's processing routes, which are determined not only by genes, but also by all the experience that an individual has gained during her entire lifetime. 
In these studies, neurologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, and behavioral researchers all contribute to realizing their common interest in discovering how the human brain operates. 
Brain imaging, combined with the new conceptual framework implied by research on the mirror-neuron system, promises to uncover a more holistic "social" brain. 
This brain's functions and dysfunctions--its very structure--will broaden dramatically our understanding of the relationship between the self and others. 
The Social Dimensions of Globalization 
The war on terrorism and in Iraq has distracted much of the world's attention from the pressing issue of how globalization should be managed so that it benefits everyone. 
A new report, issued by the International Labor Organization's Commission on the Social Dimensions of Globalization, reminds us how far the Bush administration is out of line with the global consensus. 
The ILO is a tripartite organization with representatives of labor, government, and business. 
The Commission, chaired by the presidents of Finland and Tanzania, has 24 members (of whom I was one) drawn from different nationalities, interests groups, and intellectual persuasions, including members as diverse as the head of Toshiba and the leader of the AFL-CIO. 
Yet this very heterogeneous group was able to crystallize the emerging global consensus that globalization, despite its positive potential, has not only failed to live up to that potential, but has actually contributed to social distress. 
The fault lies with how globalization has been managed - partly by countries, but most importantly, by the international community, including institutions like the World Bank, World Trade Organization, and the IMF, which are responsible for establishing the "rules of the game." 
The Commission even reached consensus on a number of concrete measures to help put a "human face" on globalization - or at least mitigate some of its worst effects. 
The gap between the emerging consensus on globalization, which this report reflects, and the Bush administration's international economic policies help explain today's widespread hostility towards America's government. 
Consider two issues that have been part of recent bilateral trade agreements pushed aggressively by the Bush administration. 
The crises in East Asia and the recent recessions in Latin America show that premature capital market liberalization can result in enormous economic volatility, increasing poverty, and destruction of the middle class. 
Even the IMF now recognizes that capital market liberalization has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries. 
Yet, whether driven by narrow ideology or responding to the demands of special interests, the Bush administration is still demanding an extreme form of such liberalization in its bilateral trade agreements. 
The second issue concerns the unbalanced intellectual property provisions (TRIPs) of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, dictated by America's pharmaceutical and entertainment industries. 
These provisions restricted countries from making generic imitations of drugs, making many critically important medicines unaffordable in developing countries. 
Spearheaded by worries about AIDS, activists around the world demanded that something be done. 
Just before last year's trade talks in Cancun, the US made some concessions, so that it was no longer the only holdout. 
In its bilateral trade agreements, however, the US is demanding what is becoming known as "TRIPs plus," which would strengthen intellectual property rights further, to ensure that countries only have the right to produce inexpensive generic drugs during epidemics and other emergencies. 
The global consensus, reflected in the Commission report, calls for more exceptions, so that, say, drugs can be made available in any case where to do so could save a life. 
To those confronting the prospect of death, what matters is access to life-saving drugs, not whether what is killing the person is part of an epidemic. 
Bilateral agreements form the basis of enhanced ties of friendship between countries. 
But America's intransigence in this area is sparking protests in countries facing the "threat" of such an agreement, such as Morocco, and is forming the basis of long-lasting resentment. 
The Commission highlights other issues that have received insufficient global attention - such as tax competition among developing countries, which shifts more of the tax burden from business to workers. 
In still other areas, the Commission's report argues for more "balanced" perspectives. 
On exchange rates, for example, it is more sympathetic towards mixed systems - in contrast to the traditional belief that countries must choose between the extremes of a completely flexible system and a hard peg (of the kind that contributed so importantly to Argentina's woes). 
As this example shows, bringing different voices to the table in discussions of globalization brings new perspectives. 
Until now, the main worry for most experts on globalization has been excessive government intervention in the economy. 
The Commission fears just the opposite. 
It argues that the state has a role to play in cushioning individuals and society from the impact of rapid economic change. 
The way that globalization has been managed, however, has eroded the ability of the state to play its proper role. 
At the root of this problem is the global political system - if such it can be called. 
Key players like the IMF and World Bank must become more transparent and their voting structures must be changed to reflect the current distribution of economic power - as opposed to that prevailing in 1945 - let alone to reflect basic democratic principles. 
Whatever one thinks of the many concrete suggestions made by the Commission, this much is clear: we need a more inclusive debate about globalization, one in which more voices are heard, and in which there is more focus on the social dimensions of globalization. 
This is a message the world would do well to heed, lest discontent with globalization continue to grow. 
The Soft Power of the United Nations 
Joseph Stalin once dismissed the relevance of “soft power” by asking, “How many troops does the Pope have?” Today, many self-styled realists dismiss the United Nations as powerless, and argue that it can be ignored. 
They are mistaken. 
Power is the ability to affect others to produce the outcomes one wants. 
Hard power works through payments and coercion (carrots and sticks); soft power works through attraction and co-option. 
With no forces of its own and a relatively tiny budget, the UN has only as much hard power as it can borrow from its member states. 
It was created in 1945 to be the servant of its member states, and Article 2.7 of its charter protects the sovereign jurisdiction of its members. 
After the failure of the League of Nations in the 1930’s, the UN was designed to have the Security Council’s permanent members act as policemen to enforce collective security. 
When the great powers agreed, the UN had impressive hard power, as demonstrated in the Korean War and the first Gulf War. 
But such cases were exceptional. 
During the Cold War, the Council was divided. 
As one expert put it, its permanent members’ veto was designed to be like a fuse box in an electrical system: better that the lights go out than that the house burn down. 
Despite those limits, the UN has considerable soft power that arises from its ability to legitimize the actions of states, particularly regarding the use of force. 
People do not live wholly by the word, but neither do they live solely by the sword. 
For example, the UN could not prevent the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but the absence of its imprimatur greatly raised the costs to the American and British governments. 
Some American leaders then tried to de-legitimize the UN and called for an alternative alliance of democracies. 
But they missed the point: Iraq policy had divided allied democracies, and, with its universal membership, the UN remained an important source of legitimacy in the eyes of most of the world. 
The greatest damage to the UN’s legitimacy has been self-inflicted. 
For example, in recent years the internal bloc politics among its member states produced a Human Rights Council with little interest in fair procedures or the advance of human rights. 
Likewise, administrative inefficiency has led to poor performance of high-profile efforts like the oil-for-food program. 
The job of UN Secretary General involves very little hard power, but some people have filled the post with great effect, using their soft power resources to leverage the hard power of governments. 
For example, Dag Hammarskjold seized the opportunity of the Suez Crisis created by Britain and France’s invasion of Egypt in 1956 to persuade governments to create peacekeeping forces – an institution that is not mentioned in the UN original charter. 
In the wake of the UN’s failures to prevent genocide and ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and Kosovo in the 1990’s, Kofi Annan worked with others to persuade governments to recognize a new responsibility to protect endangered peoples. 
But such innovations have their limits. 
In the aftermath of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War, states turned once again to UN peacekeepers, as they have in dealing with the problems in the Congo and Darfur. 
But, while there are currently more than 100,000 troops from various nations serving in UN peacekeeping missions around the world, member states are not providing adequate resources, training, and equipment. 
Moreover, governments have found ways to delay effective international action, as has been the case in Sudan. 
It remains to be see whether China, concerned that its oil trade with Sudan might jeopardize the 2008 Olympics, will decide to exert more pressure. 
Similarly, while the General Assembly may have agreed that states have a “responsibility to protect,” many members agreed only in a very limited sense. 
Many developing countries, in particular, remain jealous of their sovereignty and fear that the new principle could infringe it. 
For example, in the aftermath of the recent government crackdown in Myanmar (Burma), the Secretary General was able to send a representative to the country, but with powers limited to reporting and attempted mediation. 
That may be enough to influence some governments, but the Burmese junta recently expelled the UN’s representative after he warned of “a deteriorating humanitarian situation.” 
The UN has impressive power – both hard and soft – when states agree on policies under Chapter 7 of the Charter. 
It has modest but useful soft power when great powers disagree but are willing to acquiesce in a course of action. 
And it has very little power when the great powers oppose an action, or repressive member governments ignore the claims of the new “responsibility to protect.” 
In such cases, it makes no sense to blame the UN. 
Soft power is real, but it has its limits. 
The fault lies not with the UN, but with the lack of consensus among member states. 
The Soft Underbelly of China’s Growth 
China’s explosive economic growth hinges on the rest of the world, radically changing the global production chain and challenging the global trading system. 
If China maintains its growth momentum over the next two decades, the global system will face huge challenges. 
Indeed, the question is not so much whether the global system will endure the imbalances spawned by China, but how severe those imbalances will prove to be. 
Much of the concern over the past few years has centered on America’s yawning current account and fiscal deficits, and its effort to get China to let the yuan float more freely against the dollar. 
China, by contrast, sees its growth as tied to a stable currency, and may not want to introduce a more flexible exchange-rate regime, even after the 2.1% revaluation in July, pending alleviation of structural problems for which it is extremely difficult to set a timetable. 
In fact, even as China’s economy has boomed over the past decade, structural adjustment in its domestic sectors slowed, mainly owing to political constraints. 
The banking system remains unhealthy and fragile; capital markets are dying. 
The private sector’s growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes.
