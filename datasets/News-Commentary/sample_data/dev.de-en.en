The fence assumes that they, as a people, are the source of the deadly threats to the settlers. 
Thus reigns the collectivist mentality that drives the unending feud between Jews and Palestinians. 
Not all Jews are guilty for the actions of a clique that might have violated international law. 
Nor should all Palestinians suffer as though they acted as a single entity, posing a collective terrorist threat. 
Only negotiations, not legal bickering, can put an end to this iniquity. 
The Sources of Chinese Conduct 
Mainstream thinking, known as the Chinese School, insists, with the government, on “Marxism with Chinese characteristics” as the bedrock principle of China’s foreign policy. 
But a minority school argues that China should rely instead on the country’s traditional political thought, emphasizing the universal value of traditional Chinese philosophy. 
The mainstream school defines China as a developing country, pointing to China’s per capita GDP, which ranks only 104th in the world. 
Today, the impact of the Chinese School seems to be limited mostly to official statements, while the traditionalists are gradually gaining policy influence. 
Early Confucian thinkers were writing in a world of small countries competing ruthlessly for territorial advantage. 
For them, the key to international power was political power, and the central attribute of political power was a morally informed leadership. 
Rulers, they believed, should act in accord with moral norms whenever possible. 
And the sphere of concern for any humane ruler should be the whole world, not just the people of one state. 
Thus, thinkers such as Mencius, Confucius’s leading intellectual heir, argued that humane authorities should punish immoral rulers in other states who tyrannize their people. 
Although China is building Confucius Institutes across the globe, China’s traditional political philosophy does not often play decisive role in policymaking. 
Domestic politics is always an important factor influencing a country’s foreign policy. 
According to early Confucian thinkers, a key task for rulers is to strive to improve a peoples’ happiness, which is itself grounded in a moral way of life. 
Because poverty was an obstacle to moral behavior, they believed that the state should be vitally concerned with eliminating it. 
The idea that the state should pursue economic growth without consideration for moral concerns was anathema to Confucius and his followers. 
Such statements sounded new to Chinese ears, because they accentuated politics rather than trumpeting the Party’s usual emphasis on economic determinism. 
But it is certain that the influence of traditional ideas in Chinese public life is growing. 
Indeed, no force seems able to reverse this trend in the coming years. 
US Interest Rates Will Continue to Rise 
That warning has already proved to be correct. 
But what of the future? 
The recent rise in long-term interest rates is just the beginning of an increase that will punish investors who are seeking extra yield by betting on long-term bonds. 
Given the current expected inflation rate of 2%, the real rate on ten-year bonds is still less than 1%. 
A higher rate of expected inflation would also cause the total nominal rate to be greater than 5%. 
Today’s investors may not recall how much interest rates rose in recent decades. 
It was only at the end of the 1970’s that the Fed, under its new chairman, Paul Volcker, tightened monetary policy and caused inflation to fall. 
But, even after disinflation in the mid-1980’s, long-term interest rates remained relatively high. 
In 1985, the interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds was 10%, even though inflation had declined to less than 4%. 
The greatest risk to bond holders is that inflation will rise again, pushing up the interest rate on long-term bonds. 
History shows that rising inflation is eventually followed by higher nominal interest rates. 
But the protection against inflation does not prevent a loss of value if real interest rates rise, depressing the value of the bonds. 
That was the same risk strategy that preceded the financial crisis in 2008. 
Investors need to recognize that reaching for yield could end very badly yet again. 
The Specter of Global Stagflation 
New York – Will rising global inflation lead to a sharp global economic slowdown? 
Even worse, will it revive stagflation, that deadly combination of rising inflation and negative growth? 
In emerging markets, inflation has – so far – been associated with growth, even economic overheating. 
They may then face “stagflation lite” – rising inflation tied to sharply slowing growth. 
Stagflation requires a negative supply-side shock that increases prices while simultaneously reducing output. 
This geopolitical risk mounted in recent weeks as Israel has grown alarmed about Iran’s intentions. 
Such an attack would trigger sharp increases in oil prices – to well above $200 a barrel. 
The consequences of such a spike would be a major global recession, such as those of 1973, 1979, and 1990. 
Indeed, the most recent rise in oil prices is partly due to the increase in this fear premium. 
Strong global growth in 2007 marked the beginning of a rise in global inflation, a phenomenon that, with some caveats (the sharp slowdown in the US and some advanced economies), continued into 2008. 
Barring a true negative supply-side shock, global stagflation is thus unlikely. 
Recent rises in oil, energy and other commodity prices reflect a variety of factors: 
Most of these factors are akin to positive global aggregate demand shocks, which should lead to economic overheating and a rise in global inflation. 
Large current-account surpluses and/or rising terms of trade imply that the equilibrium real exchange rate (the relative price of foreign to domestic goods) has appreciated in countries like China and Russia. 
Thus, over time the actual real exchange rate needs to converge – via real appreciation – with the stronger equilibrium rate. 
Unfortunately, the need for currency appreciation and monetary tightening in overheated emerging markets comes at a time when the housing bust, credit crunch, and high oil prices are leading to a sharp slowdown in advanced economies – and outright recession in some of them. 
The world has come full circle. 
Now the worries are about a stagflationary supply shock – say, a war with Iran – coupled with a deflationary demand shock as housing bubbles go bust. 
The Spires of Renewal 
PRAGUE - A dominant feature of Prague is the Gothic tower of the Cathedral of St. Vitus, St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert. 
That tower is now wrapped in scaffolding because – for the first time ever and, so to speak, at the eleventh hour – it is being renovated. 
Temporarily, the scaffold conceals the tower’s beauty. 
That concealment, however, is designed to preserve this beauty forever. 
Perhaps this scaffolding serves as an analogy for all postcommunist countries. 
An unprecedented feature of our global civilization is that it is basically atheistic, notwithstanding the billions of people who profess, whether actively or passively, to believe in a religion. 
Indeed, the underlying values of our global civilization rarely, if ever, relate to eternity, to the infinite and absolute. 
Everywhere there is a decline in concern for that which will come after us, and for the common interest. 
Humanity depletes non-renewable natural resources and interferes with the planet’s climate. 
Humanity becomes estranged from itself by gradually liquidating appreciable human communities and human proportions. 
Humanity tolerates a cult of material gain as the highest value to which all must yield and before which even the democratic will must sometimes fall to its knees. 
Creating wealth, indeed, has ceased to correspond with creating real and meaningful values. 
This denaturing of the spirit means that our civilization is wrought with paradoxes. 
It is opened to possibilities that, until recently, were mere fairy-tales. 
On the other hand, it holds only a limited ability to avert developments that infuse these possibilities with danger, or result in outright abuse. 
New sophisticated types of criminal activities, organized crime and terrorism, are emerging. 
Corruption flourishes. 
Various government and non-governmental organizations attempt, of course, to resolve these problems. 
For example, we often hear about the need to restructure the economies of poor countries, about wealthier nations being duty-bound to help in this. 
This is of greatest urgency for those who are better off in material terms. 
The course of today's global civilization, indeed, has been determined by the wealthiest and most advanced nations. 
For this reason, they cannot be relieved of the necessity to engage in a critical reflection. 
Many people and institutions are actively working toward this end. 
Only universal moral standards can generate natural respect for the rules we develop. 
Actions which jeopardize humanity’s future should not only be punishable but regarded as disgraceful. 
This will not happen unless we relate these values to something that lies beyond the horizon of our immediate personal or group interest. 
How can this be achieved without a new and powerful advance in human spirituality? 
What can be done to encourage such an advance? 
Whatever our convictions, we are all threatened by our shortsightedness. 
None of us can escape our common destiny. 
Allow me to return to the Cathedral of Saint Vitus, St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert. 
Why, in bygone ages, did people construct so costly an edifice, one with little use by today's standards? 
Upwards to be seen far and wide, highlighting to everyone that which is worth looking up to. 
Upwards, across the borders of ages. 
To begin to address some of the world’s deepest problems, we too must lift our eyes upwards as we bow our heads in humility. 
The Spirit of September 12 
This expensive, intensive effort – known as the “global war on terror” – can be counted as a success, a diversion, and an example. 
The most important fact about the last decade is that, since 9/11, there has been no successful foreign terrorist attack in the US. 
For that, US government efforts deserve credit. 
No doubt a good deal of the money spent to make the US safe has been wasted. 
And the group that launched the initial attacks, Al Qaeda, never posed the kind of massive threat that America’s great Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union, once did. 
Had they managed even a few more attacks similar to the ones on New York and Washington, they could have done serious damage. 
At worst, the US might have become a more closed, suspicious country, retreating from the openness that has been its hallmark. 
In terms both of money and bureaucratic procedures – carefully scrutinizing all airline passengers, for example – Americans may have overpaid for a decade of avoiding terrorist attacks. 
But overpaying was far preferable to suffering more attacks. 
The highest cost of the war on terror has come not from what the US did over the last decade, but from what it failed to do. 
Failure to deal effectively with these challenges will lower America’s rate of economic growth, thereby blocking generational upward mobility and undercutting the basis of US global influence. 
Over the last ten years, the US has not successfully addressed these four challenges. 
There are several reasons for this, but prominent among them is America’s decade-long focus on the threat of terrorism. 
The most pressing of these problems is the condition of the education system, which does not adequately prepare young Americans for the jobs available in an economy transformed by globalization and information technology. 
Moreover, while over-investing in airport security and in nation-building in the Hindu Kush and Mesopotamia, the US underinvested in the roads, bridges, laboratories, and scientists that it needs for economic growth. 
At the same time, America will need to invest in domestic infrastructure and research and development, which are key to innovation and economic growth. 
They produced the kind of resolve that will be required in the years ahead to address the equally important tasks that the US now faces. 
In the decade to come, the US must remain vigilant in order to prevent the kind of attacks that took place on September 11. 
The Spring of the Zombies 
New York – As spring comes to America, optimists are seeing “green sprouts” of recovery from the financial crisis and recession. 
The world is far different from what it was last spring, when the Bush administration was once again claiming to see “light at the end of the tunnel.” 
The metaphors and the administrations have changed, but not, it seems, the optimism. 
The good news is that we may be at the end of a free fall. 
The rate of economic decline has slowed. 
The bottom may be near – perhaps by the end of the year. 
But that does not mean that the global economy is set for a robust recovery any time soon. 
Hitting bottom is no reason to abandon the strong measures that have been taken to revive the global economy. 
This downturn is complex: an economic crisis combined with a financial crisis. 
Before its onset, America’s debt-ridden consumers were the engine of global growth. 
That model has broken down, and will not be replaced soon. 
The collapse of credit made matters worse; and firms, facing high borrowing costs and declining markets, responded quickly, cutting back inventories. 
We are likely to see a recovery in some of these areas from the bottoms reached at the end of 2008 and the beginning of this year. 
States are being forced to lay off workers as tax revenues plummet. 
The banking system has just been tested to see if it is adequately capitalized – a “stress” test that involved no stress – and some couldn’t pass muster. 
Worse still, they are being allowed to borrow cheaply from the United States Federal Reserve, on the basis of poor collateral, and simultaneously to take risky positions. 
Some of the banks did report earnings in the first quarter of this year, mostly based on accounting legerdemain and trading profits (read: speculation). 
But thiswon’t get the economy going again quickly. 
And, if the bets don’t pay off, the cost to the American taxpayer will be even larger. 
In a few years time, the banks will be recapitalized, and the economy will return to normal. 
This is the rosy scenario. 
But experiences around the world suggest that this is a risky outlook. 
And a weak economy means, more likely than not, more bank losses. 
The problems are not limited to the US. 
Other countries (like Spain) have their own real estate crises. 
Eastern Europe has its problems, which are likely to impact Western Europe’s highly leveraged banks. 
In a globalized world, problems in one part of the system quickly reverberate elsewhere. 
But this is a synchronous global downturn. 
America and Europe can’t export their way out of their doldrums. 
Fixing the financial system is necessary, but not sufficient, for recovery. 
America’s strategy for fixing its financial system is costly and unfair, for it is rewarding the people who caused the economic mess. 
It’s neither particularly complicated nor novel. 
Bondholders obviously don’t like it – they would rather get a gift from the government. 
But there are far better uses of the public’s money, including another round of stimulus. 
Every downturn comes to an end. 
The question is how long and deep this downturn will be. 
The State of the World 
NEW YORK – We all recognize today’s perils. 
A global financial crisis. 
A global energy crisis. 
A global food crisis. 
Trade talks have collapsed, yet again. 
There are new outbreaks of war and violence. 
Climate change ever more clearly threatens our planet. 
We say that global problems demand global solutions. 
And yet, do we act? 
In truth, today, we also face a crisis of a different sort – the challenge of global leadership. 
New centers of power and leadership are emerging – in Asia, Latin America and across the newly developed world. 
In this new world, the challenges are increasingly those of collaboration, not confrontation. 
Nations can no longer protect their interests, or advance the well-being of their people, without the partnership of the rest. 
Yet I see a danger of nations looking inward rather than toward a shared future. 
Their problems are part of the development emergency we face. 
Over the past year, the price of fuel, food, and commodities rose alarmingly. 
Wealthy countries worry about recession, while the poor can no longer afford to eat. 
The Millennium Development Goals are part of the solution. 
But progress here has been uneven. 
Pledges have not been honored. 
Yet we have achieved enough to know that the goals are within reach. 
The United Nations is the champion of the most vulnerable. 
When disaster strikes, we act. We did so this year in Haiti and other Caribbean nations hit by hurricanes. 
We did so after Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, where the challenge now is to push for political progress, including credible steps on human rights and democracy. 
We have helped people affected by severe flooding in Southeast Asia, and by drought in the Horn of Africa, where 14 million need emergency help. 
Since taking office, I have called for more strenuous action in Somalia. 
Must we wait – and see more children die in the sand? 
The global food crisis will not go away by itself. 
It may now have faded from the headlines. 
Last year at this time, rice cost $330 a ton. 
Today it is $730. 
People who used to buy rice by the bag now do so by the handful. 
Those who ate two meals a day now get by on one. 
The UN has focused on getting seeds and fertilizers into the hands of small farmers. 
We seek a new “green revolution” in Africa. 
But we lack new resources. 
The international community has not matched words with deeds. 
In Burundi and Sierra Leone, Liberia and Timor Leste, our resources are under strain because UN peacekeepers are helping nations turn the corner to peace. 
Yet the UN’s preventive diplomacy is often critical. 
We see the fruits in Nepal, Kenya and, we hope, Zimbabwe. 
Likewise, there is a real chance to reunify Cyprus. 
In Georgia, the UN can help ease the tensions resulting from the recent conflict. 
But it is dangerous to think that the UN can address today’s complex problems without the full backing of its member states. 
In Darfur, for example, we face a continuing challenge in meeting deployment deadlines. 
We lack critical assets and personnel. 
If not matched by resources, mandates are empty. 
And now all of our work – financing for development, social spending in rich nations and poor, the Millennium Development Goals, peacekeeping – is endangered by the global financial crisis. 
We need to restore order to international financial markets. 
We must think about a new global economic order that more fully reflects the changing realities of our time. 
The area of human rights, above all, demands our vigilance. 
Justice must be treated as a pillar of peace, security, and development. 
We must advance the “responsibility to protect.” 
Despite the real political difficulties, we cannot let crimes against humanity go unpunished. 
Climate change remains the defining issue of our era. 
We must regain our momentum. 
Our first test comes in three months in Poznan, Poland. 
By then, we need a shared vision of a new global climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012. 
The foundation of all the UN’s work is accountability. 
We need to change the UN’s culture. 
We must become faster, more flexible, and more effective – more modern. 
We must replace our current system of contracts and conditions of service, which are dysfunctional and demoralizing. 
But the UN’s Member States must be accountable as well. 
Resolutions mandating peace operations cannot continue to be passed without the necessary troops, money, and materiel. 
We cannot reform this organization without the required resources. 
Today’s uncertainties will pass, but only if we act wisely and responsibly. 
By doing so, we will set the stage for a new era of stability and global prosperity, more widely and equitably shared. 
The Stealth Threat to World Trade 
Threats to world trade come in many guises. 
What this practice entails is that countries negotiate lower tariffs on some types of products but not on others. 
Contrary to appearances, open sectoralism is not a first step to more comprehensive trade agreements. 
Indeed, it may prevent wider agreements from being negotiated. 
No country likes to open its manufacturing dinosaurs to foreign competition. 
The economic implications of such a stance, however, are perverse. 
America is the keenest supporter of open sectoralism, beginning several years ago with the “zero-for-zero” tariff negotiations during the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 
Those talks led ultimately to the dismantling of tariff barriers in ten key sectors. 
Pushed by business, the US negotiated sectoral agreements in telecoms, information technology, and financial services. 
With the support of the two most powerful actors in world trade, the ITA model has been pursued ever since in other sectors. 
Such agreements, which often dismantle not only tariffs but other regulatory barriers, may appear unassailable. 
But looks deceive. 
Indeed, the Japanese believe that the halfhearted backing of US business groups for a new round of WTO talks reflects the success of the earlier sectoral agreements. 
So Japan now opposes negotiating a second ITA, which it fears will further weaken political support for broad trade liberalization. 
Fears for the future of comprehensive, multi-sector trade negotiations are well founded. 
Moreover, a sector-by-sector approach invariably ignores a host of issues within the WTO, such as dispute settlement, anti-dumping, and the like. 
The recent experience of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum highlights the limitations of open sectoralism and should prompt a thorough re-appraisal. 
Following the launch of the ITA, America pressed APEC’s members for accelerated liberalization on a sectoral basis as a means to revive a stalled regional trade agenda. 
Policymakers who are now attracted to open sectoralism because of its delusive promise of frictionless politics should take that lesson to heart. 
It is this agenda, rather than the hollow hope of open sectoralism, that should be the main priority of trade negotiators in the future. 
The Stem-Cell Race Continues 
Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike. 
The episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research that is playing out in the field of stem cells. 
Possibly one of the biggest prizes in medical history is up for grabs, and anyone – truly anyone – could seize it. 
The last big scientific race of this type was the effort to map the human genome, which promises to alter future lives radically. 
A stem cell is special because it is able to reproduce a form that is different from itself. 
We need to know how this transformation is activated. 
Such knowledge would lead to huge, patentable advances. 
Most attention is focused on genetic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and to muscular dystrophy. 
In these cases, stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue. 
This would also benefit patients with brain and spinal injuries, or those who have suffered strokes and paralysis. 
There would be gains in parallel fields, too, such as gene therapy. 
Not surprisingly, given its huge potential, teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research. 
Any competent medical research center can enter the race, whether in Mexico, Ethiopia, Indonesia or Yemen. 
Whoever wins will have added the equivalent of a Saudi oil field to their economy. 
But, although anyone can win, science at this level is never a “eureka” event, with some single breakthrough suddenly ending the race. 
Discoveries occur incrementally, and, because it is science, each step is announced and tested. 
Research establishments gain momentum this way, with the leaders sweeping up talent, resources, and prestige in a rough-and-tumble intellectual ecology. 
Embedded in the larger race are many smaller ones, which jostle for early, impressive results. 
In May 2005, Hwang’s research center in Seoul reported the first major achievement. 
They claimed that they had developed a technique whereby new, perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones. 
More importantly, the Koreans did a common thing these days: they claimed patent rights over the process. 
It almost looked for a moment as though South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters. 
We now know that the Seoul researchers made up the whole thing. 
An investigation by a Seoul National University investigative panel has concluded that the “cloned” stem cells were really created by test-tube fertilizations. 
The fraud has bewildered the science community, particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false. 
Why, then, did they place their reputations and careers in jeopardy? 
Medical research has always faced many challenges, even when the scientific quest was simply one of discovery. 
Now, the challenges are complicated by politics, market forces, and national interests. 
With stem cell research, huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead, wherever their laboratory is located. 
As the competition heats up, we should expect amazing developments – and no doubt more public relations gimmicks. 
The Stimulus Ostriches 
There is nothing novel about this. 
It is very conventional short-run stabilization policy: you can find it in all of the leading textbooks...” 
I can understand (though I disagree with) opponents of the stimulus plan who believe that the situation is not that dire; that the government spending will be slow and wasteful (whereas properly targeted tax cuts would provide a more effective stimulus); and thus that it would have been better to defeat Obama’s stimulus bill and try again in a couple of months. 
Root-and-branch stimulus opponents whose work has crossed my desk recently include efficient-markets fundamentalists like the University of Chicago’s Eugene Fama, Marxists like CUNY’s David Harvey, classical economists like Harvard’s Robert Barro, gold bugs like the Council on Foreign Relation's Benn Steil, and a host of others. 
As far as I can tell, they are simply burying their heads in the sand. 
At the start of 1996, the US unemployment rate was 5.6%. 
Then America’s businesses and investors discovered the Internet. 
Over the next four years, annual US spending on information technology equipment and software roared upward, from $281 billion to $446 billion, the US unemployment rate dropped from 5.6% to 4%, and the economy grew at a 4.3% real annual rate as the high-tech spending boom pulled extra workers out of unemployment and into jobs. 
Over the next two years, annual US spending on residential construction roared upward, from $624 billion to $798 billion, the US unemployment rate dropped from 5.7% to 4.6%, and the economy grew at a 3.1% real annual rate. 
You can argue that neither group should have boosted its spending to such a degree – that both were subject to “irrational exuberance” – and that someone should have taken away the punchbowl earlier. But you cannot argue that these groups did not increase their spending, and that their increased spending did not pull large numbers of Americans – roughly two million in each case – into productive and valued employment. 
I simply do not see it. 
The Storm Before the Calm 
OXFORD – Central banks can stop worrying about inflation. 
Price deflation is far more likely in the near term. 
As recently as September and October, the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank both saw the risk of inflation as being roughly equal to the risk to growth. 
Both were reluctant to lower interest rates markedly. 
In October the US was on the cusp of the most significant turning point for inflation in the last 20 years. 
Of course, forecasting inflation is notoriously difficult. 
There have been large structural shifts in the world economy (e.g., trade and financial globalization) as well as in individual economies (such as the decline in trade union power). 
Monetary policy itself has shifted to a far greater focus on inflation. 
Moreover, energy and food price shocks can be both large and largely unpredictable, while the speed of price changes tends to increase with big shocks. 
Most forecasting models used by central banks therefore put a large weight on recent inflation. 
The turning point that the US and world economy are facing is straightforward. 
Global output is probably falling faster than at any rate since World War II, except perhaps for 1974-1975. Under these circumstances, large excess capacity develops and commodity prices fall. 
Indeed, it seems unlikely that governments in China and similar emerging markets can compensate swiftly enough to boost domestic consumption. 
And, with growing over-capacity, investment in goods production may fall even further, with serious implications for GDP. 
Hence demand for commodities, which has been driven by emerging-market growth, has fallen sharply, and help decrease global inflation. 
Eventually, lower commodity prices and lower inflation will act like a huge tax cut for households, allowing interest rates to fall further and thus stabilize economic activity. 
So the policy debate now under way is about whether monetary policy can stem deflation and what happens if and when the “zero lower bound” on interest rates is reached. 
But if nominal interest rates stay positive, while inflation is negative, then real interest rates may become too high for an economy in recession, causing recession to become more severe and prolonged. 
Ironically, that policy response helped to fuel the credit and housing bubble, whose collapse has triggered the current recession, which may actually bring about deflation. 
Thus, the emerging emphasis on recapitalizing the banking system and more recently, on unorthodox policies, including the purchase of private sector credit securities is correct. 
Finally, there are two major differences between the 1930’s and the present. 
The industrial world is now far more dependent on (mostly foreign) oil than it was then. 
The extreme rise in real oil prices was a major cause of the current recession, and its reversal will be a major factor in recovery. 
The other crucial difference is that we know enough not to repeat the errors – particularly trade protectionism – of the 1930’s. 
The Storm in Sub-Saharan Africa 
But the impact on poor countries is far more severe. 
Weak global growth is shrinking export markets, and many commodity prices are plunging. 
The combination of tighter credit conditions in the advanced economies and dimmer economic prospects in low-income countries is hitting investment flows. 
And workers’ remittances, which now eclipse aid as the biggest financial flows to low-income countries, are also falling. 
Sub-Saharan Africa depends heavily on commodity exports, so it is especially vulnerable to the global downturn. 
Many African countries have used the past decade to put in place sound and sustainable economic policies that have delivered robust growth and low inflation. 
Together with debt relief, these policies have resulted in low levels of public debt, relatively sound financial systems, and – most important – rising living standards. 
These gains are now at risk. 
The high food and fuel prices that prevailed until recently have taken a heavy toll on the finances of many African economies. 
Now they face a second blow from the global recession. 
This is not the time to take a break from efforts to achieve the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. 
Clearly, the responsibility to implement sound economic policies rests with African countries themselves. 
But the international community must stand ready to help. 
Here are three priorities that should guide us: 
This does not mean imposing rigid inflation targets. 
· Third, the international community is obliged to deliver on its commitment to increase aid. 
This is not the time to renege on those commitments. 
The IMF stands ready to do its part. 
We are working closely with our 53 African members on crafting the appropriate policy response. 
We have increased our financing to the countries most heavily affected by food and fuel shocks. 
We are also stepping up our technical assistance to strengthen economic policy making in Africa, and opening two new regional technical assistance centers. 
At the conference in Tanzania, we look forward to feedback and ideas about how the Fund can do even more – and differently. 
As Africa and its partners navigate the financial storm together, we must ensure that the most vulnerable are not forgotten. 
All eyes are focused right now on the immediate crisis. 
But we must not lose sight of the longer-term challenges that will remain after the storm abates. 
Our shared objective is clear: to ensure that Africa not only weathers the immediate storm, but emerges from it stronger. 
The Straits of America 
NEW YORK – Macroeconomic indicators for the United States have been better than expected for the last few months. Job creation has picked up. 
But, despite the favorable data, US economic growth will remain weak and below trend throughout 2012. 
Why is all the recent economic good news not to be believed? 
First, US consumers remain income-challenged, wealth-challenged, and debt-constrained. 
At the same time, US job growth is still too mediocre to make a dent in the overall unemployment rate and on labor income. 
The US needs to create at least 150,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis just to stabilize the unemployment rate. 
More than 40% of the unemployed are now long-term unemployed, which reduces their chances of ever regaining a decent job. 
Indeed, firms are still trying to find ways to slash labor costs. 
And most capital spending will continue to be devoted to labor-saving technologies, again implying limited job creation. 
At the same time, even after six years of a housing recession, the sector is comatose. 
Up to 40% of households with a mortgage – 20 million – could end up with negative equity in their homes. 
Given anemic growth in domestic demand, America’s only chance to move closer to its potential growth rate would be to reduce its large trade deficit. 
But net exports will be a drag on growth in 2012, for several reasons: 
· Slower growth in many advanced economies, China, and other emerging markets will mean lower demand for US exports. 
· Oil prices are likely to remain elevated, given geopolitical risks in the Middle East, keeping the US energy-import bill high. 
It is unlikely that US policy will come to the rescue. 
Given the bearish outlook for US economic growth, the Fed can be expected to engage in another round of quantitative easing. 
But the Fed also faces political constraints, and will do too little, and move too late, to help the economy significantly. 
Moreover, a vocal minority on the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is against further easing. 
In any case, monetary policy can address only liquidity problems – and banks are flush with excess reserves. 
Most importantly, the US – and many other advanced economies – remains in the early stages of a deleveraging cycle. 
This year will be no different, as public-sector deleveraging has barely started. 
Given all of these large and small risks, businesses, consumers, and investors have a strong incentive to wait and do little. 
The problem, of course, is that when enough people wait and don’t act, they heighten the very risks that they are trying to avoid. 
The Strange Death of Multiculturalism 
Of course, multiculturalism’s more thoughtful advocates never imagined that a cultural community could or should substitute for a political community. 
They believed that so long as everyone abided by the law, it was not necessary for citizens to have a single hierarchy of values. 
African dictators might do dreadful things but somehow they did not meet with condemnation from many European intellectuals, for criticism implied cultural arrogance. 
The Netherlands, where I was born, has perhaps been divided by the debate over multiculturalism more than any other country. 
But at the moment that multiculturalism’s advocates were making this suggestion, Dutch society was undergoing a dramatic transition. 
With secularization taking hold, the traditional pillars began to break down. 
But their turn away from multiculturalism is not what prevented the emergence of a “Islamic” pillar in Dutch society. 
In any case, it is now too late to create such a pillar. 
Whether Europeans like it or not, Muslims are part of Europe. 
Many will not abandon their religion, so Europeans must learn to live with them and with Islam. 
Of course, this will be easier if Muslims come to believe that the system also works to their benefit. 
Liberal democracy and Islam are reconcilable. 
Indonesia’s current political transition from dictatorship to democracy, although no unqualified success, shows that this is achievable. 
Of course, there are groups to which Islamism appeals. 
In the end, the only thing that can truly damage European values is Europe’s response to its non-Muslim majority. 
Fear of Islam and of immigrants could lead to the adoption of non-liberal laws. 
By defending Enlightenment values in a dogmatic way Europeans will be the ones who undermine them. 
Our laws prohibiting incitement to violence and insulting people for reasons of their religion are sufficient. 
Further constraints on freedom of speech – such as anti-blasphemy laws or, indeed, those laws that make Holocaust denial punishable – go too far. 
But this doesn’t mean that we should not weigh our words with care. 
We should distinguish carefully between different kinds of Islam, and not confuse violent revolutionary movements with mere religious orthodoxy. 
For such dogmatism undermines scepticism, the questioning of all views, including one’s own, which was and is the fundamental feature of the Enlightenment. 
The trouble today is that Enlightenment values are sometimes used in a very dogmatic way against Muslims. 
They have become in fact a form of nationalism – “our values” have been set against “their values.” 
The reason for defending Enlightenment values is that they are based on good ideas, and not because they are “our culture.” 
To confuse culture and politics in this way is to fall into the same trap as the multiculturalists. 
And it has serious consequences. 
If we antagonize Europe’s Muslims enough we will push more people into joining the Islamist revolution. 
We must do everything to encourage Europe’s Muslim to become assimilated in European societies. 
It is our only hope. 
The Strange Rebirth of American Leadership 
The world everyone knew simply and inexplicably seemed to disappear. 
Many Americans – think of the Tea Party’s adherents, for example – fear that something similar is happening to their own country. 
Or that it has already happened. 
Dangerfield based his diagnosis on a cross-section of institutions, politics, and personalities, set against the bitter class warfare of the time. 
Americans, however, have generally been averse to class warfare. 
True, the US has been home to a rigid, albeit comparably fluid, class structure ever since its founding. 
But Americans just don’t like to talk about it, even when they are whining about the follies of the “elite.” 
Nearly all Americans, apart from the richest and poorest, define themselves as “middle class.” 
Such remains America’s democratic ethos. 
Indeed, Chinese President Hu Jintao’s recent trip to Washington was seen by many – particularly many Chinese – as the passing of the torch. 
Pessimists have been saying this for a long time. 
Optimists, touting GDP and other indicators, will continue to insist that Americans have never had it so good. 
The former made a strong case for the necessity of American global hegemony; the latter warned of “imperial overstretch.” 
Both authors based their arguments on an assessment of the underlying context – that is, the structure – of world power. 
Similar arguments have been raised again recently. 
But are such writers making a valid point? 
Perhaps rise and fall is more of a cyclical than a linear phenomenon. 
Or maybe it’s neither. 
The missing variable in most of these arguments, even Nye’s, is leadership. 
Leaders are never bound to rise or fall by circumstances alone. 
Most historians place leadership in the foreground of human history, with structural variables having conditional, not causal, value. 
Beneath even the richest soil, Dangerfield wrote, may lie the most perilous residue of discord and destruction. 
Why have Americans been so good at leading? 
Are Americans specially blessed, or just lucky? 
The writers mentioned above are less interested in the essence of power than in its exercise. 
They would rather have the US become more sophisticated in the ways of the world. 
Americans don’t do this particularly well, however Byzantine their country’s own politics and policy-making may seem. 
Which takes us back to structure. 
The US political system was never designed to rule the world. Its checks and balances were meant to frustrate any such mission at the hands of an all-powerful executive, and it is doubtful that Americans would support such activism in perpetuity. 
Americans’ pragmatism, opportunism, fair-mindedness, inventiveness, adaptability, optimism, and, above all, their inherent competitiveness offset their tendencies toward violence, impatience, self-righteousness, and unpredictability, their fondness for novelty and celebrity for their own sake, and their self-assertion en masse – getting there, as they like to say, “fastest with the mostest.” 
That is still true, both at home and abroad. 
The Streets of 2012 
NEW YORK – What does the New Year hold for the global wave of protest that erupted in 2011? 
Did the surge of anger that began in Tunisia crest in lower Manhattan, or is 2012 likely to see an escalation of the politics of dissent? 
But we are also likely to see significant grassroots reaction. 
The UK has stringent internal-security legislation, but it never had a law like the United States Patriot Act. 
Ha’aretz calls the push “the new feudalism.” 
One should not be surprised to see similar legislation adopted in democracies worldwide. 
Indeed, increasingly sophisticated weapons systems and protective equipment are being disseminated to civilian police officers. 
The globalization of mercenaries to crack down on dissent is also proceeding apace. 
But this apparently coordinated pushback against global protest movements is not yet triumphant – not even in China, as the people of Wukan have shown. 
The Internet is also disseminating templates of what real democracy looks like – instantly and worldwide. 
Overwhelmingly, they want simple democracy and economic self-determination. 
Much is at stake. 
Depending on the outcome, the world will come to look either more like China – open for business, but closed for dissent – or more like Denmark. 
China’s Dream Team 
In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. 
While it is entirely premature to judge the style and direction that China’s new leaders will take, three early hints are worth noting. 
First, Xi’s assumption of power is more complete than was the case in earlier transitions. 
Moreover, he has long favored a market-friendly, scientific approach to economic development, which will be vital to China’s future. 
Second, Li Keqiang – the presumptive incoming premier – could be the big surprise in the new leadership team. 
His promotion could be a major step up from Wen, who emphasized rhetoric and strategy more than implementation. 
Yes, Wang has invaluable experience in the financial sector, and it would have been logical for him to assume similar responsibilities on the new leadership team. 
Having known Wang for more than 15 years, my sense is that he is very well suited to this vital task. 
The other members of the new Standing Committee bring a broad array of experience and skills. 
In fact, China is emerging in reasonably good shape from yet another global slump. 
None of this is to minimize China’s enormous challenges. 
But strategy is not the problem; the pro-consumption 12th Five-Year Plan lays that out with great clarity. 
Xi’s emphasis on the “top-level design” of reforms lends itself particularly well to this agenda, as does Li’s intimate familiarity with the detailed blueprint provided by China 2030. 
But the same could have been said of the early utterances of Deng, modern China’s greatest reformer. 
Those were not exactly enlightened words – especially in view of what was shortly to come. 
Yet Deng seized the moment at a critical juncture that is strikingly reminiscent of the one now faced by Xi and Li. 
Since the days of Deng, China has had an uncanny ability to rise to the occasion and meet its challenges head on. 
The new generation of leaders has the right skills and experience for the task. 
Western biases notwithstanding, we will know soon enough if they can translate strategy into action. 
The Stressed-Out Brain 
This burden of chronic stress, called “allostatic overload,” reflects not only the impact of life experiences but also our genetic constitution. 
There are three categories of stress: 
· Positive stress, for which a person feels rewarded by surmounting a challenge. 
· Toxic stress, which involves the same types of serious events, as well as the accumulation of daily struggles, but without good support systems. 
The difference between tolerable and toxic stress depends on the perceived degree of control that a person experiences. 
Moreover, low self-esteem exacerbates a feeling of helplessness and lack of control. 
Such a lack of recovery then requires medication, behavioral interventions, or both. 
For example, the immune system is enhanced by acute stress but suppressed by chronic stress. 
Among the most potent causes of stress in adult life are those arising from competitive interactions between animals of the same species, leading to the formation of dominance hierarchies. 
Such policies might well prevent disease, thereby saving money, reducing human suffering, and promoting healthier and more meaningful lives. 
The Stressful Life of Laboratory Animals 
In fact, animal studies have played a vital role in almost every major medical advance. 
This requires a thorough understanding of each animal species and its biology. 
Evidence is gradually accumulating that the majority of mammalian research animals, particularly rodents, are mentally stressed by their living conditions. 
These include high-pressure hoses, cage cleaners, and air-conditioners/heaters; squeaking doors, carts, and movable chairs; and jangling keys. 
Rodents, in particular, are sensitive to these noises, and studies show that this sensitivity does not diminish with time, as is commonly assumed. 
These noises can alter rodents’ behavior and even adversely affect their health. 
Yet, surprisingly, many scientists are unaware that loud noises in their animal facilities can affect research outcomes and compromise their data. 
Apart from noise problems, research animals are often housed in small cages with no source of enrichment, such as wheels, shelves, or tubes. 
Such devices enable animals to exert some control over their environment, such as escaping an attack from a cage-mate by moving to another level in the cage or hiding. 
Often, researchers are unwilling to include such items in their animals’ cages because other researchers do not. 
If animals are under stress, they can have permanently raised concentrations of stress hormones, reduced concentrations of sex hormones, and compromised immune systems. 
These uncontrolled variables make the animals unsuitable subjects for scientific studies. 
But the conclusions drawn from such experiments are specific to the stressed animals and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to healthy animals. 
The increasing use of genetically modified mice since their advent 20 years ago amplifies this problem. 
Studies are beginning to show that an animal’s environmental conditions can completely change the results of genetic studies. 
In addition, the environment should allow the animals to perform the behaviors normal for their species. 
Normal and aberrant behaviors for each species could be agreed upon institutionally and a list made available to all investigators. 
The exact conditions used to achieve these goals would probably vary between laboratories. But the end result would be similar. 
The Strong Force is Almost With Us 
HAMBURG – Roughly 60 years ago, the discovery of nuclear power promised the ultimate solution to the world’s energy problems. 
Today, this promise remains unfulfilled. 
Development of nuclear technology has stagnated, with nuclear power plants still using technology developed a half-century ago.amp#160; 
Nuclear energy is produced in the decay processes of heavy elements, like Uranium or Thorium. 
Indeed, in principle, every heavy element, even lead, is a potential source of nuclear energy. 
Everybody who has studied nuclear decay processes has been struck by the myriad possible ways in which energy can be produced. 
Progress in gaining access to this resource has, however, been very slow. 
From the scientific point of view, the main problem is a lack of knowledge. 
Despite many hundreds of well-functioning nuclear power plants, our understanding of nuclear forces is only empirical, and empirical knowledge is always imperfect. 
Another problem is the nuclear waste that emerges when energy is produced in the decay process. 
Here, too, however, we need more precise knowledge of the properties of nuclear processes. 
Around 50 years ago, it was proposed to study the strong forces by firing protons at each other at very high energies. 
Several large accelerator research centers were built, and the scattering of particles at high energies revealed a fascinating structure of matter. 
New particles, called gluons, were found to mediate the strong force. 
Their discovery should provide a clue to precise knowledge of the strong force. 
At short distances, gluons create an attractive force that is pretty weak and well understood. 
Therefore, for some time, it was not expected that the properties of the strong force could be directly derived from the properties of gluons. 
At the HERA accelerator, the scattering of electrons on protons was studied at the highest energies ever for this type of experiment. 
The HERA machine operated from 1992 until 2007. 
But the precision experiments required to measure the strong force can be designed and built with known technology. 
The study of these interactions should provide a precise understanding of the strong force. 
And, as the history of physics has shown, a better understanding of natural forces will open new, completely unexpected possibilities. 
A preciseunderstanding of the strong force could be just as important, opening new ways to use nuclear-energy resources while solving the problems of safety and nuclear waste. 
What’s Stopping Europe? 
Bad advice. 
French production costs are high, but Greek costs are higher. 
Despite the considerable decline in Greek (and Italian and Spanish) real GDP since 2007, adjustment is far from complete. 
In fact, one would be hard pressed to find broad agreement with Hollande’s assessment anywhere in Europe. 
Bondholders gain when interest rates fall. 
But unemployment continues to rise in the heavily indebted southern countries, and output continues to lag behind Germany and other northern European countries. 
The main reason for the lag is not simply low demand or large debts. 
There is a vast difference between unit labor costs – real wages adjusted for productivity – in Germany and in the heavily indebted southern countries. 
Production costs in other heavily indebted countries were 20-25% higher than in Germany. 
While some adjustment has occurred, much of the change is not permanent. 
Austerity reduced the number of employed workers, particularly those with low skill and productivity levels. But gains in measured productivity growth from this source are not permanent changes, so a large part of the reported reductions in unit labor costs are temporary. 
Indeed, major cost differences remain. 
In Greece, the private sector has been forced to adjust, but the government failed to keep its promise to reduce public employment. 
That will prolong excessive government spending, and deficit targets will not be met on a sustained basis. 
Large reductions in public-sector wages brought down the primary deficit, but employment maintenance lowers productivity, raises costs, and delays adjustment. 
In Italy, former Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government undertook some reforms, but it continued to support unions and corporate monopolies. 
And Italy’s parliament rejected many of Monti’s proposed reductions in government spending. 
Labor and many product markets remain closed, despite the urgent need to increase competition, lower production costs, and raise productivity. 
After five years of slow growth and rising unemployment, voters in other indebted countries, like Italians (and French voters before them), are likely to reject additional spending reductions, tax increases, and further painful deregulation. 
The economic historian Harold James has shown in a recent book that in the 40 years of negotiations leading to the adoption of the common currency, all of the problems that now beset the eurozone were discussed repeatedly. 
But such rules were never adopted. 
Before the euro, countries adjusted misaligned production costs by devaluing or revaluing their exchange rates. 
Fiscal austerity is a poor substitute. 
It works slowly, if at all, because elected governments are often reluctant to implement their promises – and may not feel bound by those of previous administrations (especially if they owe their victory to voters who are rebelling against years of belt-tightening with no evidence of renewed growth). 
For several years, I have proposed a policy that combines growth and fiscal rectitude. 
Let all the heavily indebted southern European countries jointly agree to join a weak euro, which would float against the stronger northern euro. 
When the weak euro reduces the heavily indebted countries’ production costs by 20-25%, they can rejoin the “hard” euro if they accept fiscal reforms that are subject to approval by the European Commission (and thus by the hard-euro creditor countries). After all, a fixed exchange rate or common currency requires limits on fiscal independence. 
After five years of decline in living standards, voters oppose more austerity and further retrenchment without growth. 
Restoring a sound euro requires policies that revive growth, rein in government spending, and reform heavily regulated labor and product markets. 
The Structure of Institutional Reforms 
FRANKFURT – Despite abundant talk in Europe nowadays, there is no crisis of the euro. 
Some countries, instead, are dealing with a sovereign-debt crisis and the consequences of inadequate economic reform. 
The challenges are characteristic not only for the euro area. 
Most advanced economies around the globe are facing similar problems. 
All countries need to draw firm conclusions from the current crisis. 
When the global financial crisis erupted, the euro shielded countries that in comparable circumstances would have been plunged into a deep currency crisis. 
This shield may, perhaps, have worked too well because the more weakly performing countries faced no discipline from financial markets. 
Market participants – including ratings agencies – either flagrantly misapprehended risk or never took the Maastricht Treaty’s no-bailout clause seriously. 
Meanwhile, the institutional mechanisms implemented for coordination of economic and fiscal policies remained idle. 
As long as Europe’s potential sinners continue to judge its de facto sinners, peer pressure will not work. 
Indeed, deficit-reduction programs were all too often founded on overly optimistic growth assumptions, and in times of robust economic growth, debt reduction was neglected. 
All of these failures became fully manifest in 2005, when European governments watered down the Stability and Growth Pact’s rules to a degree that effectively made them optional. 
The European Central Bank was critical of that decision, whose dramatic consequences have exceeded our greatest fears. 
The financial crisis hit fragile public budgets with full force. 
The effect of automatic stabilizers in the economic downturn, state support for banks, and the fiscal stimulus packages adopted by governments all undermine fiscal sustainability. 
Financial markets’ sudden reappraisal of sovereign risk has now put euro-area governments under considerable pressure to reduce their deficits. 
But there is a risk that fiscal consolidation will wane as soon as a degree of deficit reduction has calmed the markets. 
To minimize that risk, euro-area countries must fundamentally re-work and strengthen the institutional architecture for coordinating long overdue structural reforms and for safeguarding public finances. 
These efforts will require far-reaching reforms. 
Indeed, reducing the current high debt levels in the euro area will require substantial consolidation. 
First, governments should bring fiscal deficits down to below 3% of GDP, in line with what has been agreed by the European Council. 
Second, to set high debt ratios on a diminishing path, governments will have to aim at reducing deficits further in line with their medium-term budgetary objectives. 
Such sanctions should begin to be imposed when governments fail to meet minimum requirements for attaining medium-term objectives. 
They should then become incrementally more severe the longer and the more seriously the rules are breached. 
Where structural policy is concerned, we need a better architecture for overseeing and safeguarding individual countries’ competitiveness, and for eliminating imbalances. 
This calls for competitiveness to be monitored, and made subject to surveillance. 
Countries should be assigned to a risk group in line with their economic vulnerability. 
Some have proposed establishing a new institution for crisis management, which would most likely require a treaty change. 
But, if the reforms in the realm of fiscal policy and coordination of economic policy are successful, such an institution would never need to act, and would thus be redundant. 
Structural reforms and fiscal consolidation are, incidentally, tasks not only for countries with a current-account deficit. 
Surplus countries, too, must adopt measures to strengthen the domestic economy by creating incentives for investment and employment. 
These adjustment measures are painful but necessary. 
Without structural reforms to strengthen employment and growth, even the most earnest efforts to foster recovery will come to nothing both economically and politically. 
The Struggle for Mastery in Iran 
Conservatives want not only to silence the reformers, but to provoke confrontation. 
For if the reformers are incited into demonstrating and street chaos ensues, the security forces will have a handy excuse for a crackdown. 
In the state of emergency likely to follow, installation of a new parliament might be delayed. 
Recognizing this, reform leaders urge restraint on their supporters. 
They are confident about eventual triumph, because the majority of youth and women support reform. 
Two thirds of Iran's 65 million people are under 25 years old. 
But young people in Iran, as everywhere, are not known for patience. 
Here lies the threat of unrest. 
Tension is rife because, although the economy is a shambles, no one is doing anything about it. 
Those campaigning for reform are mostly interested in the social and political changes called for by President Khatami under the rubric of 'civil society' and the 'rule of law.' 
The President himself seems not very interested in economics. 
He should be. 
Unemployment is high, especially among young Iranians. 
The total workforce will reach 17.7 million by the end of the current five-year plan, with 2.8 million or 15.8% unemployed. 
More than 50% of university graduates cannot find jobs, and now look abroad for work. 
Growth is the only viable solution to all this, but it is nowhere to be seen amidst state controls and rampant corruption. 
This year's real GDP is expected to grow a mere 1.5%. 
Even for those in work, incomes are low - especially, in relative terms, for professionals. 
But the real cause is the inertia of state control. 
The Iranian economy is 80% state-owned (as provided in the revolutionary constitution - article 44) and prices of basic goods are controlled. 
Massive subsidies are needed to finance the raw material inputs of state companies, and these consume the bulk of the government's oil revenues (10% of GDP). 
Subsidies combined with a bloated civil service (there are over 2 million state employees) generate chronic budget deficits, estimated at 5% of GDP in 1998-99. 
Worse, the deficit is financed by printing money, fanning inflation, which reached 24% in 1998-99 and is rising. 
Labour market liberalization is the most necessary reform. 
Existing labour laws (introduced after 1979) make it costly for employers to hire workers, who benefit from compulsory bonuses and generous severance payments. 
Another key target should be the bonyads (charitable foundations). 
Such distortions need to be replaced by investment, both from repatriated flight capital and foreign sources. 
Both should come, lured by the country's rich natural resources. 
But investment is impossible without privatization, to which the regime has an ideological allergy. 
Rapprochement with the outside world would help. 
Here, America is the key. 
Seemingly balked on political reform, President Khatami should focus on economic renewal which, when it comes, might revive his political agenda too. 
The Struggle for Mastery of the Pacific 
TOKYO – On May 1, the Shanghai Expo began, illuminated by a huge fireworks display. 
The festivities will continue until the end of October. 
In 1970, Japan celebrated its own tremendous postwar economic growth with the Osaka Expo, as well as by launching the Bullet Train. 
There are reasons to doubt that it will. 
The Chinese navy, it is now believed, is trying to achieve that very aim. 
China’s ambition is marked by muscle flexing. 
Japan protested, describing the incident as an “extremely dangerous act.” 
Once again, a Chinese military helicopter circled a Japanese escort ship. 
Although reconnaissance flights by Russia’s Air Force frequently occur in Japan’s northern skies, both countries understand the need for caution in their actions. 
The Japanese and Chinese militaries, however, do not have sufficient ties to create confidence that caution will prevail. 
Nothing of the sort is happening. 
By promising in last summer’s election campaign to expel America’s bases on Okinawa, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama put himself in a bind. 
It now appears that he wants to backtrack on his promise, but massive protests are inhibiting him from doing so. 
China’s struggle for mastery in the Pacific is now raising fears in Japan. 
The worry is that such a council could legislate in ways “friendly” to neighboring states, which might compromise Japan’s national security dramatically. 
Even Hatoyama’s defense minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, who had been prone to naïve remarks on the issue, appears to have come to his senses. 
He is now calling for the construction of a Self-Defense Force base on Yonaguni. 
But the situation on the island demonstrates anew that China is prepared to take advantage of every misstep that the gaffe-prone Hatoyama government makes. 
Indeed, the growing contest between India and China is not only military in nature, but also concerns the acquisition of natural resources. 
By controlling the sea lanes, China hopes to gain leverage over India’s capacity for economic growth. 
Chinese military expansion has seen double-digit annual growth for 22 years. 
But there remain doubts about the true level of China’s military spending, owing to a pronounced lack of transparency in the budget process. 
It remains unclear, for example, whether the research and development costs for an aircraft carrier are included. 
History has repeatedly demonstrated that such ambiguity, particular if practiced by a rising power, can spark an arms race. 
China claims that it is entitled to play a role in setting the rules that govern the international system. 
China should, of course, play such a part. 
The Struggle for Syria 
CAIRO – As the violence in Syria mounts, the international community’s paralysis has become increasingly jarring. 
But the role of external regional forces is almost as important in fueling the domestic bloodshed as what is happening internally. 
If Syria could break free of the negative influences of regional politics, genuine change without continued violence might become possible. 
Syria needs to manage its diverse ethnic and religious composition, and to decide its own position on the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
But that is more difficult when neighboring countries are exploiting the country's heterogeneous makeup to pursue their own hegemonic agendas. 
Syria, after all, sits at the center of mighty and antagonistic geopolitical forces. 
To the east looms Iran, with its anti-American, anti-Western rhetoric and vast regional ambitions. 
To the south sits Saudi Arabia, with its long friendship with the United States and its inherent hostility toward Iran's Islamic Republic. 
And to the north is Turkey, a pro-European, largely secular and democratic country that seeks to wield influence across the Arab world. 
The region in and around Syria is also populated by extremist Islamist groups that are attempting to expand their spheres of influence - and that are quick to capitalize on instability in any country. 
Syria is particularly vulnerable in this regard, as extremists incite violence against minority religious groups by using, for example, television stations in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. 
The current regime in Syria, in its ruthless quest to remain in power, refuses to acknowledge peaceful protesters' demands for freedom and dignity. 
If it did - and if it met those demands - Islamists would not be able to hijack the demonstrations. 
In fact, the obsession with Syria's sectarian rivalries provides destabilizing external forces with the oxygen that their inflammatory rhetoric requires. 
The international community allowed change in Tunisia and Egypt to proceed at those countries' own pace. 
In Syria, a Libyan-style military intervention is not warranted, but diplomatic intervention is needed to allow the country's people to determine its future. 
The international community's goal must be to persuade neighboring countries to halt their brazen, unwarranted attacks on parts of Syrian society. 
Likewise, efforts to weaken Iran's disruptive influence in the region must be maintained, while Turkey's regional ambitions must be kept in mind. 
Dramatic, rapid change could result in prolonged failure. 
Fortunately, Syrians have no predilection for violence. 
For them, peaceful, gradual change is the best option. 
The situation in Syria is usually – and rightly – described as an intricate, multi-dimensional playing field with a wide variety of political actors and competing interests. 
But there has been an inadequate focus on the Syrian people’s simple desire for genuine reform, greater personal freedom, and more economic opportunity. 
Syrians have experienced uninterrupted dictatorship for 40 years, and, with it, extreme economic hardship, including high unemployment, rising food prices, and endemic corruption. 
They are also now suffering from water shortages and a budget deficit that has been exacerbated by declining oil revenues. 
But Syrians are a remarkably resilient, resourceful people, as well as being young and well educated 
A new Syria, based on democratic principles, would not only benefit Syrians, but would be a force for stability throughout the region. 
The Sugar Season 
The holiday season that is now upon us is a time for festivity, and usually of overeating. 
But the rampant consumption of sugar that marks this time of year is nothing to celebrate. 
In fact, this seasonal upsurge in sugar consumption is just part of a huge transition in world health that is now underway. 
Many countries, especially developing countries, are facing the consequences of huge changes in lifestyle: modifications in diet, lower levels of physical activity, and increased tobacco use. 
These changes are determined, to a large extent, by the globalization and expansion of food markets, and by ever-greater levels of urbanization. 
Both of these factors incite sedentary behavior at home and at work, as well as profound alterations in dietary habits. 
Indeed, they account for almost half the global burden of disease. 
By 2020, that contribution is expected to rise to 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden of disease. 
Recent data from China reflect the extent of the problem. 
In China's rural areas, with more than 800 million people, NDC's account for more than 80% of deaths. 
Many countries are now afflicted by a double burden of diseases. 
One of the strategy's key conclusions is that reducing the burden of NCD's requires a multi-sectoral approach. 
Like a toolbox, the strategy provides WHO members with a comprehensive range of policy options from which to choose. 
Governments can act. 
Transport ministries should provide safe roads so that children can bike to school. 
Finance ministers could tax unhealthy food and subsidize healthy food. 
Education ministers should demand healthy school meals. 
Many countries are already developing their own national strategies. 
Most of what WHO is recommending has been endorsed by public health officials for many years. 
But we face a global problem, with many international stakeholders, and this requires an urgent and worldwide response. 
Of course, there is considerable debate about what precisely makes for a healthy diet. 
But there has been no challenge to the strategy's recommendations from the global scientific or public health community. 
The strongest critique has come from sugar associations, who claim that the upper limit of 10% on caloric intake from sugar is not based upon scientific evidence. 
However, more than twenty national and international reports from around the world by scientific bodies governing dietary recommendations set similar or lower targets for sugar intake. 
The growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health. 
The Suicide of Hong Kong 
China has been celebrating the five year anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland from British rule. 
Firecrackers, dragon dancers, and President Jiang Zemin's visit marked the festivities. 
Hong Kong's ruling elite delights in telling foreign visitors how wrong pessimistic predictions of the territory's have proven to be. 
Fortune, for example, once entitled a cover story "The Death of Hong Kong." 
That article forecast heavy-handed meddling by Beijing in local affairs, which would allegedly emasculate the vitality of Hong Kong's economy. 
The article was wrong, because Hong Kong's deepest wounds have not come from China's ruler, but are self-inflicted. 
Tung Chee Hwa, Hong Kong's leader, insists that the "one country, two systems" scheme devised by Deng Xiaoping works perfectly. 
The Financial Secretary, Anthony Leung, last year boasted that Hong Kong would become Asia's "Manhattan Plus." 
Chief Secretary Sir Donal Tsang calls negative assessments of the territory the product of second-rate minds. 
But official bravura has little sympathy beyond this narrow circle. 
Mr. Tung, the scion of a shipping empire, and his tycoon friends like to blame Britain's colonial government for leaving behind "time bombs" that make Hong Kong look bad. 
Local officials soon began to broaden their attack. 
Humbled and humiliated, the Court has acted timidly since. 
Locals now call it the "Court of Semi-Final Appeals." 
Soon after the meeting, senior university officials warned the pollster that further funding for his work might not be forthcoming. 
Robert Kuok, the Malaysian owner of Hong Kong's major English language newspaper, the South China Morning Post , is one of Mr. Tung's friends and fiercely loyal to China's leaders. 
In 2001, the journalist Willy Lam, a respected China expert, was sacked from the paper after Mr Kuok publicly berated him for his views on China's rulers. 
President Jiang and China's rulers have had very little, if anything, to do with any of these decisions. 
They were taken because Mr. Tung and his allies wish to demonstrate how in tune they are with official thinking on the mainland. 
But are they in tune? 
The presumption that China wants Hong Kong to become more like the mainland is ludicrous. 
China has had entirely too much of the "one country." 
What it wants now is the "two systems." 
True, China's ruling elite remains a Leninist party prepared to crush all potential threats to its monopoly of power. 
In other words, China is looking for a new system to replace the existing one. 
Instead, his behavior is reminiscent of a feudal district official whose main priority is to ensure that his superiors are treated with due reverence. 
Nor is Mr. Tung alone. 
Much of Hong Kong's elite shares the same mindset, despite their training in Western business schools and their fortunes gained from property trading. 
Their priority is to nurture a cozy relationship with Chinese officialdom -- much of which can be easily bought. 
Whether Hong Kong remains an open, liberal society has never been a major issue for them. 
What China regards as Hong Kong's comedy of deference is quickly becoming a tragedy of errors for Hong Kong's citizens. 
The Summit of Low Expectations 
Indeed, that outcome appears likely. 
The problem is as much the fault of the United States as it is of the Chinese. 
With the Copenhagen climate summit only weeks away, forging a commitment on climate change is the most pressing challenge. 
The US and China are the world’s two biggest emitters of carbon dioxide. 
Unfortunately, the two countries stand on opposing sides on climate change. 
China speaks for the developing world in demanding to be let off the hook from committing to a specific national carbon-reduction target. 
The US, Europe, and other industrialized states caused the problem, the Chinese say, so they bear the most responsibility for solving it. 
On the ground, Chinese actions to address climate change are impressive. 
Without any credible commitments by America, how can Obama ask China to do more? 
But they refuse to accept that this was the root cause of the crisis. 
To the Chinese, as well as to others, it is obvious that the main cause of the crisis was America’s flawed financial system. 
Neither side will volunteer to bear the costs of recalibrating the relationship. 
But, beneath the surface, clear differences in strategy will emerge. 
Indeed, Chinese trade and investment are spurring market activity in North Korea’s northern region. 
Why not reach out to North Korea the way you are toward Iran and Burma, Hu may ask Obama? 
But the US Congress might well cry “appeasement” if Obama dared to propose engaging – and changing – North Korea in this way. 
Hu and Obama will work hard to present an image of unity during the summit. 
Both sides want to prevent any serious rupture. 
But substantive agreements on climate change, the financial crisis, or North Korea would require both countries to take actions that could be domestically costly. 
The era when China made all the compromises in the relationship has passed. 
The Sunflower Revolutionary 
No one cares whether they are humiliated or crushed under foot (as the seeds were allowed to be at the exhibition’s opening). 
Unfortunately, Ai has become one of the seeds, his freedom crushed by the heel of an inhuman state. 
The Chinese official newspaper Global Times denounces Ai as a “maverick,” and mavericks are not tolerated in China. 
The only way for a Chinese individual to survive is to adopt the grey, anonymous way of the sunflower seed. 
In fact, China’s government has yet to decide whether to prosecute Ai for economic crimes or for being “maverick.” 
Either way, the outside world must not be allowed to have any idea as to what fate awaits Ai. 
But the true reason for Ai’s arrest is obvious. 
When the police stormed Ai’s workshop, they demanded that Ai’s wife, Lu Qing, tell them, “What did Ai write on the Internet?” 
He must be put under control, silenced. 
Of course, the ruling Chinese Communist Party is prefabricating Ai’s prosecution. 
It is as if three decades after China’s “opening,” nothing has changed in the Party’s way of thinking and ruling. 
Ai graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1978, but he learned and developed his artistic talents in the United States. 
His Shanghai workshop used to be a salon for Chinese artists, including the film directors Chen Kaige and Jiang Wen. 
But Ai never allowed himself to be hired as an official regime hack. 
On the day of Ai’s arrest, former Global Times journalist Wen Tao was grabbed off the street in broad daylight. 
Other young Beijing artists have been detained as well. 
To be sure, the regime considers Ai’s arrest a preemptive measure to prevent the outbreak of public demonstrations. 
But Ai never participated in the many Internet appeals for such protests. 
And his arrest seems to be just the beginning. 
The next targets will likely be independent writers like Ai Xiaoming, Dai Qing, Cui Weiping, and Han Han. 
The regime will not stop the persecution until the only voices to be heard are its own “official” artists. 
This process is nothing new. 
The writer Li Hong received a six-year prison sentence and died in a hospital under police supervision last year. 
Another writer, Li Xianbin, was sentenced to 10 years. 
According to the Writers in Prison Committee of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, more than 30 of the country’s writers are currently locked up. 
China’s relentless economic rise is bringing with it a decadence of civilization. 
The feast of new wealth is accompanied by a famine of morality. 
Ai used to argue that the Chinese regime’s despotism is boosted by shameless liars. 
He always understood that true art and politics can never march hand-in-hand. 
They must eventually confront each other on the field of a free conscience. 
The “Arab awakening” tells something else about those sunflower seeds at the Tate Modern: the seeds, once they come together, show their unity and power. 
The Sustainability Mindset 
MILAN – Markets and capitalist incentives have great strengths in promoting economic efficiency, growth, and innovation. 
Obviously, abandoning market-capitalist systems, and implicitly growth, is not really an option. 
Of these three imperatives, sustainability may be the most complex and challenging. 
For many people, sustainability is associated with finite natural resources and the environment. 
Thus, there is a well-founded fear that the planet’s natural resources (broadly defined) and recuperative capacities will not withstand the pressure. 
To some, this logic leads to the conclusion that growth is the problem, and that less growth is the solution. 
But, in developing countries, where only sustained growth can lift people out of poverty, limiting it cannot be the answer. 
The alternative is to change the growth model in order to lighten the impact of higher levels of economic activity on natural resources and the environment. 
But there is no existing alternative to which we can all switch. 
Changing the growth model means inventing a new one over time, step-by-step, from complementary parts. 
The two key ingredients seem to be education and values. 
Everyone, not just policymakers, needs to understand the consequences of our individual and collective choices. 
Thus far, the quality of our choices has been unimpressive, reflecting little sensitivity to sustainability and the impact of our choices on future generations. 
As a result, many developed countries have built up dangerously large public debts and even larger non-debt liabilities, owing to unsustainable growth patterns. 
Most of us, I believe, do not knowingly make choices that adversely affect future generations. 
So perhaps incomplete knowledge of the consequences of our choices is responsible. 
That seems unfair, because it is. 
But we might still fail to reach agreement on who should pay for funding these programs, or for reducing our consumption of resources. 
Education and values are the foundation of sound individual and, ultimately, collective choices. 
If sustainability is to triumph, it must be predominantly a bottom-up process. 
Environmentalists are right to focus on education and individual choices, even when their policy proposals are not always on target. 
Education and values will drive local innovation, alter lifestyles, and shift social norms. 
They will also affect business behavior via choices by customers and employees, including business leaders. 
Thus, they are essential components of the formulas needed to pursue sustainable patterns of growth. 
But, while education and values are necessary, they clearly are not sufficient. 
Complementary national policies and international agreements will require careful scientific and economic analysis and thoughtful choices. 
The need for burden-sharing, particularly between advanced and developing countries, will not magically disappear. 
Climate-change risks, though serious, should not be mistaken for the entire sustainability agenda. 
There are clear steps that can be taken. 
Appropriate regulation and sufficiently long time horizons can make structures of all kinds much more energy-efficient, without imposing burdensome costs. 
In a similar way, transportation can become less energy-intensive without restricting mobility. 
Some of these shifts might be subject to international coordination, in order to avoid adverse competitive consequences, whether real or perceived. 
But too much coordination can be a bad thing. 
Likewise, businesses and industries that are heavy water users will simply develop new technologies and thrive in the face of scarcity. 
This perspective perhaps comes more naturally in an environment of rapid growth, because their growth models require continual review and adaptation to be sustainable. 
Over time, values shift as knowledge is acquired and disseminated. 
Policies aimed at sustainability are likely to follow. 
What is unknown is whether we will reach that point fast enough to avoid major disruptions, or even potential conflict. 
The Suzuki Alliance 
TOKYO – The name “Suzuki” is the most popular surname in Japan and the brand name of the most popular car in India. 
For a long time, Indians have used bicycle rickshaws or auto rickshaws for daily transportation. 
The word “rickshaw” originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha, which literally means “human-powered vehicle.” 
The fact that Suzuki is now practically synonymous with automobile in India suggests how close the relationship between the two countries can be. 
Indeed, India and Japan are natural allies. 
Their strategic interests are almost perfectly aligned, and each shares a desire to stabilize and preserve Asia’s balance of power. 
So it is no surprise that Japan is pushing to develop closer economic and strategic ties with India. 
Currently, Maruti Suzuki India Limited has more than 4,000 employees and a nationwide sales network of 337 dealers with 8,600 salespersons. 
The reason why Suzuki entered the Indian market is clear. 
Suzuki chose an untapped market while Japan’s bigger automakers – Toyota, Nissan, and Honda – engaged in fierce competition within Japan. 
Indeed, while there are currently more than 19,000 Japanese companies in the Chinese market, there are only about 260 in India. 
Suzuki’s decision to enter the Indian market turned out to be a resoundingly wise choice. 
Japan’s population peaked in 2004 and is now falling, while its younger generations show diminishing interests in automobiles. 
In the past, young Japanese were proud of their knowledge about cars, and every teenage boy knew which model would attract the most girls. 
Today, however, Japanese driving schools suffer from a fall-off in students, which cannot be explained solely by declining population. 
India’s population, on the other hand, is increasing dramatically in the absence of a one-child policy, such as exists in China. 
It makes sense, then, that Japanese companies should head to the expanding Indian market. 
Doing so, moreover, makes geo-strategic sense as well, with successive Japanese governments increasingly regarding India as a vital diplomatic and political partner. 
These shared values distinguish the Japan-India relationship from Japan’s relationship with China. 
The growing congruence of strategic interests led to the 2008 Japan-India security agreement, a significant milestone in building a stable geo-political order in Asia. 
The emerging Japan/India partnership looks like a necessary foundation for pan-Asian security in the 21st century. 
These discussions include joint initiatives on maritime security, counterterrorism, weapons proliferation, disaster prevention and management, and energy security. 
More is needed. 
India and Japan should, for example, jointly develop new defense capacities. 
Today, India and Japan cooperate on missile defense in partnership with Israel and the US. 
Bilateral efforts should also be launched to develop other defense technologies. 
Suzuki’s joint venture in India suggests that cooperation in high-tech manufacturing is eminently possible. 
Osamu Suzuki may not be willing to share all of the secrets of his success with his competitors, but they and Japanese diplomats should be studying the Suzuki method. 
Japan’s economy and Asian security depend on its replication. 
The Swedenization of Europe 
Anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are becoming linked and ever more rabid in today's Europe. 
They arise from a kind of blindness, combined with a strange mixture of alienation, guilt, and fear toward both Israel and America. 
Millions of Europeans resist seeing Israel as a country fighting for its survival. 
Israel cannot afford to lose one major war, as it would mean the end of the Jewish democratic state. 
Something similar is at work in the European attitude to the US. 
Look at Europe, many Europeans say, we have eradicated wars, dangerous nationalism, and dictatorships. 
We created a peaceful European Union. 
We do not wage war; we negotiate. 
We do not exhaust our resources on weapons. 
The rest of the planet should learn from us how to live together without terrorizing each other. 
As a Swede, I have heard such pacific boasting all my life: that neutral Sweden is a moral superpower. 
Now this bragging has become the EU's ideology. 
We are the moral continent. 
Call this the "Swedenization" of Europe. 
But what Europe forgets is how those ideologies were overcome. 
Without the US Army, Western Europe would not have been liberated in 1945. 
Without the Marshall Plan and NATO, it would not have taken off economically. 
West Europeans also forget that some areas of the world have never known freedom. 
In many places, torture chambers are the rules of the game, not the grotesque and shameful mistakes of ill-supervised troops. 
Any attempt in such places to go behave the European way and negotiate - without the military power needed to back up diplomacy - would be pathetic. 
This is a new European illusion. 
Spain's latter day appeasement à la Munich arises from this thinking. 
The triumph of terrorists would have been transformed into a triumph of the war on terror. 
The images many Europeans hold of America and Israel create the political climate for some very ugly bias. 
You have the Great Satan and the Small Satan. 
America wants to dominate the world - exactly the allegations made in traditional anti-Semitic rhetoric about the Jews. 
Indeed, modern anti-Zionist rhetoric portrays Israel's goal as domination of the whole Middle East. 
Such ideas are reflected in opinions polls in which Europeans claim that Israel and the US are the true dangers to world peace. 
Ian Buruma, the British writer, claims that this European rage against America and Israel has to do with guilt and fear. 
The two world wars led to such catastrophic carnage that "never again" was interpreted as "welfare at home, non-intervention abroad." 
The problem with this concept is that it could only survive under the protection of American might. 
Extreme anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism are actually merging. 
Much of this grows from a subconscious European guilt related to the Holocaust. 
Now the Holocaust's victims - and their children and grandchildren - are supposedly doing to others what was done to them. 
By equating the murderer and the victim, we wash our hands. 
Like Jews, they are in thrall to a fundamentalist religion that renders them self-righteous and dangerous. 
The links between anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are all too real. 
Unless Europe's leaders roundly condemn this unholy triple alliance, it will poison Middle East politics and transatlantic relations alike. 
The Tabloid Syndrome 
The world is a complex and intricate place. 
So how are we to understand even just a piece of it, say, the United States government and its economic policies? 
Big winners are workers in poor countries who get better jobs working for firms that can now export services to rich countries. 
But even in the US, losers’ losses are outweighed by winners’ gains. 
Mankiw made that argument, but he failed to be understood. 
Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.) called for the resignation of N. Gregory Mankiw...” 
Of course, the Washington Post’s journalists know, on some level, that they were being unfair to Mankiw. 
They didn’t claim that what he said was inaccurate, or shortsighted, or analytically unsound. 
The descriptive terms they used – “discordant,” “embarrassing,” “political liability” – suggest that they knew they were giving Mankiw a raw deal. 
But was there any sign of the standard economic analysis of outsourcing in their stories? 
Not one. 
But the last thing the reporters wanted to do was to convey a thumbnail summary of Mankiw’s analysis of outsourcing. 
That’s simply not the business they saw themselves as being in. 
The problem is not that the Washington Post and papers like it hire people who are unintelligent or lazy. 
The problem is that conveying accurate information about the economy is far down the list of priorities for normal news reporters. 
Making a splash matters. 
So does keeping track of who is up politically and who is down. 
So does pleasing your editors so that they’ll give your stories better placement, and pleasing your sources so that they’ll keep talking to you. 
Compared to these imperatives, there is little to be gained from informing the public about how the economy really functions and about the dilemmas of economic policy. 
What can we do about this? 
The answer is simple, and it is a matter of demand, not supply. 
After all, few people go into journalism to deliberately mislead the public. 
The Tails Wagging the Kremlin Dog? 
MOSCOW – Imagine a crank who tries to pass himself off as a nineteenth-century Russian baron. 
He grows sideburns, wears a long frock-coat, and carries a walking stick. 
Anyone who runs into such a figure would sneer and mock him. 
Now, suppose that same crank attempted to treat passersby as if they were his serfs. 
According to this view, every great power needs obedient satellite countries. 
Under such an approach, NATO’s expansion is represented as an extension of America’s sphere of influence, to the detriment of Russia, of course. 
Moreover, the constitutions of a number of CSTO countries expressly prohibit sending troops outside national territory. 
The virtuoso of such manipulation is Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Belarus’s economy can function only if Russia subsidizes energy prices and allocates non-repayable credits. 
Yet, despite all this, Lukashenko manages to avoid implementing economic projects profitable to Russia (i.e., a single currency). 
Worse, whenever Moscow persists in its demands, Lukashenko abrogates agreements without a twinge of conscience. 
Lukashenko avoids any major integration projects, even those in the military sphere. 
The most telling example is the creation of a joint air defense system. 
Both Russia and Belarus have been trying to realize this project for ten years; countless agreements have been achieved – on paper. 
Yet no concrete action is taken. 
Lukashenko, simply, does not intend to allow even a small part of his army to become subordinated to Moscow. 
While the military threat in the West looks as illusory as it is, in Central Asia that threat is concrete. 
In the event that the coalition of NATO forces in Afghanistan is defeated, a wave of Islamic extremism will submerge the Central Asian states, inciting local civil wars. 
For Russia, this could mean (in the best case) tens of thousands of refugees or (in the worst case) the arrival of armed militias on its territory. 
As a result, the Kremlin has a vital interested in NATO’s success in Afghanistan. 
Yet, for the last four years, Russia has tried to hinder NATO in every possible way. 
Kremlin strategists explained that they feared the US would oust Russia from Central Asia. 
In February, the Kremlin gave Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev $500 million for a promise to close America’s base in his country. 
So the Kremlin paid out several hundred million dollars just to replace some signs. 
Bakiyev seems to have said: so, you are worried about the American military presence in Central Asia, and you want to confront it. 
Fine, the Americans can have one base in Kyrgyzstan, and Russia can have two. 
Seizure of a Russian military base in order to acquire weapons is, indeed, likely to become a vital goal of “extremists.” 
But, in a way, the Russian soldiers there are already hostages – not least to the Kremlin’s bankrupt foreign policy. 
The Talmud and Greek Debt 
BUENOS AIRES – There are two ways to look at Greece’s majestically unsustainable sovereign-debt mountain. 
And there is a “moral” perspective, which focuses on the nature of debt and on the long-term economic consequences of failing to honor it. 
Neither perspective is wrong; on the contrary, the problem is how to reconcile them. 
Indeed, failure to do so appears to explain why the official response to the Greek debt crisis has been so inadequate. 
An oft-quoted passage provides a fresh, if not exactly new, perspective on Greece’s debt and the best way to address it. 
The passage concerns sales, divorces, and offerings, and specifies that these acts are legally valid only if a person performs them voluntarily. 
Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, courts may force an individual until he says that he is, indeed, willing. 
The verse says, literally, “We (the court) force him until he says that he wants to do it willingly.” 
So, “in divorces (if the man refuses to grant it), we exercise force on him until he says ‘I want to do it voluntarily.’” 
Similarly, if a court forces a person to sell his property, the sale is valid because it is considered to have been carried out voluntarily. 
Understanding this apparent contradiction sheds light on the controversy surrounding the question of private bondholders’ involvement in the Greek rescue package. 
It is argued that, to avoid a default, private creditors should agree to shoulder part of the cost of the bailout. 
But how does one impose a financial loss on bondholders without it being classified by credit-rating agencies as a default? 
The prevailing answer is that one coerces bondholders to accept the deal “voluntarily.” 
One could dismiss this dispute as being mere rhetoric. 
There are two preponderant interpretations of the Talmudic passage. 
One argues that coercion can change minds. 
While technically correct, this is a ruthless interpretation, since this type of “willing” behavior is bound to leave resentment. 
A more benign interpretation, based on the collective-action principle, envisages the court as instrumental in attaining a superior welfare equilibrium. 
The court, according to this view, provides the coordinating mechanism, eliminating free riders and forcing all parties to an outcome that makes everybody better off. 
Thus, individual decisions, though extracted under pressure, become, when assessing the outcome, truly voluntary. 
In initiatives of this sort, agreement is obtained reluctantly and pressure could provoke harsh responses. 
Rating agencies are right in considering them a “selective” default that is bound to result in contagion – and, eventually, in widespread debt restructuring. 
The alternative is to seek a cooperative resolution, consistent with the benign interpretation of “forced willingness.” 
This can be achieved by adopting some features of the model used in Eastern Europe, known as the “Vienna Initiative.” 
Some of the current proposal to deal “voluntarily” with the Greek debt goes some way in this direction. 
But the initiative is insufficient, because the three pillars of the Vienna model are basically missing. 
The third component is the exercise of suasion on bondholders to achieve maximum participation, obtain binding pre-commitments, and eliminate free riders. 
Since this scheme would imply losses for bondholders, substantial official muscle and peer pressure is needed. 
Therefore, under this model – and despite the initial pressure – the behavior of bondholders could be considered truly voluntary. 
The Tea Party’s Modest Proposal 
WASHINGTON, DC – America’s Tea Party has a simple fiscal message: the United States is broke. 
This then produces the fervent belief that government spending must be cut radically, and now. 
Their historical antecedent is America’s anti-revenue Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, not the original anti-British, pro-representation Boston Tea Party in 1773. 
Most importantly, their tactics have proven massively destructive of wealth in the US. 
Since the prolonged showdown over the budget began earlier this year, the stock market has lost about 20% of its value (roughly $10 trillion). 
Part of the Tea Party’s founding myth, of course, is that smaller government will lead to faster growth and greater prosperity for all. 
And the tone of political debate, not surprisingly, has become much nastier. 
By signing a pledge not to raise taxes, Tea Party representatives have credibly committed themselves not to acquiesce in any middle-of-the-road compromise. 
If they break this pledge, presumably they will face defeat in the next round of Republican Party primaries. 
So, while a budget deal would technically be easy to achieve, it looks politically impossible in the near term. 
Its tactics thus appear politically sustainable, at least through the 2012 elections. 
Perhaps the most damaging outcome of these tactics is to take countercyclical fiscal policy off the table completely. 
Regardless of what happens to the global economy in the weeks and months ahead, it is inconceivable that any kind of meaningful fiscal stimulus would get through the House of Representatives. 
It remains to be seen whether the US Federal Reserve will also feel constrained by the political mood on Capitol Hill. 
The irony of the Tea Party revolt, of course, is that it undermines the private sector more than it reins in “big government.” 
It was the value of the stock market that fell sharply – which makes sense, given that counter-cyclical policy is now severely constrained. 
The government part of the credit system has been strengthened, relatively speaking, by developments over the past few months. 
It is the private sector – where investment and entrepreneurial activity are needed to generate growth and employment – that has taken a beating. 
Unless and until America’s private sector recovers, investment and job creation will continue to stagnate. 
But today’s atmosphere of fear and aggressive budget tactics are combining to undermine private-sector confidence and spending power. 
As Jonathan Swift put it in 1727, “Party is the madness of many, for the gain of the few.” 
The Terror Next Door. 
NEW DELHI – The fallout from the terror attacks in Mumbai last week has already shaken India. 
But what can India do? 
The terrorists hit multiple targets in Mumbai, both literally and figuratively. 
They dented the worldwide image of India as an emerging economic giant, a success story of the era of globalization and an increasing magnet for investors and tourists. Instead the world was made to see an insecure and vulnerable India, a “soft state” bedevilled by enemies who can strike it at will. 
That was not all. 
By singling out Americans, British and Israelis for their malign attention, the terrorists extended the global Islamist war against “Jews and crusaders” to new territory. 
In July this year, American intelligence sources publicly revealed that the suicide-bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul had been conducted at the behest of the ISI. 
This episode, along with two climbdowns by Pakistan’s government after public attempts to curb the ISI had been spurned by the Army, confirmed that the civilian government in Islamabad is too weak to challenge the all-powerful military. 
Anything that smacks of temporizing and appeasement will further inflame the public a few months before national elections are due. 
In the end India pulled back its deployment on the border. 
For this reason, the US is likely to press India not to contemplate forceful retaliation that could undermine America’s objectives in Afghanistan. 
Yet inaction is not an option. 
The governments of the victims of the Mumbai massacre are also likely to demand accountability from Islamabad. 
Pakistan is likely to face disagreeable diplomatic and economic consequences for inaction. 
Contemplating such options, the world may be forced to admit its impotence. 
The Third Way: an Epitaph 
The last half-century has seen the end of ideological politics in much of the world. 
First came the apocalyptic collapse of fascism as Hitler took Germany with him into a collective suicide. 
Fascism's demise was followed by the more gradual disintegration of communism after Stalin's death and Khrushchev's revelations of Stalin's crimes. 
The failed revolutions in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 foreshadowed the eventual failure of the Soviet empire in 1989. 
While these pseudo-religions collapsed, a benevolent ideology of social democracy dominated much of Europe. 
Not everyone subscribed to this theory, but it was the West's strongest political force for several decades. 
Christian Democrats, and even conservative parties, adopted its tenets. 
But by the early 1980's social democracy had exhausted itself. 
It had simply been too successful to remain a force for change. 
The reaction to this malaise came swiftly, and it had a name - well, two names: Ronald Reagan and, above all, Margaret Thatcher. 
Even the word "neo-liberal" exaggerates the intellectual coherence of this counter force. 
This change in political direction coincided with ­- indeed, was perhaps responsible for - the process that we now call globalization. 
Thatcherism plus globalization had many liberating consequences, but the combination also created new social problems, begetting losers as well as winners. 
The Thatcherite counter-revolution was so successful that it, too, began to incite countervailing pressures. 
Both were to be achieved within a liberal order. 
This is the main political project in most free societies, and it is in principle acceptable to all major parties. 
Yet some tried to turn it into a new ideological edifice. 
The new "Third Way" spreading from Washington to London to the rest of the world seemed to embody these leaders' own ideology. 
As it turned out, this episode was even shorter-lived than the conservative counter-revolution. 
Indeed, it was no more than an episode. 
At the same time, Blair found more sympathy for the Third Way with his Spanish conservative colleague José María Aznar than among many social democrats. 
The apparent hegemony of neo-social democrats began to crumble after only a few years. 
The Benelux countries, some Scandinavian states, and many of the new Europeans of East Central Europe have chosen traditionally right-of-centre parties. 
The German Chancellor and his "red-green" coalition still clings to power but is today severely weakened. 
Even Tony Blair is struggling to hold on. 
All this does not augur a new change of direction in Europe. 
Whoever governs must try to square this circle. 
The Third Way is A Rightwing Way 
This insight is particularly useful in Europe, and increasingly around the globe, when examining the actions of supposedly leftwing and socialist governments. 
In the late 1950s France came near to civil war over Algeria. 
Out of power since 1946, Charles de Gaulle was summoned back to the Elysée to lead France out of this quagmire. 
Because of his patriotism, de Gaulle seemed the only man able to set Algeria free. 
Economics is not immune from this dynamic. 
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher successfully promoted lower income taxes, privatization of government enterprises, weaker unions, and a generally smaller role for government. 
Often, only these parties have sufficient political support on the left to succeed in introducing needed reforms in labor and other markets. 
A telling example of this trend is found in Mexico’s economic policies of the 1980’s and 1990’s. 
So President Fox needs only to continue this revolution, not start his own. 
But it is recent policy changes in Germany and France that provide, perhaps, the most impressive examples of the "de Gaulle/Algeria" and "Nixon/China" theory of political reform. 
Conservative governments in these nations accomplished little in the way of serious market reform, despite considerable rhetoric. 
The Jospin and Schroeder governments were elected on manifestos that promised to cut unemployment and raise growth by expanding government regulation. 
Each regime did in fact start out by introducing more government controls - including a law to implement a 35 hour week in France. 
Both governments, however, soon -- and quite stealthily -- reversed course. 
Gerhard Schroeder in Germany has now slashed corporate taxes, is encouraging startup companies, and promises to provide tax breaks for private pension plans. 
French Premier Jospin quietly liberalized the French labor market by allowing for more part-time work, increased privatization, and promoted a more globally competitive financial system with reduced governmental control. 
In politics as in life, ideology is usually overwhelmed by self-interest. 
The Three Faces of Putin 
An obvious sign of this is the amount of time Putin spends on foreign trips with little diplomatic justification. 
Diplomacy, however, allows a president opportunity to enhance his authority for future domestic battles. 
The constraints Putin faces are not constitutional but are formed by the three factions that make up his government. 
The second consists of liberal economists and lawyers from Putin’s home town of St. Petersburg, with Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin and Minister of Economy German Gref the leading lights. 
Because of these three very visible fault lines, some Russians describe their country as having distinct security, economic, and political/business governments. 
The FSB people naturally focus on security, law, and order. 
The St. Petersburg liberals pursue market economic reforms. 
Kremlin policymaking is largely an interplay between these three factions. 
The institutional checks and balances built into Russia’s constitution have been neutralized. 
Rampant corruption has discredited regional governors as a counterweight. 
By slashing subsidies from regional budgets, federal revenues increased from 9% of GDP in 1998 to 17% of GDP this year. 
Not a surprise, then, that the governors cannot mobilize popular support as federal authorities impose accountability standards on them. 
The State Duma has also faded. 
Parliamentarians complain about “KGB threats,” but honesty doesn’t seem a lot to ask of Duma members. 
The real problem in policymaking is forging agreement between Putin’s three factions. 
Take the example of the Kursk disaster. 
The politics of the sunken submarine were handled by Sergei Ivanov. 
All three factions applaud the downfalls of media oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, but for different reasons. 
The FSB favors keeping the media under the Kremlin’s thumb. 
Abramovich, brought to the fore by Berezovsky, is eliminating his competitors. 
Liberals see Berezovsky and Gusinsky as the main practitioners of corruption and responsible for the demise of market reform in 1997. 
Thus, the outstanding issue is media freedom, with the FSB faction and the liberals opposing one another. 
Pension reform with private savings accounts and land reform leading to private ownership of land seem within reach. 
Prospects for economic reform have never been brighter than in 2000. 
The main problem is producing well-designed reforms backed by key officials. 
Here a big problem arises from the fact that industrial ministers continue to interfere because they represent business interests or are even in business themselves. 
Fortunately, his decision was reversed by the government after public uproar. 
In the coming year, Putin’s big test will be over control of gas monopoly Gazprom, now co-owned by its managers and the state. 
Its long-time CEO Rem Vyakhirev departs next May. 
Incredibly, Russia’s largest company - with one third of the world’s gas reserves - is unprofitable because of poor management and theft. 
Billions of dollars are siphoned off each year through companies allegedly controlled by Gazprom managers. 
Will Putin stand against them? 
A smaller drama concerns Russia’s railways. 
The outcome remains unclear. 
Beside Gazprom, the banking system is Russia’s economic black hole. 
No sensible person keeps money in a Russian bank. 
Here, the stumbling block is the old-style apparatchik Viktor Gerashchenko, Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, who thrives on the mess. 
Because he is not involved in the power struggle, and since banking reform is a huge task, nobody seems prepared to take him on. 
Daily, each of Putin’s three faces can be seen. 
The future of his presidency will depend on which two ever will join into a unified faction. 
The Three Mis-Represents 
It is two years since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unveiled its new ideological credo, called the "Three Represents." 
Good fortune, that is, for the CCP, not for China and its people. 
The "Three Represents" has several official versions, each including the words "always," "China," and "represent." 
Their meaning is clear. 
Common sense suggests that the "majority of the people," whom the CCP is supposed to "represent," should include workers. 
But the CCP long ago abandoned the workers. 
How many lost their jobs last month? 
How many were forced to take early retirement? 
How many mining accidents were there? 
How many workers' protests? 
Who jailed their organizers? 
The "Representative of the Three Represents" refuse to say. 
Workers who protest and strike are "rioting." Whoever reports such events is "anti-revolutionary." 
Peasants followed Mao because the CCP promised them land. 
But Mao decided to take back the land from the peasants even before it was given to them. 
"The serious problem is the education of the peasants," he said. 
So he taught them that all land belongs to the state. 
The "representatives" of the peasants are the new landlords. 
In a China without democracy, student sentiment is a key political barometer. 
Unlike workers or peasants, students include people from all levels of society, so whatever mobilizes them represents society's focus at that time. 
Those who defend the Party's bloody crackdown of those students have no right to call themselves the representatives of the majority of the people. 
Their claim to be "always representing the progressive direction of advanced culture" is yet another grand and empty declaration. 
Chinese culture stretches three thousand years into the past and perhaps thousands of years into the future. 
Is it to be "always represented" by a lone political party? 
Such obscurantism only creates a culture of stultifying uniformity. 
Like a blade of grass beneath a stone, culture knows how and in which direction to seek light. 
It does not need to be "represented." 
Of the three "represents," the clearest meaning is to be found in the CCP's vow to "always represent the demands of advanced productive forces." 
This means representing the interests of the da-kuan, those who suddenly became rich, usually through government connections. 
The phrase has no deeper meaning. 
The union of power and money in today's China originates from the steady inflation of bureaucracy. 
Before the Great Leap Forward, townships could barely afford a few full-time cadres. 
Today, each township has hundreds. 
Their basic salary is paid by the central government, but bonuses and extra benefits depend on contributions from the "advanced productive forces" at the county and township level. 
Even under less corrupt conditions, representing "the most advanced productive forces" is a flawed idea. 
What will become of several hundred million rural peasants and jobless workers in sunset industries? 
Who will address inequality and divergent social interests? 
But the theory of the Three Represents is nevertheless necessary, because a new situation has emerged. 
Fifty years later, socialism's advantages, Marxism's truth, and the proletarian character of the Party have all been unanswerably challenged. 
So the Three Represents is an effort to salvage one-party rule. 
You may doubt socialism, but you cannot doubt "advanced productive forces." 
You may not believe in Marxism, but you must believe in "advanced culture." 
The CCP no longer represents workers and peasants, but it can represent the "majority of the people," including "red" capitalists. 
Indeed, whether CCP members who have become "revolutionarily" wealthy remain "red" is determined solely by their acceptance of one-party rule. 
Welcoming "red capitalists" therefore does not imply democratization. 
Such people are more likely to seek to strengthen their privileges than promote pluralism and the rule of law. 
Totalitarianism, not political reform, is their livelihood. 
It is this, above all else, that the theory of the Three Represents comprehends. 
The Three Swedish Models 
Sweden’s economic and social system, sometimes called the “Swedish Model,” is often depicted either as an ideal or an abnormality. 
But Sweden’s system has varied considerably. 
In fact, broadly speaking there have been three different Swedish “models” since the late nineteenth century. 
The first model lasted from about 1870 until the 1960’s. 
During this “liberal” period, the government basically provided stable market-supporting legislation, education, health care, and infrastructure. 
During this century-long period, Sweden moved from being one of the poorest western countries to being the third richest country in terms of GDP per capita. 
In other words, Sweden became a rich country before its highly generous welfare-state arrangements were created. 
A second era lasted from 1960 until 1985. 
By the late 1980’s, total public spending reached 60-65% of GDP, compared to about 30% in 1960. 
Moreover, marginal tax rates hit 65-75% for most full-time employees, compared to about 40% in 1960 (all taxes on households being included). 
Moreover, new labor-market regulations were introduced, the most important being strict job-security legislation implemented in the early 1970’s. 
The regulation of financial markets that was imposed during WWII was retained. 
It is this economic and social system that is usually identified as the “Swedish model.” 
Although economic performance during this period was not dismal, it was certainly not impressive. 
Between 1970 and 1995, GDP per capita in Sweden lagged by about 18% behind the average of rich OECD countries. 
As a result, Sweden fell from third to approximately seventeenth place in the OECD in terms of GDP per capita. 
This can partly be explained by the “catch up” mechanism, as technologically less advanced countries imported technology from more advanced countries. 
In 1991, marginal tax rates were cut by 10-20% for large parts of the population. 
These reforms had broad political support and were, in fact, initiated during a social-democratic government. 
Subsequently, mainly during a period of center-right governance, several product markets were deregulated: telecommunications, electricity, road transport, taxis, and, to some extent, railways. 
One purpose of this was to increase competition and freedom of choice. 
The new center-right government elected in the fall of 2006 has committed itself to continuing economic liberalization. 
It has also abolished the wealth tax (after the previous social-democratic government had already abolished the inheritance tax). 
Moreover, the government has modestly reduced taxes on wages and slightly scaled down the generosity of some benefits. 
But there are two basic caveats. 
Clearly, some of these policy measures may conflict with traditional egalitarianism in Sweden, at least in the short term. 
Hence, the big question underlying the current wave of liberalization is whether these reform tendencies are politically sustainable. 
The next general election in 2010 will give part of the answer. 
The Three Trillion Dollar War 
NEW YORK – With March 20 marking the fifth anniversary of the United States-led invasion of Iraq, it’s time to take stock of what has happened. 
This is not surprising. 
After all, the Bush administration lied about everything else, from Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction to his supposed link with al-Qaeda. 
Indeed, only after the US-led invasion did Iraq become a breeding ground for terrorists. 
The Bush administration said the war would cost $50 billion. 
The US now spends that amount in Iraq every three months. 
Moreover, the Bush administration cut taxes for the rich as it went to war, despite running a budget deficit. 
As a result, it has had to use deficit spending – much of it financed from abroad –to pay for the war. 
Was this incompetence or dishonesty? 
Almost surely both. 
Only years after the war began did the administration order the specially armored vehicles that would have saved the lives of many killed by roadside bombs. 
The administration has tried to keep the war’s costs from the American public. 
Veterans groups have used the Freedom of Information Act to discover the total number of injured – 15 times the number of fatalities. 
Already, 52,000 returning veterans have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. 
America will need to provide disability compensation to an estimated 40% of the 1.65 million troops that have already been deployed. 
Ideology and profiteering have also played a role in driving up the war’s costs. 
America has relied on private contractors, which have not come cheap. 
A Blackwater Security guard can cost more than $1,000 per day, not including disability and life insurance, which is paid for by the government. 
The war has had only two winners: oil companies and defense contractors. 
The stock price of Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney’s old company, has soared. 
But even as the government turned increasingly to contractors, it reduced its oversight. 
The largest cost of this mismanaged war has been borne by Iraq. 
Half of Iraq’s doctors have been killed or have left the country, unemployment stands at 25%, and, five years after the war’s start, Baghdad still has less than eight hours of electricity a day. 
Out of Iraq’s total population of around 28 million, four million are displaced and two million have fled the country. 
With so many people in Iraq suffering so much in so many ways, it may seem callous to discuss the economic costs. 
And it may seem particularly self-absorbed to focus on the economic costs to America, which embarked on this war in violation of international law. 
But the economic costs are enormous, and they go well beyond budgetary outlays. 
Next month, I will explain how the war has contributed to America’s current economic woes. 
Americans like to say that there is no such thing as a free lunch. 
Nor is there such a thing as a free war. 
The US – and the world – will be paying the price for decades to come. 
The Time is Now to Fight Disease 
But this can only happen with considerable investment. 
Now. Otherwise, today’s grim picture will only get worse. 
Each day, these diseases kill 16,000 people—devastating entire communities and plummeting countries deeper into poverty. 
Upping the ante could turn the tables. 
There are new ways of directing aid to where it is most needed. 
A key instrument is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. 
Created in 2002 as a partnership between governments and civil society, the Global Fund is unique in the way it aims to deliver assistance. 
Driven by real needs on the ground, projects are designed and implemented by recipients, and its procedures and operations are transparent. 
Of late there has been much talk about intensifying efforts to eradicate poverty. 
Building on this momentum, the campaigns for debt relief, trade reform, and increasing aid to poor countries have gained traction. 
Yet, while pledges to increase development assistance have soared, short-term funding is woefully inadequate. 
Any strategy for raising living standards must include urgent measures that address AIDS, TB and malaria. 
Stemming the spread of this deadly trio of diseases is the linchpin in the global fight against poverty. 
Unchecked, these diseases not only sap the strength of national economies, but jeopardize peace and security. 
Teachers and nurses are dying; police and security forces are being hard hit, and 14 million children have already been orphaned by AIDS. 
This failure will make remote any hope of reaching the other Millennium goals in the fight against poverty. 
A comprehensive response to AIDS, TB and malaria is needed. 
Acting now means less spending in the long run. 
Despite the scope of its mission, it has a minimal bureaucracy, which allows for a flexible response to changing needs. 
The Global Fund is not perfect; as with all new organizations, it is experiencing growing pains. 
If the Fund is to live up to its potential it will need $2.3 billion to continue its work effectively in 2005. 
They now have a chance to make good on their word. 
With many battles ahead in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria, it would be a disgrace if this opportunity is squandered. 
The Tobin Tax Lives Again 
The official in question was Adair Turner, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, the country’s chief financial regulator. 
Tobin was concerned about excessive fluctuations in exchange rates. 
It has also been endorsed by some French (predictably!) and other continental European leaders. 
The beauty of a Tobin tax is that it would discourage short-term speculation without having much adverse effect on long-term international investment decisions. 
Consider, for example, a tax of 0.25% applied to all cross-border financial transactions. 
Economic activity of this kind is of doubtful social value, yet it eats up real resources in terms of human talent, computing power, and debt. 
So we should not mourn the demise of such trading practices. 
Nor would a Tobin tax stand in the way of financial markets punishing governments that grossly mismanage their economies. 
Moreover, it is undeniable that such a tax would raise a great deal of money. 
Revenue estimates for a small tax on international currency transactions run into hundreds of billions of dollars per year. 
The receipts would be even greater if the base is extended, as was implied by Turner, to all global financial transactions. 
It would threaten the role of London as a financial center, some complained, as if the proposal was meant to apply just in London and not globally. 
That would be quite an incentive for self-monitoring. 
What the Tobin tax does not do is help with longer-term misalignments in financial markets. 
Such a tax would not have prevented the US-China trade imbalance. 
Neither would it have stopped the global saving glut from turning into a ticking time bomb for the world economy. 
It would not have protected European and other nations from becoming awash in toxic mortgage assets exported from the US. 
And it would not dissuade governments intent on pursuing unsustainable monetary and fiscal policies financed by external borrowing. 
For all of these problems we will need other macroeconomic and financial remedies. 
But a Tobin tax is a good place to start if we want to send a strong message about the social value of the casino known as global finance. 
The Too-Quiet American 
But the problem is not Punke. 
America’s rejectionist stance comes from the top of the US government, starting with President Barack Obama’s lack of leadership. 
From the outset of his presidency, Obama’s defense of a liberal trade regime has been inadequate. 
He has said repeatedly that exports are good for the US: they create jobs. 
But US exports are other nations’ imports, so Obama’s argument amounts to telling others to lose their jobs. 
Yet there is little in the opposition by fearful unions and greedy business lobbies that Obama could not beat back with compelling arguments. 
Besides, as the respected polling analyst Karlyn Bowman recently demonstrated, the US public is by no means strongly opposed to trade. 
This is partly because, in virtually every state, so many jobs today – and not just at UPS – depend on trade. 
Protectionism may, in fact, be an electoral dinosaur. 
In any event, history’s great statesmen have always earned their spurs by bucking the political odds for a matter of principle. 
If Obama actually wrote less and read more, he would find at least two historical episodes of courageous leadership on trade that are worthy of his admiration and emulation. 
One is the repeal of England’s Corn Laws by Prime Minister Robert Peel in 1848. 
He carried the day, but he lost the support of his party. 
As Lord Ashley observed in his diary: “[Peel] led the Tories and followed the Whigs.” 
The other example is Winston Churchill, who was elected as a Conservative member of Parliament from the northern industrial town of Oldham. 
After converting to free trade in 1904, he had to leave the party. 
He then joined the Liberal Party, accepting the invitation of the Liberal Association of Northwest Manchester. 
The Ethics of Big Food 
In many cases, the biggest food companies themselves do not know how they perform on these issues, betraying a profound lack of ethical responsibility on their part. 
Nestlé scored highest on transparency, as they provide information on at least some of their commodity sources and audit systems. 
But even its rating is only “fair.” 
General Mills was at the bottom of the ranking. 
In addition to this lack of transparency, Oxfam’s report identifies several deficiencies common to all of the Big 10 food companies. 
The Big 10 are also not taking sufficient responsibility to ensure that their larger-scale farm suppliers pay a decent living wage to their workers. 
There are 450 million wage workers in agriculture worldwide, and in many countries they are often inadequately paid, with 60% living in poverty. 
Some of the Big 10 are doing more than others to develop ethical policies in these areas. 
Unilever has committed itself to sourcing more raw materials from small-scale farmers, and has pledged 100% sustainable sourcing for all of its main commodities by 2020. 
This policy gave Unilever the highest score on openness to small farmers, with a rating of “fair.” 
Danone, General Mills, and Kellogg’s were at the bottom, with a rating of “very poor.” 
In 2011, the company used the Fair Labor Association to assess its supply chain. 
The assessment confirmed that many of Nestlé’s suppliers were using child and forced labor, and the company has now begun to address the problem. 
As a result, Nestlé, along with Unilever and Coca-Cola, scored “fair” on workers’ rights. 
None of the Big 10 did better. 
Kellogg’s received the lowest score in this category. 
Clearing tropical forests for grazing or palm-oil production releases large quantities of stored carbon into the atmosphere. 
Grazing ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, also contribute significantly to climate change. 
Nestlé was the only company to achieve a “fair” rating, with Associated British Foods at the bottom, with a “very poor” rating. 
Anyone with Internet access can visit Oxfam’s Web site and see how the big brands rank on each of seven ethically significant indicators. 
The highest scores currently are in the “fair” range, with not a single Big 10 company receiving a “good” rating in any category. 
The changes that have already occurred show that if big corporations know that their consumers want them to act more ethically, they will do so. 
The Torturers of Tashkent 
Sometimes the police are overzealous. 
Sometimes the victims die. 
Sometimes the regime tries to cover up the killings. 
But Karimov has never condemned torture, and he has instituted no measures to prevent it. 
A few cases make it to the public eye, but only when things go too far and victims of brutality or torture die. 
They then transported Tuychiyev to a police station in Angren, 100 kilometers south of the capital. 
By the next morning, Tuychiyev was dead. 
Four police officers are on trial for his killing. 
His parents say higher-ranking officers are going free. 
Talib Yakubov, a human-rights advocate in Uzbekistan, says that torture is an integral part of the Karimov regime’s domestic policy. 
Torture, Yakubov says, enables the government to keep the public in fear and submission. 
The government uses the threat of terrorist attacks to justify domestic repression of political opponents and the absence of democratic reforms. 
But, according to Yakubov, “Only thanks to torture, hundreds and thousands of people admit that they are guilty of religious extremism and terrorism. 
Without torture, none of them would have incriminated themselves.” 
In 2003, the international community tried to persuade Karimov to publicly denounce torture before an annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). 
Two months prior to the gathering, a United Nations special reporter published a paper condemning Uzbekistan for “widespread and systematic” use of torture. 
The report unleashed a wave of criticism of the EBRD for choosing to hold its meeting in Tashkent. 
In response, the EBRD promised to pressure Karimov to condemn torture. 
Karimov, not surprisingly, dodged and weaved instead. 
Thereafter, torture in Uzbekistan became routine. 
No one has managed to speak to a victim of torture in Uzbekistan. 
Dozens have died as a result of their ordeals. 
Most survivors languish in prison. 
Those who have been released prefer to keep silent about their experiences. 
(Psychological research shows that torture causes serious psychological trauma to its victims, whose families often suffer negative consequences as well.) 
I had a chance to see one of the victims of Uzbekistan’s regime. 
Rasul Haitov was 27 years old when he was detained in Tashkent with his brother Ravshan, 32, in October 2001. 
Police officers resorted to torture to get them to admit that they were members of an Islamist party, Hizb-ut Tahrir. 
The police choked the brothers with plastic bags. 
They drove needles under their fingernails, and then tore them out. 
They sodomized them with glass bottles, beat them up with clubs, and threw their bodies around a room. 
Ravshan died. 
Rasul barely survived. 
When I saw him in a courtroom, he was weak and feeble and looked like a broken old man. 
After two months of treatment, he could still not sit upright. 
The Trade-and-Aid Myth 
Trade and aid have become international buzzwords. 
Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but howmuch to do, and how fast. 
Lost in all this are the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development. 
Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves. 
Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts. 
Aid and market access have rarely played a critical role. 
Consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor, which also happens to be the world’s most powerful economy. 
Moreover, the country’s banking system is supported by its rich neighbor’s demonstrated willingness to act as a lender of last resort. 
Globalization does not get much better than this, right? 
Now consider a second country. 
As the reader may have guessed, these are real countries: Mexico and Vietnam. 
Vietnam still remains outside the WTO. 
Now consider their economic performance. 
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell. 
What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country’s economic fortunes. 
What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy. 
With none of Mexico’s advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers. 
Broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most. 
Taiwan did not receive foreign aid or preferential market access. 
China and India, today’s two economic superstars, have prospered largely through sui generis reform efforts. 
Obviously, both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets. 
Witness the mess that other countries made of their natural-resource endowments. 
The word “diamond” hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone. 
Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius. 
None of this absolves rich countries of their responsibility to help. 
They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators – for example, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign. 
Development should focus not on trade and aid, but on improving the policy environment in poor countries. 
The Tragedy of President Chen 
Taiwan’s Public Prosecutor has indicted the wife of President Chen Shui-bien for embezzling public funds. 
Chen, as a sitting president, cannot be indicted even though the prosecutor says that he has evidence to prove his guilt. 
But Chen’s legacy was already in tatters. 
The root of Chen’s moral demise is something the classical Greeks identified: hubris. 
Chen once had political courage. 
The world has largely deserted Taiwan and its 23 million people – the only democracy among 1.2 billion Chinese. 
But Chen’s behavior did not help. 
For years, forward looking Taiwanese industrialists, including many hi-tech entrepreneurs, urged Chen to de-bureaucratize and de-politicize Taiwan’s increasingly isolated economy. 
Failing to persuade him, they decamped to mainland China. 
As a result, big international corporations and Wall Street banks now flock to China, bypassing Taiwan. 
Taiwan’s missed opportunity reflects its government’s sheer incompetence, arrogance, and ignorance. 
Indeed, Chen even argued that the Taiwanese were never Chinese. 
Chen should have celebrated Taiwan’s “Chineseness” proudly and loudly, thereby distinguishing the island from the barbaric legacy of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Chen’s record suggests he will hang on to his failed presidency. 
He will use his legal training to fight on technicalities. 
But to the rest of the world, Chen has been revealed as a petty liar over a pitiful amount of money. 
He and his wife lied about their involvement. 
Their close aides have confessed that they forged documents and perjured themselves to protect their political boss. 
What a pathetic ending for a man who could have become one of the most important leaders in modern Chinese history. 
The Tragedy of Zidane 
Those who the gods may destroy, they grant their wishes. 
Zinedine Zidane may be pondering that bit of ancient Greek wisdom today. 
Having announced that he would end his professional career with the World Cup, Zidane had his wish fulfilled. 
After France barely survived the tournament’s first round, Zidane performed at the top of his game and led the team to the brink of a second World Cup championship. 
There have been few such tragic moments in football history. 
His human qualities, as much as his talent and technical feats on the field, counted equally in establishing his popular acclaim. 
Football has always been this way. 
For Argentineans, the diminutive Diego Maradona represented the revenge of the weak and the deprived. 
As a result, his countrymen excused his frequent bad behavior time and again. 
Similarly, Pelé became the symbol of a harmonious, inter-racial Brazil. 
Zidane offered neither of these romantic images. 
After all, Zidane, arguably the world’s best football player, left with a gesture that has no place in any game. 
Nevertheless, Zidane will remain a global icon, owing to his profoundly human character and his extreme simplicity. 
Moreover, Zidane incarnated values that seem threatened nowadays, but to which ordinary people remain attached: loyalty to family, diligence, and cooperation. 
Here is a man who was not only a world champion, but also a model son and father. 
For this, Zidane was not only admired, but also respected. 
His success was never to the detriment of others. 
On the contrary, he is active in causes such as helping sick children. 
But now the hero has fallen. 
Zidane was not Superman, but a human being. 
In a single instant of unfathomable fury, his moment of glory was transformed into one of madness and a curse. 
His tragedy is ultimately a personal one. 
The Tragic Cost of Being Unscientific 
Instead, he embraced the views of a small group of dissident scientists who suggested other causes for AIDS. 
Mbeki stubbornly continued to embrace this position even as the evidence against it became overwhelming. 
While Botswana and Namibia, South Africa’s neighbors, provided anti-retrovirals to the majority of its citizens infected by HIV, South Africa under Mbeki failed to do so. 
A team of Harvard University researchers has now investigated the consequences of this policy. 
One of the key incidents in turning world opinion against South Africa’s apartheid regime was the 1961 Sharpeville massacre, in which police fired on a crowd of black protesters, killing 69 and wounding many more. 
Yet the Harvard study shows that he is responsible for the deaths of 5,000 times as many black South Africans as the white South African police who fired on the crowd at Sharpeville. 
How are we to assess a man like that? 
In Mbeki’s defense, it can be said that he did not intend to kill anyone. 
He appears to have genuinely believed – and perhaps still believes – that anti-retrovirals are toxic. 
He had no desire to harm them, and for that reason, we should judge his character differently from those who do set out to harm others, whether from hatred or to further their own interests. 
When Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, South Africa’s leading black immunologist, warned that the president’s policies would make South Africa a laughingstock in the world of science, Mbeki’s office accused him of defending racist Western ideas. 
Since Mbeki’s ouster in September, the new South African government of Kgalema Motlanthe has moved quickly to implement effective measures against AIDS. 
Mbeki’s health minister, who notoriously suggested that AIDS could be cured by the use of garlic, lemon juice, and beetroot, was promptly fired. 
The tragedy is that the African National Congress, South Africa’s dominant political party, was so much in thrall to Mbeki that he was not deposed many years ago. 
The lessons of this story are applicable wherever science is ignored in the formulation of public policy. 
This does not mean that a majority of scientists is always right. 
The history of science clearly shows the contrary. 
Scientists are human and can be mistaken. 
Mbeki must have known that, if his unorthodox views about the cause of AIDS and the efficacy of anti-retrovirals were wrong, his policy would lead to a large number of unnecessary deaths. 
That knowledge put him under the strongest obligation to allow all the evidence to be fairly presented and examined without fear or favor. 
Whether we are individuals, corporate heads, or government leaders, there are many areas in which we cannot know what we ought to do without assessing a body of scientific evidence. 
The Transatlantic Blame Game 
Indeed, the differences between the two sides' economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades. 
At first glance, the depth of this ``policy gap'' seems surprising. 
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 has improved recently both in the US and Europe. 
Moreover, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: encouraging economic recovery. 
When the Euro was introduced, most EU members--Germany, in particular--looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure. 
But the perception of many American observers was different. 
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America. 
These two views were bound to conflict, and now they do. 
As big budget deficits returned, so did European skepticism about the sustainability of America's mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar. 
Initially, the Europeans underestimated the slowdown they confronted. 
Both monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth, but Europe did not help much to redress America's external imbalance. 
Of course, the Euro area is so large a player that it can no longer leave responsibility for stimulating global growth to America. 
A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the largest benefits upon the most affluent, whose spending is less sensitive to taxes. 
Although the dollar has been depreciating for a year, continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5% of GDP. 
As the deficit widens further, dollar depreciation will likely resume, despite laggardly performances by the world's other major economies. 
Will the US accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004, and could Europe make a greater contribution to global growth? 
Probably not. 
So the US is likely to opt for growth. 
Despite three years of weak growth, the gap between potential and actual output in Continental Europe's largest economies is currently smaller than in the US. 
Income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable, given high rates in Europe's largest economies. 
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management, not inflation. 
The divergence in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in both Europe and the US for the next year or so. 
But the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation, potentially as divisive as the disputes over the Iraq war. 
If so, the ongoing Doha Round of international trade negotiations could be first to suffer. 
Protectionism will be harder to resist on both sides of the Atlantic. 
It strains the imagination to think that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly. 
The Transatlantic Free-Trade Imperative 
Today’s three-tier global economy – 6% growth in emerging markets, 2% growth in the US, and no growth in Europe – shows ominous signs of paralysis and nationalistic unilateralism. 
Although both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have actively intervened to boost economic recovery, the results could not be more different. 
In the US, the banking crisis was tackled rapidly and in a sustainable manner, while Europe is still going from one bailout to the next. 
Moreover, America’s stimulus program obviously worked (notwithstanding criticism from the left for being too small, and attacks from the right for being too large). 
The more America and the EU grow together, the more the EU will benefit from the US recovery. 
Demand for European goods will increase, and the EU’s member states can – and should – align their economies with US growth. 
History suggests that the hope for a self-sustained recovery in Europe might well prove deceptive; almost always, the European economic cycle has followed and reinforced that of the US. 
Today, for example, a prolonged recession in Europe is, alongside budget cuts, generally seen as posing the greatest risk to a sustained US recovery. 
Labor costs in the US industrial sector are currently 25% lower than the European average. 
This has led energy-intensive European industries – including producers of glass, steel, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals – to invest heavily in the US. 
Often, they manufacture high-quality upstream products, which are then processed further in Europe. 
The Austrian steel producer Voestalpine AG, for example, will start producing steel pellets in the southern US that will then be upgraded to high-quality alloys in Austria. 
The combination of lower production costs in the US and Europe’s world-class finishing capabilities is a recipe for first-rate products at competitive prices. 
In this way, European investment is contributing to the re-industrialization of the US while simultaneously ensuring high-quality European jobs. 
But Europe must do more to reinvigorate its own manufacturing sector. 
The last attempt to create an EU-US free-trade zone, under President Bill Clinton, failed because of the EU’s rigid, antiquated agricultural policy. 
A new effort would help Europe to replace its agricultural policy with a research-and-development policy aimed at boosting industrial competitiveness. 
The increasing economic weight of Asia is also a geopolitical game-changer. 
China’s massive arms build-up shows that economic power without military power is only a temporary phenomenon. 
So the focus in world politics is shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific. 
Europe should know where it belongs. 
In his second inaugural address, President Barack Obama called an EU-US free-trade zone a core project of his second term. 
Secretary of State John Kerry repeated this during his visit to Germany this spring. 
Now it is up to export-oriented EU countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Austria to press for action on the American offer of negotiations. 
Europe has engaged in navel-gazing for long enough. 
Its malaise has raised questions about whether its democratic capitalism will survive the economic challenge posed by authoritarian and quasi-authoritarian regimes. 
I, for one, prefer making political decisions to wallowing in doubt and self-pity. 
A transatlantic trade pact would align both economies with the fundamental interests of the West. 
The Transatlantic Index 
How should we assess the state of transatlantic relations nowadays? 
With a nod to Wall Street, we can say that the Alliance is up, Europe is flat, and the United States is clearly down. 
For the first time since Charles de Gaulle established the Fifth Republic, France’s priority is no longer to live in opposition to the US. 
The signs of this shift are profound, even spectacular. 
France’s shift is the result of both political calculus and deeply felt emotion. 
For Sarkozy, the French are not anti-Americans, but simply anti-Bush. 
He is the son of immigrants, the outsider whose rise to the top is living proof of French openness. 
In the US, too, the attitude towards the alliance with Europe has changed mightily. 
America needs allies, and is not preoccupied by their potential independent strength. 
But rapprochement between France and the US should not hide other realities. 
First, in Afghanistan, NATO is in danger of suffering its first military defeat. 
Where will the new troops that are needed come from? 
And a key member of the Alliance, Turkey, may be about to embark in a dangerous military adventure in Kurdish northern Iraq. 
If Europe is “flat,” one reason is Sarkozy. 
He may be encouraging news for the Alliance, his European policy is a source of worry for Europe. 
While Sarkozy claims that Europe is his priority, his methods seem to contradict his intentions. 
One cannot simultaneously defend the Alliance in the name of Europe and weaken Europe with fits of populism and economic nationalism. 
Their links with Europe – if they exist at all – are at best rational, not emotional. 
But will cool rationality be enough to create a European security pillar within the context of the Alliance? 
As for America, it is “down” in terms of both “soft” ideological power and “hard” military power. 
Today, Americans and Europeans alike must demonstrate modesty. 
In this new context, solidarity is as crucial as ever. 
Opinion about the US remains largely negative in Europe, and will remain so at least until the US presidential election in 2008. 
Likewise, US perceptions of France and of Europe are only slowly improving. 
It is only by respecting our common values and not exacerbating our differences that the West will be able to reinvent itself. 
The Alliance may be “up,” but its outlook remains uncertain. 
The Transatlantic Muslim Divide 
Compared with the tension that exists in Muslim communities across Europe, America’s Muslims are a more contented lot. 
Both income and college graduation levels match the national norms. 
63% of American Muslims report no conflict between religious devotion and living in modern society. 
Indeed, 73% said they had never experienced discrimination while living in America. 
Moreover, 85% said suicide bombing is rarely or never justified, and only 1% said violence to defend Islam was “often” permissible. 
In Europe, significantly higher percentages of Muslims believe that suicide bombings are “often” or “sometimes” justified. 
America’s Muslims do not so much assimilate as participate in economic, political, educational, and social life. 
It can be argued that only those poor eager for the harsh but open possibilities of American life immigrate to the US. 
Yet this doesn’t explain why these poorer immigrants remain religious; wanting to succeed US-style, they should want to be quick to “assimilate.” 
Why do US Muslims do well while remaining devout and distinctive-looking? 
Why can they participate without assimilating? 
Despite the discrimination and poverty that immigrants often suffer initially, barriers to economic and political participation are relatively low. 
The US is not a secular society; it is a religiously pluralistic one with secular legal and political structures. 
Indeed, America’s secular institutions were designed to support pluralism. 
They allow people of many creeds to work in them—a workplace of multiple faiths. 
The prohibition against a state religion together with freedom of conscience preserves the plurality of religion in civil life. 
Freedom to practice one’s religion was an advertisement for America. 
On the other hand, they can get in. 
And they can keep not only their private faith but practice it publicly. 
Tolerance for other people’s religion is the price paid for tolerance of one’s own. 
Prejudice has tended to fall as participation increases. It has been in no one’s interest to disturb this live-and let-live pragmatism for very long. 
Americans, indeed, are familiar with difference, or at least they tend not to panic. 
Even after 2001, there were only a few anti-Muslim incidents. 
Europe, however, demands greater assimilation and offers a less porous economy and politics. 
This means less participation and thus less familiarity with difference on the host country’s side. 
This is Europe’s headscarf debate in a nutshell. 
It speaks to none of the barriers to participation or to immigrant responses to them, but demands symbolic assimilation. 
But such demands are a dead end. 
To get out of it, greater entry into the economy and politics is needed, but also less demand for quick-fix assimilation. 
Both fundamentalism and the demands of assimilation — be like us, now! — pre-empt these mechanisms. 
They should be allowed to work. 
But Europe demands assimilation before participation in an economy that immigrants can’t get into anyway. 
This, sadly, is a road to the ghetto. 
The New Obama 
To my eye, however, the old Obama was not back. 
A new Obama had appeared. 
The old Obama was youthful, charming, graceful, and full of hope. 
His demeanor was crisp yet easy-going. 
His rhetoric soared. 
His smile could light up a stadium. 
The Obama on display in the second debate – and the third – was harder, chillier, sadder, and more somber. 
There was tension in the lines of his mouth. 
His speech was clipped, as if under continuous rigorous control. 
His rhetoric did not soar, could not soar. 
The smile was rare and constrained. 
But his command of detail and argument was rock solid. 
His sentences parsed. 
He spoke with a cold, disciplined energy. 
One word for all of this would be “presidential,” in the sense of competent, seasoned, and sobered by reality. 
Obama has inhabited the White House for four years; now the White House inhabits him. 
Each time, his performance was flat. 
The truth appears to be that his muse deserted him sometime in the first year of his presidency. 
The result was a simulacrum of the old Obama, as if he were acting the part of himself. 
Then, in the first debate, no such futile effort was even made, and there was no Obama at all, neither old nor new. 
As so many commentators noted, in some sense he simply failed to show up. 
Has the presidency hardened Obama? 
Has it brutalized him? 
There are reasons for thinking that it has. 
First, Obama has taken, perhaps, a heavier beating from his political opposition than most presidents. 
The theme of Obama’s life, clearly expressed in his eloquent memoir Dreams from My Father, and shown in the recent Frontline documentary The Choice, is reconciliation. 
He is not a man whose identity was handed to him by birth. 
He found it in the idea of reconciliation – both racial and ideological. 
It was to be the theme of his presidency. 
The dreams from his father were at an end, and he was left, as he only slowly realized, with the themeless pragmatism that has become the hallmark of his administration. 
All this, too, stood behind the performance of the man on stage during the second two debates. 
And if he is elected, it is this man who will govern. 
The Obama of 2008 is not back. 
He is not coming back. 
The Transition to Sustainability 
These investments are needed in the short term to offset the decline in worldwide consumption spending that underlies the global recession. 
In practice, the global crisis means that sustainable investments are being curtailed rather than expanded in the developing world. 
In fact, every part of the world has a huge backlog of vital infrastructure investments. 
It is time for a concerted global effort to bring those projects on line. 
This is not easy to do. 
Most infrastructure investment requires public-sector leadership to forge partnerships with the private sector. 
Such charges are likely to be hurled at governments even when they are not true, though all too often they are. 
Still, the backlog of such projects is now wreaking havoc with the world economy. 
The world’s major cities are clogged with traffic jams and pollution. 
The atmosphere is filling with greenhouse gases from heavy use of fossil fuels. 
Governments should thus strengthen their ministries of infrastructure (including power, roads, water and sanitation, and information and communication technologies), as well as their national development banks, so that they can properly design long-term infrastructure projects and programs. 
The ability to offset the crisis in a constructive manner through expanded public-private partnerships will determine the subsequent success of countries and regions. 
Interestingly, the US is about to create a National Infrastructure Bank for the first time. 
Nevertheless, American and European economic advisers generally believe that a short sharp stimulus will be enough to restore economic growth. 
This is wrong. 
What will be needed is an overhaul of the world economy towards sustainability. 
Moreover, policymakers in the rich world believe that they can continue to neglect the developing world, or leave it to its fate in global markets. 
This is also a recipe for global failure, and even future conflict. 
Whereas most of the “stimulus” legislation to date has been short-term and inward-looking, increased funding for sustainable infrastructure in poor countries would provide a powerful boost to rich-world economies. 
It can also be done multilaterally, by raising the infrastructure investment flows from the World Bank and the regional development banks (including the Inter-American Development Bank, European Investment Bank, African Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank). 
In almost all of the rich-country proposals about targets, limits, commitments, and permits for greenhouse gases, there is hardly a word about helping poor countries to finance the transition to sustainable technologies. 
The G-20 meeting in London on April 2 offers hope for a true global effort to repair the failing world economy. 
This is the time and place to launch the global drive toward sustainability. 
The Treason of the Economists 
LONDON – All epoch-defining events are the result of conjunctures – the correlation of normally unconnected events that jolt humanity out of a rut. 
Such conjunctures create what the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls “Black Swans” – unpredictable events with a vast impact. 
A small number of Black Swans, Taleb believes, “explain almost everything in our world.” 
Now consider recent financial innovations. 
On the back of the new computer and telecommunications technology, a giant market for derivative instruments was built. 
Before securitization, banks typically held mortgages; now they could get them off their books. 
But securitized credit taken off one bank’s balance sheet usually ended up on another bank’s books. 
Because all the derivatives were based on the same assets, if anything happened to those assets, all the banks holding the debt would find themselves in the same soup. 
What made the spread of derivatives possible was the ease with which the volume of debt for a given set of real assets could be expanded. 
This scalability was magnified by the use of credit default swaps (CDSs), which offered phony insurance against default. 
Since an unlimited number of CDSs could be sold against each borrower, the supply of swaps could grow much faster than the supply of bonds. 
CDSs magnified the size of the bubble by hugely speeding up the velocity of monetary circulation. 
CDSs were the means by which derivatives found their way into the portfolios of banks all over the world. 
This East Asian “savings glut” enabled a debt-fuelled consumption glut in the US, Britain, and much of the Western world. 
But the marriage between Chinese savings and American consumption had a fatal flaw: it created non-repayable debts. 
Chinese investments increasingly took the form of official purchases of US Treasury bills. 
These investments did not create new resources to provide the means of repayment. 
For the counterpart of the US debt build-up was the relocation of much American manufacturing capacity to China. 
Chinese savings flowed not into creating new assets, but into financial speculation and consumer binges. 
This interpretation of the origins of the present slump is disputed by the ‘money glut’ school. 
In their view, there was one cause, and one cause only of the crisis: the excessive credit creation that took place when Alan Greenspan was chairman of the US Federal Reserve. 
This view draws on the ‘Austrian’ theory of booms and slumps, and also Milton Friedman’s explanation of the Great Depression of 1929. 
It was wrong then, and it is wrong now. 
This line of reasoning assumes that markets are perfectly efficient. 
This view is also self-contradictory, for if market participants are perfectly rational and perfectly informed, they would not have been fooled by a policy of making money cheaper than it really was. 
Greenspan is the sacrifice they offer to the god of the market. 
It led directly to the spread of financial risk-management models, which, by excluding the possibility of default, grossly underestimated the amount of risk in the system. 
If we are going pursue the blame game, I blame economists more than bankers for the crisis. 
They established the system of ideas that bankers, politicians, and regulators applied. 
John Maynard Keynes wrote that “practical men who believe themselves to be quite immune from intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” 
Most of today’s crop of economists are not defunct, but continue to work in the ideological vicinity of Chicago. 
The Treason of the Magistrates 
PARIS – In democracies, justice is supposed to be independent. 
Some prosecutors and investigating magistrates, however, conveniently forget this. 
Indeed many among them are deeply enmeshed in politics, pursuing agendas – and vendettas – of their own. 
But the LDP worked hand in glove with Japan’s deeply entrenched bureaucracy, of which the prosecutors are a part. 
The DPJ has vowed to shake up the cozy relations between Japan’s bureaucrats, politicians, and big business. 
By indicting people close to Ozawa, the prosecutors appear to be acting in defense of the status quo . 
In Italy, prosecutors in Rome, following the lead of their colleagues in Milan, are now going after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
Italy’s investigating magistrates have consistently refused to accept the popularity and electoral power of a business tycoon whom they have tried to convict for many years. 
Berlusconi may not be the most refined of Italians, but after many trials it has never been proven that he committed any crime. 
Yet magistrates continue to haul him into court. 
In France, Paris magistrates attempted for years to indict former President Jacques Chirac on charges of corruption. 
So long as Chirac was president, there was no legal way to pursue him. 
But, with Chirac retired and nearly 80, one “independent” judge has reopened the case. 
Chirac is alleged to have employed municipal civil servants when he was the mayor of Paris, 20 years ago, as aides in his electoral campaign. 
In Buenos Aires, one wonders about the motives of the Supreme Court, which has forbidden President Kristina Kirchner from changing the chairman of the central bank. 
Kirchner is not above suspicion, but the judges’ lack of a watertight legal case raises suspicions of a political motive. 
After the AKP was elected in 2003, the Supreme Court dissolved it in order to prevent Recep Tayyip Erdogan from becoming Prime Minister. 
The AKP had to change its name and, for a time, Erdogan had to foreswear the premiership. 
In 2008, prosecutors again tried to have the AKP dissolved, on charges that it was undermining the constitution. 
In 2009, the Supreme Court dissolved the main legal Kurdish party, the DST, accused of being connected with the Kurdish guerillas. 
This arbitrary decision deprived millions of Kurds from any legal representation and disrupted the AKP government’s attempt to reconcile the Kurds with the Turkish Republic. 
Of course, not all judges and prosecutors engage in nakedly partisan activities. 
European prosecutors tend to lean to the left, whereas their Latin American and Japanese counterparts tend to be conservative and pro-establishment. 
Perhaps the most famous investigating magistrate of all, Spain’s Baltasar Garzon, is usually portrayed as waging a borderless crusade for justice. 
But rather than pursuing such an open ideological agenda, most activist magistrates tend to act as a corporation: their motives can be politicized, but their professional, guild interests come first. 
Famously in France’s Ancien Régime, the judges collectively acted as a close-knit, self-contained social class. 
When one looks closely at the careers of judges in the above-mentioned countries, the law can vary, but cooptation is the usual rule of the game: a successful judge or prosecutor, in order to climb the professional ladder, must follow the guidance of his peers and increase the influence of his corporation. 
One should also consider why anyone wants to become a judge. 
Aspiring judicial candidates usually want to “clean up” society. 
It is revealing that in Italy, in the 1980’s, the judges who battled the Sicilian mafia described their campaign as “clean hands.” 
In that case, the label fit. 
More often, however, the cleansing is a pretext to change political direction after the people have voted in a way that magistrates oppose. 
Democracy is supposedly based on a separation and balance of institutional power. 
That equilibrium works so long as each institution is submitted to close scrutiny – which judges and magistrates have simply avoided. 
The Trial of Pavel S. 
Deprived of legal capacity, he was prohibited from acting independently, or at all, in most areas of life. 
He was no longer able to work, travel, choose his place of residence, buy or sell property, or even marry. 
The judge took away these rights without even informing him – indeed, Pavel only found out a year later. 
This Kafkaesque turn of events was possible because Pavel has mental health issues in a system that refuses to protect his rights. 
In Russia, roughly 125,000 people with mental disabilities are confined to institutions – for life. 
There are another 165,000 beds in psychiatric hospitals, with some 650,000 hospitalizations per year. 
But these statistics don’t tell the real story. 
Only rarely do stories like Shtukaturov’s get out. 
It is astonishing how little is known about the treatment of people with mental health problems in Russia. 
Moreover, the minds of many hospital directors are as firmly closed as the institutions themselves. 
So Shtukaturov’s victory before the European Court of Human Rights on March 27 provides hope that a turning point has been reached. 
The lawyer agreed to represent him. 
But when he was subsequently detained in a psychiatric hospital, the Russian government refused to allow the lawyer access to his client. 
Appeals in the Russian courts failed, and he filed a case with the ECHR in March 2006. 
The court found that Pavel’s ordeal violated several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which Russia is a signatory. 
According to the court, depriving someone of legal capacity constitutes a “very serious” interference of a person’s right to private life. 
Shtukaturov’s story is unique only because he was able to find his way to a lawyer. 
The Tricks of Trade Treaties 
Indeed, in some ways it is a step backwards. 
One source of discontent with globalization is that it deprives countries of their freedom to protect their economy and citizens. 
Special interests in industrial countries, it seems, take precedence over broader interests. 
In some ways, the agreement with Chile broke new ground--in the wrong direction. 
Particularly ironic was the provision designed to restrict Chile's use of capital controls for short-term speculative capital flows. 
Chile used these measures efficiently and effectively during the first part of the 1990s. 
Research suggests that these restrictions did not affect the flow of long-term capital. 
During this period of restrictions on capital flows, Chile grew rapidly, by 7% per year on average. 
(Of course, it still suffered the consequences of the downturn in copper prices--capital controls can't solve all problems). 
Today, Chile imposes no barriers to the inflow of capital. 
Why, then, be concerned that the new trade agreement restricts what Chile is not doing? 
Indeed, the problem today is not excessive capital inflows; international markets have largely turned against emerging markets. 
So restricting capital inflows is not necessary now. 
In the future, however, that may change. 
Much evidence, meanwhile, suggests that such flows present risk without reward: they lead to increased instability, not increased growth. 
Moreover, countries with heavy short-term indebtedness risk their political autonomy. 
The recent scare in Brazil before President Lula's election is a good example of this. 
The new treaty between America and Chile also represented an opportunity. 
Free-trade agreements do not ensure free trade. 
This is because the US uses many other protectionist measures to block foreign goods. 
After NAFTA was signed, America took actions to restrict tomatoes, avocados, corn brooms, and truck transportation. 
Chile now faces similar actions, as it has in the past, concerning some important exports, such as wine and salmon. 
Should Chile find other products that can compete against American producers, these too will likely face restrictions. 
The underlying US government philosophy is that American producers are better than those of any country. 
Therefore, if a country out-competes American firms, it must be because it engaged in some unfair practice. 
Too many Americans believe that while trade is good, imports are bad! 
This law is based on economic principles. 
If those laws were applied within America, most companies would be found to be engaged in unfair trade practices. 
The idea is not merely academic: Australia and New Zealand, in their free-trade agreement, did something along these lines. 
(While Chile might, in principal, undertake similar protectionist measures against the US, there is a complete asymmetry in power. 
American dumping duties on Chilean salmon could devastate that industry; 
Chile could take no action against a US industry that would have more than a miniscule impact on American firms.) 
So those who celebrate the new US/Chile trade agreement should be cautious. 
The Triumph of the Powerless 
NEW YORK – It was early June 1989. 
Then 40,000 people will fill Wenceslas Square!” 
Four months later, one week after people power brought down the Berlin Wall, revolution came to Prague. 
Students organized a small rally in the old Vyšehradcemetery, the burial grounds of Smetana and Dvořák in a fortress overlooking the city. 
Those who fell were kicked and clubbed where they lay. 
The night of November 17 – “Black Friday,” as it quickly came to be known – set Czechoslovakia alight. 
The next day, thousands of Czechs turned out in the streets. 
Twenty years later, we can only marvel at how brilliantly they performed. 
Prague was 1989’s happiest revolution, a delirium of good feelings. 
Dissidents just released from jail and eminent emigres suddenly returned home. 
The theme music was the Velvet Underground. 
The stage was the Magic Lantern, the underground theater that served as Havel’s headquarters. 
The audience, of course, was the world. 
We watched it happen on TV. 
It was so pure, so clean. It was the climax of the story, the Year of the Fall, a turning point in history: cliché transmuted into Truth. 
We knew our heroes would win. 
Everyone swept up by it felt young again, as though the world had suddenly, mysteriously, euphorically been made new. 
Disney could not have worked a more seductive transformation. 
Here were our children, taking to the streets. 
Here were our children, bloodied and beaten. 
Here were our children, finally, victorious. 
It helped that this revolution could be counted in days, a miracle of compression. 
Once confronted, the Communists almost ran from power. 
An organizer of the November 17 rally told me that he knew it was over that very day, when he expected several hundred people and 20,000 showed up. 
For me, the decisive moment was on Day 11. 
Half a million people had gathered in Prague’s Letná Park to hear Havel speak. 
To this day, I can hardly remember it without tears. 
As Havel finished, a light snow began to fall and, as if on cue, his listeners took their places. 
One by one, in single-file, hand in hand, they began to march toward Wenceslas Square, more than a mile and a half away, following a rickety horse-drawn cart bedecked with the wings of angels. 
Slowly, the procession wound its way along paths through Letná’s woods, now covered in white. 
Slowly, it snaked down the medieval streets behind Prague Castle and into the square in front of the president's palace. 
There were no chants, no cheers, no hints of confrontation. 
Just the unbroken line of people, holding hands and passing silently in the white darkness, the line looping back and forth outside the forbidding gates. 
The first of the marchers had reached the Square. The last still waited patiently in the park. 
Hand in hand, they bisected the city. 
Hand in hand, they drew a line. 
Here, on one side, stood the people, on the other their oppressors. 
This was the moment. 
Everyone had to choose. 
From high above the city, I looked out at these people dancing through the streets. 
Prague lay away in the distance, lighted and luminous in the snow. 
Never in my life have I seen anything so beautiful. 
I doubt I ever will again. 
The Triumphant Return of John Maynard Keynes 
NEW YORK – We are all Keynesians now. 
At one level, what is happening now is a triumph of reason and evidence over ideology and interests. 
But many, especially people working in the financial markets, pushed a type of “market fundamentalism.” 
The moment of enlightenment came only when those policies also began inflicting costs on the US and other advanced industrial countries. 
Keynes argued not only that markets are not self-correcting, but that in a severe downturn, monetary policy was likely to be ineffective. 
Fiscal policy was required. 
But not all fiscal policies are equivalent. 
Much, if not most, of last February’s US tax cut went into savings. 
The legacy of underinvestment in technology and infrastructure, especially of the green kind, and the growing divide between the rich and the poor, requires congruence between short-run spending and a long-term vision. 
Cutting expenditures on the Iraq war and increasing expenditures on education can simultaneously increase output in the short and long run and reduce the deficit. 
US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has tried hard to avoid having the blame fall on the Fed for deepening this downturn in the way that it is blamed for the Great Depression, famously associated with a contraction of the money supply and the collapse of banks. 
It is the flow of credit that is important, and the reason that the failure of banks during the Great Depression was important is that they were involved in determining creditworthiness; they were the repositories of information necessary for the maintenance of the flow of credit. 
But America’s financial system has changed dramatically since the 1930’s. 
They focused on buying assets, repackaging them, and selling them, while establishing a record of incompetence in assessing risk and screening for creditworthiness. 
Nothing has been done even to address their perverse incentive structures, which encourage short-sighted behavior and excessive risk taking. 
With private rewards so markedly different from social returns, it is no surprise that the pursuit of self-interest (greed) led to such socially destructive consequences. 
Meanwhile, too little is being done to help banks that actually do what banks are supposed to do – lend money and assess creditworthiness. 
The Federal government has assumed trillions of dollars of liabilities and risks. 
Otherwise, the deficit – which has doubled in eight years – will soar even more. 
In September, there was talk that the government would get back its money, with interest. 
As the bailout has ballooned, it is increasingly clear that this was merely another example of financial markets mis appraising risk – just as they have done consistently in recent years. 
The neo-liberal push for deregulation served some interests well. 
Financial markets did well through capital market liberalization. 
Enabling America to sell its risky financial products and engage in speculation all over the world may have served its firms well, even if they imposed large costs on others. 
Today, the risk is that the new Keynesian doctrines will be used and abused to serve some of the same interests. 
Have those who pushed deregulation ten years ago learned their lesson? 
Or will they simply push for cosmetic reforms – the minimum required to justify the mega-trillion dollar bailouts? 
Has there been a change of heart, or only a change in strategy? 
Bo Xilai Between the Dragon and His Wrath 
Bo faces three charges: corruption, bribery, and abuse of power. 
But his real offense is that he challenged the Chinese Communist Party’s way of doing things. 
Moreover, his wife’s conviction of the widely publicized murder of British businessman Neil Heywood has severely embarrassed the CCP. 
For the Party, however, Bo’s conviction will not mark the end of the scandal. 
But the fall of Bo and his family hardly rises to the level of Shakespearean tragedy. 
King Lear this is not. 
Of course, Bo and his wife and son have been morally dead for some time. 
Power sapped their humanity. 
Bogu killed Heywood, her lover and business partner, and many other innocent people died as a result of Bo’s ambition. 
Still, the CCP wants nothing more than to whitewash the scandal. 
This follows a similar official response to Chen Liangyu’s philandering and to Chen Xitong’s “Five Golden Flowers.” 
By limiting the charges, the CCP has limited the possible punishments. 
As always where the Party is concerned, Chinese law is mere window dressing. 
A trial such as Bo’s is invariably part of a political deal among insiders. 
The real story of Bo’s career – one of infidelity, betrayal, and corruption – is appalling. 
The victims include the Heywood family, his Chinese wife, and their children. 
Their tragedy stands as a profound indictment of the CCP’s rule, because no family is safe when governments are not subject to the rule of law. 
Happy households and harmonious states go together. 
But, in China, party leaders like Bo hold life-or-death power over citizens and their families. 
For the CCP, saving face is paramount. 
Bo’s son, Bo Guagua, will live an invisible life abroad. 
So Bo is anything but a tragic figure. 
When he cries for his dead daughter Cordelia, King Lear comes to understand the personal flaws that brought about his demise, and for this he elicits sympathy. 
When Bo appears in court, his pleas will not be so persuasive. 
We may see in his face Lear’s desperation: “Howl, howl, howl, howl! 
But in the courtroom, and all over China, the audience will remain unmoved – and rightly so. 
The Trouble with Eurobonds 
MUNICH – German Chancellor Angela Merkel has withstood the pressure from southern Europe: there will be no Eurobonds. 
Investors in Europe’s troubled economies are already getting enough as it is. 
And the European Central Bank will also blithely continue its bailout policy in terms of giving loans to the eurozone’s troubled members and purchasing their government bonds. 
This is understandable, given that the hope of interest-rate convergence was a decisive reason for these countries to join the euro in the first place. 
And, for a little more than a decade, from 1997-2007, this hope was realized. 
For the Italian state, interest-rate convergence brought a medium-term reduction in debt-service payments of up to 6% of GDP. 
That would have been sufficient to pay back the entire Italian national debt over about a decade and a half. 
Italy, however, chose to squander that interest-rate advantage. 
Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio today, at 120%, is as high as it was when the country entered the eurozone in the mid-1990’s. 
Now that interest-rate spreads are increasing again, the pain is considerable, prompting calls for Eurobonds. 
When other countries guarantee repayment, it is hoped, low interest rates will return. 
But who is to make these guarantees? 
The debt-to-GDP ratios of France and Germany are well above 80%, which isn’t all that far below Italy’s – and far above Spain’s. 
Pooling debts doesn’t make them go away. 
Everybody and every country must service their own debts; there is no way around that. 
And, incidentally, the current agitation about interest rates is a bit over the top. 
There is no indication that the markets are dysfunctional and overstating the differences between countries’ creditworthiness. 
The spreads are necessary to keep capital flows within the eurozone in check. 
Before the introduction of the euro, capital flows had been limited by uncertainty about exchange rates. 
This saved Europe from overly large external imbalances. 
Now, without exchange-rate risk, interest-rate spreads based on debtor countries’ credit ratings are the only remaining defense against excessive capital movements and the resulting external imbalances. 
For many years, Italy has disregarded the debt ceilings imposed by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Only when interest rates recently began to rise a bit did the government finally – and promptly – implement an austerity program, with the approval of all political parties. 
The markets, not political debt ceilings, are taken seriously; the introduction of Eurobonds would remove that disciplining function. 
To a limited extent, the same applies to the EU bailouts and ECB interventions. 
These could be justified during the recession of 2008-2009, but now they have become counter-productive, because they undermine the markets’ controlling function. 
By replacing the private credit that is being withdrawn with public credit, the external imbalances within the eurozone are being perpetuated. 
That, however, is a precondition for reducing external imbalances and reliance on foreign credit. 
This is reminiscent of central banks’ futile efforts, back when fixed exchange-rate regimes were common, to stabilize rates above their market equilibrium. 
The result, much like today, was merely to exacerbate market turbulence. 
The Trouble with European Defense 
WASHINGTON, D.C.: The Nice summit of EU leaders achieved few of its aims, but it did push the creation of a military identity for the EU, the European Defense Initiative (EDI), forward. 
That movement, however, is beginning to arouse worries, both in NATO and in the United States. 
It has long been a bedrock principle of American foreign policy to endorse any move to further integrate the European Union. 
If specific US interests might be harmed by such moves, the remedy is to seek revisions in detail, without opposing the overall initiative. 
When EDI first emerged, America’s response was no different. 
The seemingly endless Bosnia peacekeeping force is a case in point. 
Yet in the final weeks of the Clinton Administration America’s attitude to EDI changed. 
In his last visit to NATO, Secretary of Defense William Cohen replaced polite approval in principle with expressions of concern that stop just short of outright opposition. 
The reason is simple: money. 
Instead of adding resources to European security, it now seems that EDI will reduce them. 
In other words, there is no extra money to pay for EDI, but there are all sorts of extra requirements. 
What is urgently needed in Europe is less bureaucratic overhead and more trained troops. 
For America, this means that the European forces of NATO will actually be weakened by EDI, adding to the potential burden on US combat forces. 
That is not something even the most polite US diplomat can welcome. 
The Trouble with Hope 
PARIS – America’s presidential election campaign is being followed in Europe with passionate interest. 
It is seen as a long saga full of surprises. 
But Europeans’ interest in this presidential election cannot mask the fact that what they expect from it is far from clear. 
America as a model or America as a protector – this “European dilemma” is in itself new. 
This is no longer the case. 
The collapse of the USSR, America’s self-inflicted wounds – particularly in Iraq – and the spectacular rise of Asia have changed European perceptions of the US. 
America is no longer the protector or model that it used to be, nor is it alone in terms of influence and power. 
In this sense, Europe has come to see itself, at least in part, as an alternative dream for everyone who had stopped dreaming about America. 
But, seen from within, the EU model often appears less convincing. 
Thus, many Europeans continue to be nostalgic for America as a model. 
For these Europeans, Barack Obama, campaigning under the banner of “hope,” is the ideal choice to restore, as if by magic, America’s soft power. 
After all, he himself incarnates the American Dream. 
They worry about not only competence, but also the old transatlantic issue of “burden sharing.” 
But it would also be less easy to reject a call for greater burden sharing in the world. 
This “defensive” view of transatlantic relations is problematic. 
This is Obama’s America. 
Of course, the greater your expectations are, the greater the risk of disappointment. 
But, after eight years of America’s self-imposed isolation under Bush, it is a risk worth taking. 
Even if America is no longer the world’s only superpower, it still remains the “indispensable nation.” 
So Europeans are right to be fascinated by America’s presidential election. 
Regardless of who wins, the consequences of the outcome will reverberate throughout the world. 
The Trouble with Japanese Nationalism 
But will the Bush administration use its influence to nudge Abe away from inflammatory behavior? 
But Koizumi also legitimized a new Japanese nationalism, antagonizing China and South Korea by his annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. 
If anything, Abe is even more committed to building an assertive and unapologetic Japan. 
The problem is not the 12 Class-A war criminals interred at the shrine; the real problem is the Yushukan military museum next door. 
It follows the nationalist narrative: Japan, a victim of the European colonial powers, sought only to protect the rest of Asia from them. 
One might be able to defend the museum as one viewpoint among many in a pluralist democracy. 
But there is no other museum in Japan that gives an alternative view of Japan’s twentieth-century history. 
That is an unconvincing stance. 
In fact, unlike Germany, Japan has never come to terms with its own responsibility for the Pacific War. 
According to Watanabe, the Pacific War boiled down to race, as the US was determined to keep a non-white people down. 
(I am regularly sent books by Japanese writers that “explain” how the Nanjing Massacre was a big fraud.) 
This leaves the US in a difficult position. 
A number of American strategists are eager to ring China with a NATO-like defensive barrier, building outward from the US-Japan Security Treaty. 
But America should be careful about what it wishes for. 
The legitimacy of the entire American military position in the Far East is built around the US exercising Japan’s sovereign function of self-defense. 
Japan’s unilateral revision of Article 9, viewed against the backdrop of its new nationalism, would isolate Japan from virtually the whole of Asia. 
President Bush was unwilling to say anything about Japan’s new nationalism to his “good friend Junichiro” out of gratitude for Japanese support in Iraq. 
Now that Japan has withdrawn its small contingent of troops, perhaps Bush will speak plainly to Abe. 
The Trouble with Libertarian Paternalism 
A clear example is financial regulation, which in many ways is a form of paternalism. 
In the US, the low risk assigned to senior tranches of mortgage-backed securities made them attractive instruments for banks to hold, given the relatively high return they offered. 
But they proved far from safe, despite the prior conventional wisdom. 
Other examples of the danger of the coordinating power of government paternalism abound. 
Today, they are seen as the best way to concentrate and perpetuate many of those ills. 
As a result, many went astray. 
The fashion today is to integrate poor households into flourishing communities. 
No doubt we will discover some unintended consequences in the future, and the power of government coordination will ensure that those consequences are widespread. 
But some amount of paternalism is necessary in civilized societies. 
Social security is a paternalistic form of forced savings for old age, preventing individuals from consuming and saving as they please. 
It exists, in part, because individuals know that civilized societies will never stand by and watch the elderly starve. 
So, if paternalism has benefits as well as costs, how do we get the former without the latter? 
So libertarian paternalism, in their view, eliminates one of the main objections to paternalism – that it constrains individual choice. 
For example, in deciding how their pension savings will be allocated, most people simply choose the default option in their employer-offered plan. 
Often, the default option is unsuitable for most individuals – for instance, it typically allocates all savings to low-return money-market funds. 
That is the paternalistic part. 
The libertarian part is that the employee has the right to opt out of the default option. 
Because people rarely move away from the default option, the employer’s paternalistic choice prevails, and we get libertarian paternalism. 
What is not to like? 
The problem is that the semblance of choice in libertarian paternalism is an illusion. 
Choice remains unexercised, because individuals do not consciously think through their decision. 
One response is to point out that most plans already have a default option that determines savings allocations. 
This, they believe, is better than the current typical default option of putting individuals’ money into money-market funds. 
Could there be a better alternative? 
The conventional wisdom could be offered as a recommendation, along with explanations of why it makes sense, but it would not be the default. 
This would force people to exercise choice. 
Some people would differ from the conventional wisdom, benefiting the system by introducing some variety and resilience. 
More generally, the flaw in some forms of libertarian paternalism is that the free choice that it appears to offer leaves the paternalism largely unconstrained. 
Would it not be far better to force conscious choice in order to limit the consequences of paternalistic mistakes? 
The Trouble with Poland 
“We are only demanding one thing, that we get back what was taken from us….If Poland had not had to live through the years 1939-1945, it would be a country of 66 million.” 
Kaczynski’s words, however, stand in contradiction with what happened in Paris this July 14th. 
Poland today is no longer “God’s Playground,” to use Norman Davies’s famous phrase. 
Instead, it seems more like a child’s playground: a strange mixture of inferiority and superiority complexes. 
The problem is that Poland’s unjustified lack of confidence is leading to an extremely unpleasant form of intolerance toward others. 
To understand what went wrong with Poland, a comparison with Spain might be useful. 
In the nineteenth century, Europe’s southern and eastern extremities were united by common decay. 
Poland had disappeared as an independent nation, the victim of its powerful neighbors’ greed; 
Spain was a country that no longer mattered. 
This dual decline was a subject frequently discussed by historians across the continent. 
They generally emphasized the failure of both countries to adjust their political systems to the requirements of the times. 
Today, Spain and Poland both appear to be experiencing a renaissance, thanks to the framework of European unity. 
Their economies are booming. 
Democracy has been restored after half-century of dictatorial disruption. 
Yet the buoyant self-confidence of today’s Spain is completely absent from Poland. 
Is this because Poland’s sufferings were even more terrible than Spain’s? 
Is it because it is more difficult to emerge from a totalitarian regime than from an authoritarian one? 
Is it because Spain has had 20 more years to be vaccinated by the EU against the temptations of nationalism? 
All these explanations probably contain an element of truth. 
And perhaps there is another factor: there is more pride and less self-doubt in Spanish culture than in the Polish one. 
What seems clear is that Poland today can choose among two paths. 
It can continue to play a “nuisance value” role in the Union. 
But in that case, it must at least play well. 
Poland’s government cannot simultaneously pretend to resist Russia’s energy pressures and yet reject Germany’s offers of help. 
When all things are considered, Germany is a more reliable ally and partner than Ukraine, which some in Warsaw see as a potential counterweight to Russia. 
The realities of the present must not be obscured by the burdens of the past. 
Entering the EU means integrating into a country’s politics a logic dominated by the concept of reconciliation. 
In this sense, Germany, having stifled the evils of aggressive nationalism, remains the most “European” country in Europe. 
To deny this, to threaten to undo Polish-German reconciliation, is to harm Poland’s fundamental national interests. 
By antagonizing Germany, indeed all of the EU, Poland is merely encouraging a revisionist Russia. 
If Poland’s current leaders want to re-play nineteenth-century balance-of-power games, they should understand where the real weight of power in Europe lies. 
The other path Poland can take is that of Spain. 
Javier Solana, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, symbolizes the role that Spaniards are playing in building Europe’s international identity. 
Spain’s influence is, to a large extent, a result of its national self-confidence. 
Demographically and strategically, Poland is by far the most important of the EU’s new members. 
Former French President Jacques Chirac, with his seeming contempt for these new members, is gone. 
Nobody is out to insult the Polish people gratuitously. 
Only the Poles can harm Poland’s reputation and influence, and one must say that they have excelled at it of late. 
In the course of the last five years, while teaching at the College of Europe in Natolin, near Warsaw, I have witnessed at first hand Poland’s remarkable progress. 
Sadly, there is a “disconnect” between Poland’s economic progress and the discourse and behavior of its politicians. 
Warsaw exudes positive energy. 
The famous Polish plumber is a guarantee of high-quality work across Europe. 
The problem is in the eyes of the beholder. 
If Poland were less unjustifiably afraid of its future, it would be less obsessed with a past that will not pass away. 
For the “real Poland” that emerged after 1989 is much more promising than their political incarnation of it. 
The Trouble with Treating Trauma 
When disaster strikes, the arrival of ``trained counselors'' is as much a part of the theater of disaster as the arrival of the emergency services. 
What do these counselors actually do? 
Usually, they perform some form of what is called ``debriefing'' or ``critical incident stress debriefing.'' 
But do these sessions do any good? 
Debriefing is invariably a short, usually single session, an intervention that is performed with as many of those caught up in a traumatic event as possible. 
The hope is to reduce acute emotional distress and prevent the onset of post-trauma psychiatric disorder. 
Many organizations offer debriefing as part of their response to traumatic incidents - such as police officers involved in firearm incidents, or bank staff who witness robberies. 
There are many reasons why belief in the effectiveness of debriefing has become so widespread. 
When facing disasters, all of us feel a need to do something. 
Many people who have been debriefed judge the experience positively. 
But does it work? 
There is only one way to really know if any intervention does more good than harm, and that is via randomized controlled trials. 
The studies undertaken so far provide no evidence of any benefit through intervention. 
Perhaps for some people not talking is the most appropriate response. 
Indeed, psychological defense mechanisms may exist precisely because it is not always ``better out than in.'' 
Perhaps debriefing serves merely to professionalize distress - part of the wider process nowadays by which adversity has been professionalized. 
This is inevitable, but it should not distract us from the main findings. 
So we must reassess how we respond to trauma. 
There can be no doubt that those who are attempting to help people involved in disasters and trauma have noble motives, but that is not enough. 
Compulsory debriefing, which is still used in some organizations, must cease forthwith. 
But should we be skeptical of all ``talking treatments?'' 
What is the difference then between these talking therapies and the vogue for debriefing? 
Two things. 
Second, these are skilled interventions, delivered by practitioners with well defined and well regulated professional skills, who are either clinical psychologists or psychiatrists. 
They are also given over a period of time. 
Sadly in mental health, effective treatments are neither swift nor easily learnt. 
There is also a final paradox. 
When disaster strikes, it is the experience of all health professionals that they are often overwhelmed with offers of help. 
But it is the mundane, non-newsworthy traumas of life that cause real harm. 
The old people shattered by a burglary. 
The wife driven to depression by her husband's infidelity. 
The bank manager who cannot get to work because of panic attacks. 
Or the teenager disabled by obsessive compulsive disorder. 
So we should take a long, hard look at how we manage our resources. 
It seems better to concentrate on delivering effective treatments to the smaller number of people who really need them, and not on the larger number of people who don't. 
The story of debriefing provides a salutary lesson. 
First, people are more resilient than we give them credit for. 
Any health care intervention has the capacity to do harm as well as good, and occasionally the balance between the two will surprise us. 
The True Costs of the Iraq War 
The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless. 
Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $100 and $200 billion, other officials quickly demurred. 
For example, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $60 billion. 
It now appears that Lindsey’s numbers were a gross underestimate. 
Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government. 
And the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole. 
Nor does the administration want to face up to the military’s recruiting and retention problems. 
Moreover, the war is extremely wearing on equipment, some of which will have to be replaced. 
These budgetary costs (exclusive of interest) amount to $652 billion in our conservative estimate and $799 billion in our moderate estimate. 
Of course, the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families. 
But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings. 
But the costs don’t stop there. 
Being extremely conservative, we estimate the overall effect on the economy if only $5 or $10 of the increase is attributed to the war. 
At the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere. 
There are a number of other costs, some potentially quite large, although quantifying them is problematic. 
That Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs. 
But there is little doubt that the option value has been greatly impaired and will likely remain so for several years. 
In short, even our “moderate” estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America’s involvement in Iraq. 
And our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself. 
Nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war. 
Certainly, when a war’s timing is a matter of choice, as in this case, inadequate preparation is even less justifiable. 
But such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration’s reckoning. 
Elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century. 
The Truth About Climate Change 
EXETER – Many people ask how sure we are about the science of climate change. 
The most definitive examination of the scientific evidence is to be found in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its last major report published in 2007. 
I had the privilege of being chairman or co-chairman of the Panel’s scientific assessments from 1988 to 2002. 
The world’s top scientists could not have spoken more strongly. 
Unfortunately, strong vested interests have spent millions of dollars on spreading misinformation about climate change. 
First, they tried to deny the existence of any scientific evidence for global warming. 
The scientific evidence does not support such arguments. 
Therefore it is necessary that very strong efforts be made to hold the average global temperature rise below 2º Celsius relative to its preindustrial level. 
The IEA also points out that the targets can be achieved without unacceptable economic damage. 
In fact, the IEA lists many benefits that will be realized if its recommendations are followed. 
The Truth about NATO Burden-Sharing 
Naturally, these allies feel that their efforts are under-valued. 
What is a fair and equitable burden? 
Defense transformation is a key aspect of burden-sharing. 
Large proportions of NATO allies’ armed forces are still better suited for static territorial defense than for the expeditionary type of operation needed in Afghanistan. 
Developing the necessary expeditionary capabilities is a major feature of NATO’s transformation process. 
Many allies face the dilemma of either spending money on operations or investing in new acquisition programs. 
Extra time and money has therefore had to be invested in the acquisition of these capabilities. 
How can you evaluate a contribution of light infantry against the provision of critical enablers such as helicopters or air-to-air refueling tankers? 
Over what time period do you make your calculations? 
Common funding, with all members paying a share according to their GDP, is one instrument that can be used to achieve more equitable burden-sharing. 
Burden-sharing is a sensitive issue, for both NATO and the international community, and passions sometimes run high. 
No single measure can resolve the burden-sharing problem. 
Alliance solidarity is not just a slogan. 
The Truth about Negotiations 
Then again, reaching an agreement might never have been Cameron’s goal. 
What if the outcome is beneficial but contrary to the principles of the negotiating parties? 
Imagine that you are at a negotiating table and want the other party to agree with you. 
A strategy that could work would be to stress how the outcome is beneficial to everyone involved. 
But the outcome you propose might not be fair, or realistic, or you might be consciously lying. So, although based on interests, such a proposal will not be easily accepted. 
Indeed, when one ponders how many issues there are to consider, it becomes obvious that negotiation is a type of communication that involves far more than interests. 
Some would argue that successful negotiators require only tact – the ability to use principles to conceal one’s true interests. 
If this were correct, the United States was right to wage war on Iraq on the basis of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s regime. 
But it is now widely accepted that the way in which the US negotiated its way into war was a mistake – one that has cost it enormous credibility as a negotiating partner. 
Defending economic aid to Europe after World War II, General George C. Marshall, then US Secretary of State, gave an inspirational speech that argued that US policy is not directed against “any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.” The Marshall Plan was as much about principles as it was about protecting US interests. 
Immanuel Kant famously argued otherwise – that morality should be free of non-universal interests. 
But the contemporary philosopher Jürgen Habermas argues that moral norms are valid as long as people accept them freely after having considered the consequences of their implementation for the satisfaction of interests. 
In some cases, the defense of interests alone might seem appropriate – for example, in certain business transactions. 
The more complicated a negotiation, though, the more difficult it is to disregard complex issues such as values and norms or the importance of being sincere. 
As Aristotle said: “that which is true and better is naturally always easier to prove and more likely to persuade.” 
In today’s globalized world, true negotiation is necessary. 
Countries and peoples form an interconnected web of interests that cannot be easily disentangled and satisfied in an isolated manner. 
Resolving disputes requires mutually accepted principles that guide how individuals and countries interact. 
Negotiation is the path toward successful conflict resolution, but it should be conducted according to basic rules of true and open communication. 
Countries and peoples should stop debating the interests that often divide them and start discussing the principles that unite them. 
As long as communication is conducted truthfully and with respect to values, norms, and objective facts, negotiations will be able to achieve consensus and agreement. 
The Truth About the Yugoslav Truth Commission 
When dictatorships fall, how can societies heal the wounds? 
Truth commissions are increasingly seen as the way forward. 
But when do they work best and what structures and rules make them work most effectively? 
Serbia is a test case for all of these issues. 
The resemblance ends there. 
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by legislation after careful consideration by parliament and extensive discussion across the country. 
Fourteen months elapsed between the time Justice Minister Dullah Omar announced the government's intention to establish a commission and its signature into law by President Nelson Mandela. 
The mandate and the operating procedures of the Commission were clearly spelled out. A timetable for the Commission to report was specified. 
Measures were incorporated to ensure that the Commission would obtain the testimony of perpetrators as well as victims. 
299 names were submitted. The committee held public hearings and selected 25 to forward to President Mandela. 
He chose 17, appointing Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a man widely acknowledged as South Africa's moral conscience, to chair the Commission. 
The contrast in Yugoslavia is stark. 
Yugoslavia’s Commission was appointed by President Kostunica with only the vaguest of mandates, and with no procedures, no budget, no timetable, and no Chairman. 
Parliament was not involved. The Yugoslav President acted on his own. 
The Commission's appointment has been little noted in the Yugoslav press. 
Kostunica's off-hand way of creating the Commission signaled to the public that this is not serious. 
The recent resignations of two of the Commission’s most respected members exposed the body’s fundamental flaws. 
The resignations also showed that prominent Serbs have their own doubts about President Kostunica’s ill-conceived approach. 
A real truth commission could play a useful role in Yugoslavia. 
Like it or not, President Kostunica will probably not escape his obligation to turn them over for trial. 
It is not self-evident how a Yugoslav truth commission should operate. 
Its most difficult task will be to obtain the testimony of the victims. 
What incentives could be provided to induce them to testify? 
Could the Commission obtain their testimony outside Yugoslavia? 
If it cannot obtain the testimony of the victims, what other means could be used to document the crimes that it should consider? 
Some of those who played key roles in the South African Commission and in truth commissions from all over the world will attend that conference. 
President Kostunica is also slated to participate. 
The Tsunami Effect 
The extraordinary international response to the tsunamis that devastated South Asia is a remarkable political phenomenon. 
One useful consequence is that wealthy countries’ low levels of assistance to those less fortunate has gained wider attention. 
At that point, the Bush administration had committed a measly $35 million in aid. 
While condemning Egeland’s comment, Bush quickly multiplied America’s commitment ten-fold. 
In addition, he enlisted former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a private fundraising effort. 
This neatly fit a standard response to criticism of the level of American assistance: that private philanthropy exceeds government aid. 
Perhaps even some oil-rich governments will be embarrassed by attention to their miserliness in doling out assistance. 
In recent years, many more people have died in the conflicts in Sudan and Congo than were killed by the tsunamis. 
Some were direct victims of the fighting in those countries, while a much larger number died from war-related hunger and disease. 
Given the limited number of skilled personnel available to humanitarian agencies, human resources could follow the money. 
Another question likely to loom large in coming months is whether assistance is politicized and free of corruption. 
Aceh province in Indonesia was previously largely closed to outsiders. 
It was ruled by the Indonesian army, which fought a brutal civil war against the separatist Free Aceh Movement. 
Similarly, northern Sri Lanka is the main battleground for the long-running conflict between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 
Despite headway towards settling that struggle, violence continues and could erupt again in full fury. 
A worthy goal, but successful models do not come readily to mind. 
More common is a situation like that of ex-Yugoslavia. 
During the wars in Croatia and Bosnia the UN was responsible for humanitarian assistance and also dedicated to peacemaking. 
Yet it was never able to use the former to advance the latter. 
It would not be the first time that a government misused aid intended for disaster victims. 
In the process, he incited popular support for the left-wing Sandinista guerrillas who toppled his government later in the decade. 
The tsunamis provide an opportunity for the UN to reclaim the high ground that it lost recently. 
It also requires making sure that the person in charge gets the staff assistance and the political backing required to do the job well. 
The Tunisian Catalyst 
The eyes of the world are now set on this small country of ten million, to learn the lessons of its recent experience and to see if the young people who overthrew a corrupt autocrat can create a stable, functioning democracy. 
First, the lessons. 
Nor is it enough to follow the dictates of international financial markets – that may get good bond ratings and please international investors, but it does not mean that jobs are being created or that standards of living are being increased for most citizens. 
Indeed, the fallibility of the bond markets and rating agencies was evident in the run up to the 2008 crisis. 
That they now looked with disfavor at Tunisia’s move from authoritarianism to democracy does not redound to their credit – and should never be forgotten. 
Even providing good education may not suffice. 
All over the world, countries are struggling to create enough jobs for new entrants into the labor force. 
High unemployment and pervasive corruption, however, create a combustible combination. 
And corruption American-style can result in trillion-dollar gifts to pharmaceutical companies, the purchase of elections with massive campaign contributions, and tax cuts for millionaires as medical care for the poor is cut. 
Moreover, in many countries, democracy has been accompanied by civil strife, factionalism, and dysfunctional governments. 
In this regard, Tunisia starts on a positive note: a sense of national cohesion created by the successful overthrow of a widely hated dictator. 
Tunisia must strive to maintain that sense of cohesion, which requires a commitment to transparency, tolerance, and inclusiveness – both politically and economically. 
A sense of fair play requires voice, which can be achieved only through public dialogue. 
Everyone stresses the rule of law, but it matters a great deal what kind of rule of law is established. 
Tunisia may not be able to prevent special interests from capturing its government, but, if public financing of electoral campaigns and restrictions on lobbying and revolving doors between the public and private sectors remain absent, such capture will be not only possible, but certain. 
There are many balancing acts to be mastered: a government that is too powerful might violate citizens’ rights, but a government that is too weak would be unable to undertake the collective action needed to create a prosperous and inclusive society – or to prevent powerful private actors from preying on the weak and defenseless. 
Latin America has shown that there are problems with term limits for political officeholders, but not having term limits is even worse. 
So constitutions need to be flexible. 
Enshrining economic-policy fads, as the European Union has done with its central bank’s single-minded focus on inflation, is a mistake. 
A good place for Tunisia’s debate to begin is deciding how far beyond the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the country should go in writing its new constitution. 
The Turkish Chimera 
While it is too early to predict the final outcomes, several important regional implications are already beginning to emerge. 
First, the revolts are a double-edged sword for Iran. 
Second, the upheavals threaten to leave Israel more isolated. 
With Mubarak gone, Israel has lost its most important regional partner. 
Indeed, given the serious deterioration in Israel’s relations with Turkey, Mubarak’s departure has deprived it of its two most demonstrable allies in the region. 
While Egypt’s interim military regime has pledged to adhere to the 1979 peace agreement, a new, more democratic government could adopt a different attitude. 
Third, the pressures for democratic change have significantly bolstered Turkey’s regional influence. 
Many Arabs regard the brand of moderate Islam espoused by Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as a possible model for the Middle East. 
Many Turks have begun to see things the same way. 
But Turkey’s historical experience and political evolution differ in important ways from Arab countries’. 
As a result, its model cannot easily be transplanted. 
This class, one of the AKP’s main pillars of electoral support, does not exist elsewhere in the Middle East. 
Moreover, the Turkish model owes much to the leadership of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic. 
Ataturk, a committed Westernizer and political visionary, transformed the multinational Ottoman empire into a modern state based on Turkish nationalism. 
But, in transforming Turkey, Ataturk did not begin entirely from scratch. 
The process of Westernization and modernization had begun in the late nineteenth century under the Ottomans during the period of the Tanzimat. 
Both were elitist and state-driven. 
These important pre-conditions do not exist in the Arab Middle East. 
Most countries in the region lack strong independent political institutions and traditions on which to build a democratic political order. 
They also lack a vibrant civil society. 
Ultimately, the Arab countries do not have the benefit of Turkey’s tradition of moderate Islam or its history of successfully fusing Islam and Westernization. 
As a result, the collapse of the old power structures in many Middle East countries is likely to be accompanied by considerable political turmoil and violence. 
Taksim and the Left 
ISTANBUL – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center. 
But heavy-handed police repression launched a massive civic movement that has spread to the entire country. 
The movement’s rapid growth was fueled by widespread opposition to what many regard as official efforts to regiment lifestyles, as well as by frustration over perceived economic inequities. 
Indeed, though environmentalists and secular youth spearheaded the protest movement, it became remarkably diverse and inclusive almost overnight. 
Some of the protests became violent. 
Overall, however, the movement has remained peaceful and even joyous. 
Moreover, important figures in or close to the ruling Justice and Development Party expressed their willingness to hold a dialogue with the protesters. 
President Abdullah Gül, in particular, played a calming, statesmanlike role. 
In this sense, the Taksim “sit-in” resembles protests elsewhere, particularly in the advanced democracies, from the “Occupy Wall Street” movement to the protests in Spain and Italy. 
To be sure, there are country-specific features to such protests – including, in Turkey’s case, the reaction against lifestyle paternalism. 
But social democrats must understand why the protests developed quite independently of existing, organized, center-left politics. 
Without such realism, the center left in Europe and the emerging world cannot regain political momentum. 
The way much of GDP is now produced has made it significantly harder for the left to organize in traditional ways. 
That has weakened center-left parties. 
Yet information technology and global social media have empowered people to overcome social fragmentation along occupational, residential, and national lines. 
On some recent days, posts about Taksim Square have reportedly occupied a huge part of the entire world’s “Tweet space.” 
In this corner of cyberspace, there is, of course, everything under the sun, including calls for the worst sort of sectarianism. 
And yet, while civil society can be a trigger, sooner or later democratic politics has to drive the process of change. 
In the eurozone, stock prices are soaring, while joblessness is at a record-high 12.2%. 
Finally, the environment, climate change, and global solidarity will be defining themes of the twenty-first century. 
Acting on their own, nation-states can successfully address neither tax avoidance nor carbon emissions. 
The success of Germany’s Green Party reflects the focus that it has placed on many of these issues. 
The events that started in Taksim Square are specific to Turkey, but they mirror aspirations that are universal. 
The same can be said for the challenge facing the democratic left. 
The Twilight of France’s Republican Aristocracy 
PARIS – No tumbrils have appeared in Paris’s Place de la Concorde, but a revolution may be underway in France nonetheless. 
Recent weeks have seen the trial of former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and the conviction of former Defense Minister Charles Pasqua. 
Now even former President Jacques Chirac has learned that he is not immune from prosecution. 
Is France’s “Republican Monarchy,” to borrow a phrase from Jean-François Revel, about to be overthrown? 
The French Revolution never actually ended the privileges of France’s ruling elites. 
True enough, some aristocratic heads rolled, but the nobility eventually returned to France. 
But the concept of the “Republican monarchy,” which is mostly concerned with the mores of French presidents and their entourages, did not really take hold until the Fifth Republic. 
Once elected, the French president and his court gain access to financial privileges that are not always legal. 
Journalists avoided commenting on these matters. 
The public either was unaware of any excesses, or deemed the ruling elite corrupt by definition. 
The apex of the aristocratic Republic was reached under the Socialist President François Mitterrand, who ruled from 1981 to 1995. 
Only the media elite knew, and they never mentioned it. 
Chirac, who succeeded Mitterrand as president, was only slightly more cautious. 
All this has changed. 
In less than a week, Pasqua was sentenced to three years in jail for illegal arms trading with Angola. 
It turns out that this Mitterrand shared with Polanski a taste for teenagers (of the same sex in Mitterrand’s case). 
So, something of a democratic revolution may be underway in France. 
The ancien regime’s supporters call it a “populist” revolution. 
But it is a revolution made in the courts, not the streets. 
French judges have become more independent than they traditionally were. 
The Internet is a seminal lever in this process. 
Is the private life of France’s elite also now to be exposed? 
This right to a private life, including extramarital affairs, has always been a sacred cow of French politics. 
The journalists who knew about Mitterrand’s second wife argued that it was a private matter. 
Sarkozy understands the new rules of the game. 
But aristocratic habits do not die easily, even in Sarkozy’s overexposed regime. 
Sarkozy’s son, Jean, has already been elected to a major local government office at the tender age of 22. 
Being as ambitious as the father, Jean Sarkozy recently tried to have himself appointed as chairman of a powerful public company. 
Bloggers, followed by traditional journalists, went up in arms against such blatant nepotism. 
Young Sarkozy withdrew. 
France, it seems, does not yet share the real democratic culture of, say, Scandinavia. 
French ministers have yet to be seen taking the bus or the subway to their offices. 
French ministries still occupy the former eighteenth-century palaces of the King and his nobility. 
As long as the governing elite works in this splendor, one cannot expect that they will ever behave like common mortals. 
But, like French hauteur in international affairs, the end of an era may be at hand. 
The Twilight of Pervez Musharraf 
It is said that political power in Pakistan flows from the three A’s: Allah, the Army, and support from America. 
Of the three, it is the army leadership that has the clearest means of ridding the country of Pakistan’s president in uniform, Pervez Musharraf. 
But few international leaders face such a wide range of sworn domestic enemies. 
Since seizing power following a 1999 coup, Musharraf has survived at least three serious assassination attempts. 
The threat of terrorist attacks inside the country will continue to rise. 
Musharraf also has plenty of secular enemies. 
Their anger, inflamed in March when he tried unsuccessfully to sack the Supreme Court’s independent-minded chief justice, rages on. 
The court recently ruled that Nawaz Sharif, who Musharraf unseated eight years ago, must be allowed to return from exile. 
Sharif is planning a grand entrance. 
His “decisive struggle against dictatorship” – and determined opposition to any deal with Bhutto that excludes him – will intensify. 
Musharraf is warning him to remain in London. 
America isn’t happy with Musharraf, either. 
His recent flirtation with a plan to bypass Bhutto and declare emergency rule provoked pointed Bush administration criticism. 
But it’s the army that is most likely to eventually decide the fate of his presidency. 
His unpopularity has become their unpopularity. 
Aware of a potential threat from within their ranks, Musharraf has populated his inner circle with relatively junior (and reliably loyal) officers. 
But a deal that makes Bhutto prime minister would undermine the military’s influence – and eventually its support for Musharraf’s presidency. 
As prime minister, she could eventually revisit her deal with Musharraf from a position of strength. 
The army is unlikely to move on Musharraf directly unless subtler methods fail. 
Musharraf’s presidency won’t survive long without military backing. 
Instead, they will most likely support cosmetic political reforms, including a new law that formally separates the roles of army commander and head of state. 
That is the strategy the military adopted in 1988, following the mysterious plane crash that killed former President (and General) Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. 
The army leadership ordered elections, permitted the formation of a civilian government, and then stage-managed the political process from the wings. 
Bhutto, the leader of a secular party that now enjoys substantial support in Washington, would dominate policy planning in the next government at Musharraf’s expense. 
She must build on her domestic support, but she can rely on economic and security cooperation with America to safeguard the country’s stability. 
In addition, the military’s role as guarantor of stability, and its tight control of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, the army’s crown jewels, will continue. 
The Bush administration can therefore enthusiastically back a return to civilian rule and claim a much-needed victory for democracy in a Muslim country. 
But Bhutto would inherit Musharraf’s domestic enemies. 
Sharif would fulminate against her every misstep, threats of attack from religious radicals would continue, and the military would safeguard its interests from just off stage. 
The military will, under any scenario, continue to quell fears of complete political chaos. 
The Two Communities of Europe 
Europe finds itself at a paradoxical turning point. 
As long as this is true, integration cannot succeed. 
This won't happen automatically or overnight. 
There is nothing comparable in EU integration, which seems far more like a deliberate choice by an imperial few. 
So it is difficult to see how this path could lead to the collective and individual identity that European unification requires. 
Instead, Europe should draw on two periods of community building. 
Medieval Christianity in its 13th-century formed a community united around a common faith, with Rome as its unifying power center. 
Saint Peter's successors as Roman pontiffs oversaw a network of Church-run universities which educated cultural elites in the same way and in the same language (Latin). 
A network of churches--built in the same style throughout Europe--shared a common calendar and liturgy. 
Medieval Christianity was by nature European, although it avoided the word itself and accepted all national forms of cultural expression. 
The ``Republic of Letters,'' lasting from Erasmus until the Enlightenment, represents Europe's second community. 
A communications network that allowed rapid dissemination of ideas served a common spirit. 
The emergence of both communities--albeit in pursuit of opposite ends--forms the key reference point for a European identity. 
Only this will do justice to the contradictory essence of the European spirit. 
But by this standard, the preamble of the draft European Constitution drawn up by the Convention is utterly inadequate. 
Although a compromise solution was provisionally accepted, its message is weak and obscure. 
A pity. 
To be sure, Europe has paid a heavy and painful price for its religious rifts, and these feuds must not be rekindled. 
This calls for a bit of ``European metaphysics.'' 
The answer seems to revolve around the central place that European civilisation has given the human person since mixing barbarian customs with Christianity. 
But we also find it in the Enlightenment tradition, which declares that man is the measure of all things or that he is vested with grandeur and dignity. 
The danger here is that ``community values'' might become a partition that generates attitudes and policies of exclusion. 
In fact, human rights must define the very image of Europe; it must be its emblem or even its ``religion.'' 
But most importantly, European integration must not only define institutions and policies, but it must also galvanise ideas. 
The Two-Faced Economy 
ROME: Italy's economy has two faces. 
On one side, sectors of the economy demonstrate extraordinary productivity, and have won big shares of international markets. 
The answer is at the same time simple and rich in consequences for economic policy. 
In Italy, the country's stagnant GDP masks two phenomena which cancel each other out. 
Productivity grows due to the expansion of the most dynamic and efficient firms, but the percentage of those who work is decreasing all the time. 
The result is that the productive sectors of the economy do not succeed in "pulling" with them the ever greater mass of people who do not work. 
Data on labor force participation is almost incredible. 
This is the lowest number in all of the European Union. 
Among OECD countries, the only one with a percentage of participation in the economy lower than that of Italy is Turkey, where 53% of the population makes up the labor force. 
This percentage is lower today than in 1970, while in the United States the equivalent number has increased from 65% to 78%. 
What accounts for this propensity of people not to look for work, and why does what is happening in Italy matter to other countries? 
First of all, an extremely generous system of retirement benefits makes the "no work" option attractive, though not quite obligatory. 
Indeed, abandoning work at an ever younger age relative to the longer life expectancy of Italians is something particularly worrying. 
When a man works and marginal tax rates are very high, the wife very often prefers to stay at home. 
This state of affairs is reproduced inside individual families: young people of 30 survive thanks to the work of the head of the family, who supports everyone. 
Reform of the pension system is often attacked as a zero-sum game, in which whatever one person loses another gains. 
Put in these terms, the problem is always solved by giving more to those who have the most political power. 
Italy's recent budget, which neither confronted the pensions issue nor the issue of fiscal reform, demonstrates this fully. 
Here is the grand delusion of the budget and the Finance Ministry in Italy. 
Neither seems capable, and in fact neither has tried to understand, that we are not dealing with a zero some gain. 
The Two Faces of Berlusconi 
Silvio Berlusconi has endured a bumpy first month of his six-month presidency of the EU. 
Much of Europe is getting its first close look at Italy's billionaire Prime Minister, and many do not like what they see. 
But Europe should look beyond Berlusconi's careless tongue when gauging the nature of his regime. 
Sadly for Italy, Premier Berlusconi turned out to have two reform agendas. 
One is focused on his own judicial and economic interests (call this his ``personal reform'' program), much of which he has pursued and implemented ruthlessly. 
The other, ``general reform'' agenda, has attracted scarcely any of his energy, and seems unlikely to do so. 
Finally, a law grants immunity from prosecution to the five highest state officials, including, obviously, the Prime Minister. 
Berlusconi has been equally active in pushing reforms that serve his economic interests. 
The Chamber of Deputies is poised to enact a law only the White Queen in Alice in Wonderland could love. 
More worrying is a proposed law that strengthens the oligopolistic power of Berlusconi's television and advertising corporations while weakening the public television service. 
But such energy and commitment is utterly lacking where Berlusconi's wider reform agenda is concerned. 
For example, the government sought to amend Article 18 of the ``Workers' Statute,'' which compels big firms to reinstate workers dismissed without ``just cause.'' 
It sought this change because it believed firms would not hire people they could never fire. 
Massive industrial action forced the government to back down. 
Now it says that such a reform is neither urgent nor necessary. 
The government pledged to reduce the tax burden by about 10% of GDP. 
On the contrary, state and local taxes actually increased over the past year. 
Finally, the Northern League demands that fiscal federalism should be the main goal of reform. 
Bossi now knows that the first two promises cannot be kept. 
So he must deliver on the third, or the League will be gravely wounded. 
The schisms within the ruling coalition could be overcome if Berlusconi had the strength to distribute the costs and benefits of reform among its member parties. 
But Berlusconi's leadership is based on his skill as a communicator (which declines as expectations go unfulfilled) more than on his skill as a mediator among squabbling allies. 
The Two Faces of Vladimir Putin 
Russia’s split personality – symbolized by its Tsarist coat of arms, a two-headed eagle – has been on open display recently. 
But, like any muddle, it is succeeding only in confusing Russians about themselves and their country. 
Strangely, Putin seems as trapped by this muddle as everybody else. 
At times, Putin truly sees himself as a “modernizer” seeking to root Russia in the West. 
At other times, like Stalin, he believes that Russia’s power requires a strong hand – what he calls his “dictatorship of law.” 
The problem, as Khodorkovsky’s conviction demonstrated, is that dictatorship usually seems to be trumping law. 
Indeed, Putin’s signature characteristic is to be all men for all Russia’s people. 
Instead, the extremes seem to be squeezing out the desire for modernization. 
High oil prices now seem to be the only factor allowing Putin to keep the reform charade going. 
Alexander's formula is also popular today with Putin’s nationalists in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
He worked to strengthen and modernize Russia’s armed forces while avoiding armed conflict. 
He became known as “The Peasants’ Tsar,” though he didn’t tolerate any opposition thinking contrary to his own. 
Putin sees his own crusade to save Russia from disintegration and separatism as similar to Alexander’s. 
But how forward-looking is it to model a twenty-first-century country on the absolutist example of the past? 
Stalin is yet another cherished role model. 
Can we really compare the degree of evil of these two men? 
But the old ideas, the mimicry and symbols Putin employs to achieve his goals, no longer correspond to today’s realities or Russia’s present capabilities. 
Previously, it was Russia’s Western mission that was pure Potemkin village. 
Now Russianness itself seems to lack a secure foundation, for it is but a hollow shell of discarded state symbols. 
Like a bad driver, a nation that looks left and right but never ahead is bound to crash. 
The Tyranny of King Cotton 
Americans like to think that if poor countries simply open up their markets, greater prosperity will follow. 
Unfortunately, where agriculture is concerned, this is mere rhetoric. 
Subsidies hurt developing country farmers because they lead to higher output – and lower global prices. 
Cotton illustrates the problem. 
Without subsidies, it would not pay for Americans to produce much cotton; with them, the US is the world’s largest cotton exporter. 
The increased supply depresses cotton prices, hurting some 10 million farmers in sub-Saharan Africa alone. 
Seldom have so few done so much damage to so many. 
That damage is all the greater when we consider how America’s trade subsidies contributed to the demise of the Doha Round. 
Owing to its huge subsidies, America exports cotton, and it would import little even if formal barriers are removed. 
Thus, recent trade negotiations have a surreal air about them, because, whatever their outcome, ultimately cotton subsidies will have to go. 
But these attempts will almost surely fail; in the end – though it may take years – cotton subsidies will be eliminated. 
While export subsidies appear more obviously “trade distorting,” America’s cotton and other subsidies are in fact almost as bad. 
America and other advanced countries are the real losers from the demise of the Doha Round. 
Americans would have been better off as consumers, too, with increased access to a variety of low-cost goods from poor countries. 
A fair trade regime would have helped reduce that disparity. 
For we all suffer from the political instability to which such despair gives rise. 
But it is America that perhaps now stands to gain the most by reviving the Doha talks with a more credible and generous offer. 
America’s national interests thus dictate a change of policy. 
But there is also another powerful rationale for doing so: treating fairly those who are poorer and less powerful is the morally right thing to do. 
The Ultimate Computer 
Such advances in the processing speed and storage capacity of computers are expected to continue until the laws of physics impose certain limits. 
After all, we cannot shrink atoms or increase the speed of light. 
Now, imagine a computer technology that eventually approaches these limits. 
Imagine further that every star in every galaxy in the observable universe could somehow be fashioned into computers of this ``ultimate'' type. 
That would be a lot of very fast computers. 
Or if they were connected together we could think of them as a single, massively parallel computer: call it the ``Universe Computer.'' 
Hold that thought. 
For example, it implies that elementary particles, rather than being located at one position at a time, travel on several trajectories simultaneously. 
Among the tasks for which quantum computing would be ideally suited are ``algorithmic searches.'' 
Trying a million possibilities requires a million times as many operations. 
But our ordinary common sense does not apply in fundamental physics. 
What would happen inside a quantum computer when it performs an algorithmic search? 
The unseemly truth is that most physicists are perplexed and embarrassed by this question. 
Many explain away quantum phenomena with weasel words, or worse, they simply eschew explanation altogether. 
True, quantum phenomena cannot be observed directly. 
But we can deduce their existence and attributes by measuring their effects on things that are directly observable. 
A growing minority of physicists, myself included, accept the ``many universes'' interpretation of quantum mechanics. 
To us, no mystery exists in quantum computation, only wonder. 
The equations of quantum theory describe this phenomenon step by step. 
Direct communication between universes is, for example, ruled out. 
In fact, only a handful of potentially useful quantum algorithms are known at present. 
Grover's algorithm is one. 
Other known quantum algorithms will easily be able to crack the most widely used secure cryptographic systems of today. 
Quantum cryptography happens to be relatively easy to implement. 
The astonishing answer is that virtually any interaction between two information-carrying entities, including atoms or elementary particles, will do. 
As the physicist Seth Lloyd commented, ``almost anything becomes a computer if you shine the right kind of light on it.'' 
It turns out that existing computers, or even the imaginary ``Universe Computer,'' are not the ones. 
But a general-purpose quantum computer would be. 
In quantum physics, this ``computational universality'' is part of the essence of all matter - and thus of the comprehensibility of nature. 
No other branch of physics involves such wide-ranging interaction between theory, experiment, technology, and philosophy. 
No other field of scientific research holds more promising implications for our understanding of the universe. 
The Ultimate Nuclear Test 
This helps to explain why we are seeing new demands to start good-faith negotiations on nuclear disarmament, as has long been required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made a persuasive case for work to begin on a nuclear-weapons convention, or a framework of separate agreements resulting in a global ban. 
Even the leaders of the nuclear-weapon states are now officially supporting the goal of global nuclear disarmament. 
They are joined by former statesmen, national parliaments and regional organizations, mayors, retired military experts, women’s organizations, human rights activists, environmentalists, and countless other groups worldwide. 
Yes, nuclear disarmament has gone viral. 
It is now mainstream – a fitting subject for even die-hard realists to consider and no longer a cause promoted by peace groups alone. 
Achieving global nuclear disarmament will surely require new legal obligations for all states, nuclear and non-nuclear. 
To be blunt, the rule of law must be brought to disarmament. 
Commitments in this sensitive field must be made irreversible and subject to strict verification. 
These tasks cannot be accomplished unilaterally – multilateral cooperation is indispensable. 
Early ratification of the US-Russia START treaty would be a step in the right direction. 
Yet other advances of the rule of law in nuclear disarmament will require cooperation on a global scale. 
The CTBT has now been signed by 182 states and will enter into force after being ratified by nine more: China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and the US, while Indonesia has announced it will ratify it soon. 
This ban on nuclear tests will be backed up with a verification regime that spans the globe. 
Even today, thanks to a variety of sophisticated means, we can detect very small nuclear tests in remote locations. 
The treaty is also fair—it includes the same rights and responsibilities for all its parties. 
It sets a new standard for nuclear weapons treaty obligations and verification. 
The CTBT is needed because of the role of nuclear tests in the development and improvement of nuclear weapons. 
Such tests are also political symbols that have no place in a world determined to eliminate these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction. 
On an issue as important as this, voluntary promises not to test are simply not enough. 
Other treaties are needed as well, especially one outlawing the production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons. 
We believe that non-nuclear-weapon states also deserve legally binding assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons. 
This would be perhaps the greatest legacy we could leave for future generations. 
The UN Heresy 
No other organization is held in such respect as the United Nations. 
This is perhaps natural, for the UN embodies some of humanity's noblest dreams. 
Not since Dag Hammarskjöld has a UN leader been as acclaimed as Annan. 
Up to a point, this is understandable. 
Annan usually maintains an unruffled, dignified demeanor. 
He has charm and - many say - charisma. 
But a leader ought to be judged by his or her actions when important matters are at stake. 
Annan's failures in such situations are almost invariably glossed over. 
Between 1993 and 1996, Annan was Assistant Secretary-General for UN Peacekeeping Operations and then Under-Secretary-General. 
In 1993, Bosnia's Muslems were promised that UN forces would protect them. 
This commitment was a precondition of their consenting to disarm. 
The UN declared Srebrenica a "safe haven" to be "protected" by 600 Dutch UN troops. 
In July 1995, Serb forces attacked. 
The UN did not honor its pledge. 
Annan's staff released evasive, confused statements. 
Oblivious, apparently, to the dreadfulness of the situation, they failed to sound the alarm properly and did nothing to intervene. 
The Dutch fired not a single shot. 
NATO air power could have halted the Serbs, but Annan did not ask for NATO intervention. 
UN forces in Rwanda in 1994 were Annan's responsibility before and during the crisis. 
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning "anti-Tutsi extermination." 
He identified his source "a Hutu" and reported that arms were ready for the impending ethnic cleansing. 
Dallaire requested permission to evacuate his informant and to seize the arms cache. 
One might think Annan far too compromised for the post of Secretary-General, but the UN doesn't work that way. 
Instead of being forced to resign after Rwanda and Srebrenica, he was promoted to Secretary-General. 
Even subsequent revelations about Annan's responsibility for the disasters in Rwanda and Bosnia did not affect his standing. 
On the contrary, he was unanimously re-elected and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
He is the all-time Teflon diplomat. 
The media sometimes ratchets up admiration for Annan by pointing out that his wife is Swedish and a close relative of Raoul Wallenberg. 
But Wallenberg's name should make us even more dismayed about Annan's record. 
Wallenberg refused to ignore the threat of massacres to come. 
He never allowed himself to be duped by Hitler's cronies. 
Perhaps no one's achievement should be judged by comparison with that of Wallenberg - a titan of strength, courage, and perseverance. 
The trouble with Annan is that, when similar perils loomed, he proved especially wanting. 
Annan had at his disposal all of the instruments of power and opinion that Wallenberg lacked. 
That is both because of who Annan is and what the UN has become: an institution in which no shortcoming, it seems, goes unrewarded. 
The UN’s Mandate Gap 
If only those member states who claim to be the UN’s biggest supporters put their money where their mouths are. 
Many world leaders, particularly those in Europe, decry the Bush administration’s undermining of the UN, especially since 2003. 
But Europe’s response, like the US response in other cases, highlights a critical issue for all supporters of the UN and international institutions more generally. 
UN Security Council Resolution 1701 “calls for Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire.” 
But ROEs are only the symptom of a deeper problem. 
The real issue is a yawning gap between paper and practice. 
In the heat of an international crisis, the Security Council passes resolutions to great public fanfare, establishing an official UN “mandate.” 
In the overwhelming majority of cases, those resources fall far short of what is required to successfully intervene in a crisis. 
It’s political theater - big headlines, small results. 
The UN’s experience in Lebanon is not encouraging. 
This is a Herculean task. 
But over a month after the resolution, barely 5,000 troops are deployed. 
Even if all 15,000 UN troops could be found and deployed, the challenges in Lebanon will remain daunting. 
Instead, the job falls to the Lebanese government and armed forces, who need all the help they can get from the international community. 
That is only the military aspect of the peacekeeping effort. 
Lebanon’s infrastructure – especially in the south – has been decimated. 
Homes and livelihoods have been destroyed. 
Who will build or re-build hospitals? 
How will communications infrastructure be rebuilt? 
Who will repair Lebanon’s bridges and roads? 
The UN provides the mechanism for a global response, but as Kofi Annan often repeats, it does not exist apart from its member states. 
It is up to those members – to all of our governments - to provide both the necessary will and the required resources. 
Otherwise the UN is nothing more than a handy mechanism for outsourcing political blame. 
The world gets what it pays for. 
The UN Takes Charge 
The downturn in the US began with a failure in the financial system, which quickly was translated into a slowdown in the real economy. 
As a result, even countries with good regulatory systems are now confronting problems in their financial sectors. 
One might have thought that the United States would have taken a leadership role, since the crisis was made there. 
One might have hoped that America would be the first to offer large amounts of money to help the many innocent victims of the policies it had championed. 
But it did not, and Obama had to fight hard to extract even limited amounts for the International Monetary Fund from a reluctant Congress. 
But many developing countries have just emerged from being overburdened with debt; they do not want to go through that again. 
The implication is that they need grants, not loans. 
The build-up of reserves contributes to global imbalances and insufficient global aggregate demand, as countries put aside hundreds of billions of dollars as a precaution against global volatility. Not surprisingly, America, which benefits by getting trillions of dollars of loans from developing countries – now at almost no interest – was not enthusiastic about the discussion. 
On the last day of the conference, as America was expressing its reservations about even discussing at the UN this issue which affects all countries’ well being, China was once again reiterating that the time had come to begin working on a global reserve currency. 
The US and other advanced industrial countries pushed globalization. 
But this crisis has shown that they have not managed globalization as well as they should have. 
If globalization is to work for everyone, decisions about how to manage it must be made in a democratic and inclusive manner – with the participation of both the perpetrators and the victims of the mistakes. 
This UN conference, like an earlier one on financing for developing countries, demonstrated the key role that the UN must play in any global discussion about reforming the global financial and economic system. 
The Unaccountable G-8 
So let’s make our own account of how the G-8 did. 
The answer, alas, is a failing grade. 
The G-8 this year illustrates the difference between photo-ops and serious global governance. 
The G-8 promised that, by this year, it would increase annual development assistance to the world’s poor by $50 billion relative to 2004. 
Half of the increase, or $25 billion per year, would go to Africa. 
The G-8 fell far short of this goal, especially with respect to Africa. 
The properly measured shortfall is even greater, because the promises that were made in 2005 should be adjusted for inflation. 
Re-stating those commitments in real terms, total aid should have risen by around $60 billion, and aid to Africa should have risen by around $30 billion. 
In effect, the G-8 fulfilled only half of its promise to Africa – roughly $15 billion in increased aid rather than $30 billion. 
Much of the overall G-8 increase in aid went to Iraq and Afghanistan, as part of the US-led war effort, rather than to Africa. 
Among G-8 countries, only the UK is making a bold effort to increase its overall aid budget and direct a significant portion to Africa. 
In fact, the G-8 displayed two approaches. 
Second, the G-8 Summit communiqué simply did not mention the unmet commitments at all. 
The G-8 did not fail because of the current financial crisis. 
Even before the crisis, the G-8 countries were not taking serious steps to meet their pledges to Africa. 
But isn’t this what politicians like to do – smile for the cameras, and then fail to honor their promises? 
I would say that the situation is far more serious than that. 
Second, the emptiness of G-8 leaders’ words puts the world at risk. 
They promised to fight climate change with $30 billion of new emergency funds, but so far they are not delivering. 
My own country, the US, shows the largest gap between promises and reality. 
Hosting this year’s G-8 summit reportedly cost Canada a fortune, despite the absence of any significant results. 
This is essentially the same amount that the G-8 leaders pledged to give each year to the world’s poorest countries to support maternal and child health. 
But it is tragic to spend so much money and then accomplish next to nothing in terms of concrete results and honest accountability. 
There are three lessons to be drawn from this sorry episode. 
First, the G-8 as a group should be brought to an end. 
The G-20, which includes developing countries as well as rich countries, should take over. 
Second, any future promises made by the G-20 should be accompanied by a clear and transparent accounting of what each country will do, and when. 
The world needs true accountability, not empty words about accountability. 
Every G-20 promise should spell out the specific actions and commitments of each country, as well as the overall promise of the group. 
The G-20 meets later this year in South Korea, a country that has emerged from poverty and hunger over the past 50 years. 
South Korea understands the utter seriousness of the global development agenda, and the poorest countries’ needs. 
Our best hope is that South Korea will succeed as the next host country, picking up where Canada has fallen far short. 
The Unbearable Lightness of Change 
MADRID – Barack Obama’s first year in office has been a sobering exercise in the limits of presidential power. 
It also carries lessons about how the resilient and impersonal forces of history can constrain any leader’s drive for change. 
Obama’s current “winter of discontent” genuinely reflects the mixed record of his first year. 
The Massachusetts electoral debacle only highlighted the growing rift between the president’s agenda and popular sensibilities. 
Admittedly, Obama inherited a collapsing financial system, a declining world order, and the ever-present threat of global terrorism. 
The president’s domestic agenda is bold and revolutionary, but it clashes frontally with the most fundamental tenets of America’s liberal and individualistic ethos. 
Obama’s priorities in foreign policy are definitely sound. 
But creating a structure of international relations that will make a more stable and enduring world order is not a task to be completed within one year. 
Iraq is showing some positive signs of political and institutional recovery, but the omens for the future remain, in Obama’s own words, “messy.” 
A man of peace, Obama has become no less a war president than his predecessor. 
Having seen the harsh realities of the world as it really is , he has become the champion of the “just war.” 
The solution is ultimately political, not military. 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was right to recognize that the Taliban are “part of the political fabric” of Afghanistan and thus “need to participate in the country’s government.” 
But this might not be achieved without involving the major regional stakeholders, including Pakistan, China, and possibly Iran. 
The Obama administration’s failure in re-launching the India-Pakistan peace talks over Kashmir is one of the gravest weaknesses of its “AfPak” strategy. 
Obama’s administration will not start a war with a third Muslim country while the two others continue to burn. 
Iran might eventually turn into the graveyard of Obama’s dream of a world without nuclear weapons. 
George Bernard Shaw once observed that “in the arts of peace Man is a bungler.” 
He was commendably humble to admit that he was wrong “to have raised expectations so high.” 
Yet he continues to be the greatest promise for a better world that this political generation can offer. 
And he still has time to vindicate Woodrow Wilson’s belief that a “president can be just as big a man as he chooses to be.” 
The Japanese Experiment 
But, while debate naturally focuses on Japan’s economic, financial, and political maneuvers, the tipping point could well lie abroad. 
To demonstrate their seriousness, Japanese officials moved quickly to commit to measurable metrics. 
Already, financial markets have responded with alacrity. 
The Japanese equity market is up an impressive 55% since hints of the paradigm shift started hitting investors’ radar screens. 
At the same time, the Japanese yen has depreciated sharply, including by more than 20% against the struggling euro. 
This response is part of the transmission mechanism for the Japanese government’s policies. 
The surge in the stock market benefits domestic investors, making them likelier to spend more (what economists call the “wealth effect”). 
This, in turn, should revive corporate “animal spirits,” leading to higher investment in new plants and equipment, together with higher wages and salaries. 
Japan’s aging population mutes the potential impact of both the wealth effect and animal spirits. 
Resource flexibility is lower than in the US. 
Interest rates are already low. 
The experience of deflation is well entrenched. 
And, given Japan’s high level of public indebtedness, the risks of collateral damage and unintended consequences are potentially higher. 
This does not mean that Japan’s policy revolution will necessarily disappoint. 
Meeting the first condition is in the hands of Japanese citizens and their elected representatives. 
The second requirement is very different. 
But will the rest of the world accommodate Japan’s bold policy experiment, or will it take protective steps and thus impede the operation of a crucial policy transmission mechanism? 
While initial indications are encouraging, the jury is still out. 
Japan’s policy change was big and abrupt, and several of the countries on the receiving end have been focused on complex domestic challenges. 
A few countries – particularly Brazil, China, and South Korea – have noticed. 
It is just a matter of time until the rest of the world catches up with the reality of how Japan’s experiment affects them. 
In other words, a growing pie for all better accommodates all. 
Here the risk involves currency wars and other beggar-thy-neighbor disruptions. 
There is currently insufficient data to predict either outcome confidently. 
As we await additional evidence, let us appreciate how rarely we witness, in real time, such a momentous policy shift. 
The Undeserving One Percent? 
CHICAGO – It is amazing how the “one percent” epithet, a reference to the top 1% of earners, has caught on in the United States and elsewhere in the developed world. 
In the United States, this 1% includes all those with a 2006 household income of at least $386,000. 
In the popular narrative, the 1% is thickly populated with unscrupulous corporate titans, greedy bankers, and insider-trading hedge-fund managers. 
The 1% are not people who have earned money the hard way by making real things, so there is no harm in taking it away from them. 
Clearly, this caricature is based on some truth. 
For instance, corporations, especially in the financial sector, reward too many executives richly despite mediocre performance. 
But apart from tarring too many with the same brush, there is something deeply troubling about this narrative’s reductionism. 
It ignores, for example, the fact that many of the truly rich are entrepreneurs. 
It likewise ignores the fact that many of the wealthy are sports stars and entertainers, and that their ranks include professionals such as doctors, lawyers, consultants, and even some of our favorite progressive economists. 
In other words, the rich today are more likely to be working than idle. 
Academic studies suggest that the top tenth percentile of income distribution in the US, and elsewhere, is also moving farther away from the median earner. 
This is an inconvenient fact for the progressive economist. 
“We are the 90%,” sounds less dramatic than “we are the 99%.” 
And, for some of the protesters, it may not even be true. 
Perhaps most problematic, though, is that something other than plutocrat-friendly policies is largely responsible for the growing inequality. 
That something is education and skills. True, not every degree is a passport to a job. 
Nevertheless, the unemployment rate for those with degrees is one-third the unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma. 
Technological change and global competition have made it impossible for American workers to get good jobs without strong skills. 
As Harvard professors Claudia Golden and Larry Katz put it, in the race between technology and education, education is falling behind. 
It has the inconvenient implication that the poor have a role in pulling themselves out of the morass. 
There are no easy and quick fixes to education – every US president since Gerald Ford in the mid-1970’s has called for educational reforms, with little effect. 
In contrast, blaming the undeserving 1% offers a redistributive policy agenda with immediate effects. 
The US has tried quick fixes before. 
Income inequality grew rapidly in the last decade, but consumption inequality did not. 
The reason: easy credit, especially subprime mortgages, which helped those without means to keep up with the Joneses. 
The ending, as everyone knows, was not a happy one. 
The less-well-off ultimately became even worse off as they lost their jobs and homes. 
The US needs to improve the quality of its workforce by developing the skills that are relevant to the jobs that its firms are creating. 
None of this is easy or likely to produce results quickly, and some of it may require more resources. 
While eliminating inefficient spending, especially inefficient tax subsidies, can generate some of these funds, more tax revenues may be needed. 
The Unended Recessional 
Zimbabwe's crisis has incited an unsettling feeling of déja vu . 
The imperial statues are toppled, cities and streets renamed, the vestiges of foreign rule either abandoned or adapted. 
That great staple of political rhetoric appears to have been buried across the developing world. 
Internationally, colonialism is even more passé. 
That theme has died out in diplomatic discourse. 
The events in East Timor in 1999 remain fresh in memory, and difficulties linger. 
But at least closure seems in sight, unlike those messy legacies of European colonialism: Western Sahara, Cyprus, and Palestine. 
But not only the direct results of colonialism remain relevant: the indirect ones also matter. 
The intellectual history of colonialism is littered with many a willful cause of recent conflict. 
Such distinctions were not merely pernicious; they were often characterized by an unequal distribution of the resources of the state within a colonial society. 
Belgian colonialists favored Tutsis, leading to Hutu rejection of them as alien interlopers; 
A ``mixed'' colonial history within one modern state is also a potential source of danger. 
When a state has more than one colonial past, its future is vulnerable. 
The war that erupted in 1991 in no small measure pitted those parts that had been ruled by the German-speaking empires against those that avoided such colonization. 
Boundaries drawn in colonial times, even if unchanged after independence, still create problems, especially in Africa. 
Where colonial constructions force disparate peoples together by the arbitrariness of a colonial map-maker's pen, nationhood becomes elusive. 
State failure in the wake of colonialism is another source of conflict. 
Underdevelopment in post-colonial societies itself causes conflict. 
This is not to say that our responses to the dangers emerging from the legacies of the past must be rooted in the past. 
There is a greater need than ever before for innovative, forward-looking approaches to global governance. 
I have no wish to give politicians in post-colonial countries whose leadership has been found wanting any reason to find excuses in the past for their own failures. 
But in looking to understand possible future sources of conflict, the best crystal ball may be a rear-view mirror. 
Austerity’s Children 
WASHINGTON, DC – When economists discuss “fiscal adjustment,” they typically frame it as an abstract and complex goal. 
But the issue is actually simple: Who will bear the brunt of measures to reduce the budget deficit? 
Either taxes have to go up for some people, or spending must fall – or both. 
“Fiscal adjustment” is jargon; what austerity is always about is the distribution of income. 
Much of Europe is already aware of this, of course. 
Now it’s America’s turn. 
For example, the current budget sequester (that is, across-the-board spending cuts) is already hurting programs like Head Start, which supports pre-school education. 
The segment is hilarious, but also sad, because the impact on some people’s lives is very real. 
Around 70,000 children are likely to lose access to Head Start on our current fiscal course. 
And much larger cuts are in store for early-childhood nutrition programs and health care. 
Perhaps most shocking are the dramatic cuts to the Medicaid health-insurance program that the House of Representatives’ Republican majority have embraced in their latest budget proposal. 
Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, proposes to balance the budget over the next 10 years largely by slashing the program. 
About half of all people covered by Medicaid are children. 
Is it fair to force low-income children to bear the burden of fiscal adjustment? 
The top 1% captured 62% of all income growth over this period, partly owing to a sharp rise in returns to higher education in recent decades. 
(On average, those with only a high school education or less have few good income prospects.) 
Many of these decisions turned out badly, largely because information technology (computers and how they are used) eliminated many middle-class jobs. 
Increasing globalization of trade also did not help in this regard. 
Children whose families cannot provide a decent start in life deserve help. 
But America has not provided it – a point recently made by Jeb Bush, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. 
Nor is America likely to provide such help in the future, given the coming budget cuts’ disproportionate impact on children at the lower end of the income distribution. 
America can easily afford to do better, of course. 
Today’s children did not play a role in any of these policy mistakes. 
The preschoolers who are about to lose access to Head Start weren’t even born when they were made. 
Imposing austerity on poor children is not just unfair; it is also bad economics. 
When economists, again with their dry jargon, talk about a country’s “human capital,” what they really mean is the cognitive and physical abilities of its people. 
Unfortunately, no one in a position of power is likely to heed such arguments. 
They should. 
The Unfinished Cold War 
MOSCOW – This November will mark the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
But the end of confrontation in Europe may be proving only temporary. 
One year after last summer’s war in Georgia, old divisions seem to be re-emerging in a different form. 
Although the Cold War in Europe was declared over, the truth is, it never really finished. 
Our hope was for unification with Europe, a “common European home,” and the creation of a Europe “united and free.” 
Our hopes were not starry-eyed self-deception. 
After all, the leaders of the United States and Germany had promised Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand eastward. 
At first, after they had vanquished communism, Russians regarded themselves as victors. 
But, after a few euphoric years, the West began acting more and more like the Cold War’s winners. 
At first, NATO’s new members were declared to have met both democratic and military criteria. 
Later, these criteria were abandoned when NATO began to invite even the most backward and corrupt states to join. 
Moreover, NATO enlargement has meant that Europe itself has still not emerged from the Cold War. 
No peace treaty ended the Cold War, so it remains unfinished. 
For the time being, the situation remains open. 
It is my hope that the global economic crisis and Barack Obama’s presidency will put the farcical idea of a new Cold War into proper perspective. 
Countries not included in any of the current security systems would be able to join in the treaty and receive multilateral guarantees. 
NATO enlargement would de facto be frozen. 
With the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in mind, we must seek to prevent the further fragmentation of states, and also their forcible reunification. 
Kosovo, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia must be the last of the states that break away through force. 
The “Pandora’s box” of self-determination must be closed. 
In this scenario, Russian-US cooperation in crisis situations like Afghanistan, or in countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, would become much more profound. 
Europe, Russia, and the US must finish the “unfinished war.” 
Then, perhaps in 2019, the year that will mark the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, we may finally bid farewell to the twentieth century. 
DNA at 60 
But, 60 years later, has their discovery really had the transformative impact that the world expected? 
The British newspaper The Guardian featured the headline, “Happy Birthday, DNA! 
The golden moment that changed us all.” 
To some extent, they are right. 
Likewise, it has facilitated important innovations, such as pharmacogenetic cancer treatment, in which drugs target specific genetic defects within cancer cells. 
Moreover, DNA has acquired a certain mystique in popular culture. 
According to Dorothy Nelkin and Susan Lindee, it has become a sacred entity – the modern equivalent of the Christian soul, an individual’s essence. 
“We will have extra limbs, if we want them,” he asserted, “maybe even wings to fly.” 
Thirteen years later, Gee’s prediction looks increasingly unlikely, with the Human Genome Project so far having failed to meet expectations. 
For example, a 12-year study of 19,000 white American women found that 101 genetic markers that had been statistically linked to heart disease had no predictive value. 
Self-reported family histories, by contrast, proved very accurate in predicting the disease. 
In fact, most diseases are not caused by single genes. 
As a result, after a few early successes with atypical single-gene disorders such as Huntington’s disease, progress has stalled. 
Common variants typically explain a small fraction of genetic risk. 
Genetics has been a source of particularly high hopes when it comes to cancer treatment. 
An understanding of the genetic determinants of patients’ therapeutic response, it was believed, would enable doctors to develop individualized treatment programs, sparing more responsive patients from harmful overtreatment. 
But patients are not the only variable. 
Cancer, too, is heterogeneous, even in patients with the same diagnosis. 
After sequencing the entire genomes of 50 patients’ breast cancer tumors, researchers found that only 10% of the tumors had more than three mutations in common. 
According to a recent study mapping genetic mutations in 2,000 tumors, breast cancer can actually be divided into ten subgroups. 
Similarly, a genome-wide analysis of malignant cells from four kidney-cancer patients showed that, while they were related, they had mutated in many different directions. 
Two-thirds of the genetic faults identified were not repeated in the same tumor, let alone in any other metastasized tumors in the body. 
Given that a pharmacogenetic drug targets one mutation in the tumor, it will not necessarily work on the other mutations. 
In addition, as the cancer adjusts to the drug, further mutations are likely to occur, diminishing the drug’s efficacy. 
To be sure, pharmacogenetics has made a profound difference for some patients. 
Barbara Bradfield, one of the original subjects in research trials for the pharmacogenetic cancer drug Herceptin, has now been stable on the drug for more than 20 years. 
But such success stories are far too rare to constitute a “golden age” of genetics. 
The high price of such drugs is limiting their impact as well. 
Herceptin can cost up to $40,000 annually, and newer cancer drugs cost even more, making them prohibitively expensive for most patients. 
The US Supreme Court is currently faced with the question of whether genes can be patented. 
Women have already been denied access to a diagnostic test, because insurers refuse to pay the company’s high prices. 
Manufacturers claim that gene patents, which now cover 25-40% of the human genome, are vital to recouping their investments. 
The Ungreening of the World 
The landscape has been permanently altered. 
When you imagine Greece, Italy, and Iraq, it is likely that you imagine a dry landscape with open views, the way they look today. 
Historical records indicate, however, that these places were once covered by dense forests. 
The forests fell as civilizations flourished, so the earlier a place became “civilized” the sooner it became deforested. 
So today we sit on a planet with only 50% of its forest cover remaining. 
And here’s the part that should bring tears to your eyes: we continue to lose more forest cover every year. 
The more recent losses are well documented. 
Every five years the United Nations produces a summary report called the Global Forest Resource Assessment; 
The team in charge of assembling the assessment relies on internet reporting and satellite surveillance to come up with the figures. 
The next report is due to be released in 2010. 
I will not be surprised when it is released and I read that the global forest area has continued to shrink. 
If this happens when we claim to love trees, I shudder to think what would happen if we were ambivalent about them? 
Or thought we could live without them? 
In the United States, deforestation began as soon as the colonies were settled. 
By 1920, more than three-quarters of the US’s original forests had been cut. 
Similar to the global figures, today the US has only half the forest cover that it had in 1600. 
And we continue to destroy forest land. 
At the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro it was agreed that, “efforts should be undertaken towards the greening of the world.” 
Last week, I went to a zoning meeting in the town where I live. 
A real estate housing project developer wanted to cut many acres of trees so he could build houses. 
That forest land will be lost, probably forever, and a few more numbers will be added to the global deforestation total next year. 
Why do local politicians, tree lovers all, allow yet more forest destruction? 
Why do humans all claim to love trees, but their actions deny their claim? 
I think it has to do with fear. 
But we do not fear trees. 
We do not fear their retaliation. 
Trees stand mute despite our betrayal. 
Perhaps that is one of the reasons we really love them. 
But if we want to do more than love them, if we want to save them, we must become fearless. 
The Unilateral Road to Peace 
Certainly, according to Sharon’s thinking, there is no future for 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. 
Hence, in the absence of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only meaningful step towards de-escalation and stabilization. 
This policy has deeply divided Israel: the settlers – mostly, but not exclusively religious – feel betrayed by Sharon, “The Father of the Settlements.” 
Like de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has reshuffled the cards of Israel’s politics. 
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions. 
This forcible approach is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis. 
Only the next days and weeks will tell whether the evacuation proceeds peacefully or not. 
In the meantime, Sharon has paid heavily for his policies. 
Only by bringing Shimon Peres’s Labor Party into his cabinet did Sharon manage to retain his parliamentary majority. 
The question, of course, is what will happen after the Gaza disengagement. 
This is a major mistake. 
While motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality. 
To attempt negotiations under these circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility, but may merely deepen alienation and suspicion on both sides. 
So what can be done? 
Probably the only rational way to proceed would be to acknowledge that unilateral steps on both sides can still further the cause of de-escalation and ultimate reconciliation. 
On the Palestinian side, consolidation of the Palestinian Authority’s control over a dozen security services and militias would be an important step. 
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, recognizes this, but the question is whether he can deliver. 
In an ideal world, conflicts end by agreements and treaties. 
In the absence of plausible alternatives, one hopes that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians. 
The Union and the Dragon 
This month, China and the European Union mark 30 years of official relations. 
During that period, changes within China, and in the nature of those relations, have been dramatic. 
But how will relations evolve over the next thirty years? 
Will China and the EU be competitors or partners? 
Many challenges face both China and the EU. 
The first are economic. 
China’s development in recent years has been magnificent. 
But speedy growth always incites turbulence, which China will have to minimize and manage. 
As it integrates into the world economy, it must seek to sustain growth while protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality. 
These are daunting tasks, and China cannot address them alone. 
Indeed, sustainable development is a challenge for both China and Europe. 
A recent UN report warned that we have already entered the danger zone. 
Numerous land and sea ecosystems are in danger of being destroyed forever, with effects that are hard to predict. 
One downside to China’s rapid growth is its rising demand for energy and the increased CO2 emissions that accompany it. 
China is quickly turning into one of the world’s largest importers of oil and gas. 
Huge investments – worth trillions of euros – will be needed to meet global energy requirements. 
The same report warns that, if we do not change our ways, worldwide CO2 emissions will rise exponentially. 
So a new phase in international environmental cooperation is needed, with China’s active contribution. 
Of course, China clearly has a right – like any country – to seek the energy, minerals, and other resources it needs. 
But a lack of cooperation could result in higher-than-necessary oil and gas prices and perhaps defeat in the battle against climate change. 
This means that China must treat climate change and intelligent energy use as priorities in its national policies. 
Beyond economics, China must reassure others that its awakening will not make the world tremble. 
Thus, in formulating its policies, China must also sell those policies to a global audience. 
Most Europeans believe that China wants to be a shaper of – not a challenger to – a balanced world order, a strong United Nations, and an effective multilateral system. 
But, in a global village, misperceptions can arise all too easily – and can do great damage. 
China’s important role concerning North Korea’s nuclear ambitions is a good example of exercising responsibility for international security and stability. 
The international community counts on China to pursue that role with vigor. 
If necessary, it must use its influence even more assertively to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table. 
Obviously, that solution must be in line with Chinese proposals and interests: a denuclearized Korean peninsula, which has the support of the EU. 
Opportunities exist for a constructive Chinese role elsewhere. 
This is not just about Iran, but also about the threat of a nuclear arms race across the entire Middle East. 
Chinese interests are served by a Middle East marked by regional cooperation. 
We count on China’s continued support for European and American efforts in making sure that Iran’s nuclear program remains limited to purely civilian purposes. 
Europe and the world are also watching China’s handling of domestic human rights issues. 
The EU welcomed the inclusion last year of the following clause in the Chinese Constitution: “The government respects and protects the human rights of the people.” 
But it is deeds that matter. 
At the EU-China Summit, we discussed the Chinese government’s plans for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
One subject China should address is freedom of belief. 
The obligation of prior registration of religious communities is discriminatory. 
It is time to replace the old cooperation agreement between the Union and China, dating from 1985. 
Our relationship has evolved from a predominantly economic one into one that includes fighting terrorism, piracy, and organized crime, as well as many other issues. 
A structured dialogue – including the private sector, which is so intimately involved in China’s development – is needed on energy, sustainable development, and the environment. 
We must see environmental problems and energy scarcity for what they are: threats to mankind as a whole. 
China will undoubtedly find the EU a tough negotiating partner. 
The EU sets all kinds of conditions for cooperation with other countries. 
Some issues are non-negotiable, because they are pillars of the European model that we seek to share with the world. 
These include democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and the environment, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and the campaign against terrorism. 
The EU’s political standards are high, but the fruits of cooperation are sweet. 
If we tackle our common problems together, China and Europe can be instrumental in turning the twenty-first century into a century of hope. 
The United States and the Test Ban Treaty 
America’s allies and adversaries alike are looking for evidence of continuity or change in the new president’s approach. 
One key test will be the new administration’s actions on nuclear nonproliferation in general and on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in particular. 
A year ago, President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright asked me to serve as their Special Advisor for the Test Ban Treaty. 
The US Senate had recently voted against the Treaty’s ratification. 
I listened to their concerns and sought their suggestions. 
I hope that the Bush administration will revisit the Treaty in the context of its importance to combating the spread of nuclear weapons. 
This week, I submitted to President Clinton a series of recommendations that may help the incoming administration give favorable consideration to revisiting the Treaty. 
Although too numerous to list here, the broad objectives of these recommendations are to: 
· Increase bipartisan and allied support for a carefully coordinated comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation program; 
· Enhance US capabilities to detect and deter nuclear testing and other aspects of nuclear proliferation; 
· Improve the management of potential risks associated with the long-term reliability and safety of the US nuclear deterrent; 
America recognizes that it has a deep responsibility to join with like-minded nations in leading global nonproliferation efforts. 
US leadership is essential to the success here, as is the Test Ban Treaty. 
Banning nuclear tests contributes to an effective nonproliferation policy predicated on the skillful use of a variety of political, diplomatic and economic responses to proliferation problems. 
It helps to constrain further development and proliferation of advanced nuclear weapons and strengthens political support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
The spread of nuclear weapons is unquestionably among the greatest threats to global security. 
Now more than ever, proliferation threatens to heighten regional tensions and multiply devastation should war break out. 
One need look no further than the Middle East or South Asia to see the potential for catastrophe. 
If unthinkable disasters in these and other regions are to be averted, America must exercise clear and consistent leadership to sustain global support for nonproliferation efforts. 
I am confident that this is not the case. 
These efforts should be continued by the incoming administration. 
Ultimately, this will not be enough. 
Other nations will, of course, afford the new administration time to review these issues. 
But they will soon want to see concrete signs of progress toward ratification. 
Extended delay is unlikely to be met with extended tolerance. 
If other states perceive a definite end to hopes of American ratification of the Treaty, the damage to the nonproliferation regime, over time, could be immeasurable. 
I am confident that the recommendations included in my report set forth a balanced, responsible approach to mitigating these risks without renegotiating the Treaty. 
The Universe in a Grain of Sand 
There was a flurry of press coverage when the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland was turned on, and again when it was shut down by a technical problem shortly afterwards. 
Some of the initial rumors about what could happen were extreme. 
One speculated that these new high energies, when combined with the specific way the particles would be broken, would annihilate us. 
In another scenario, the lab might create uncontrollable tiny black holes. 
In yet another, the creation of a “stranglet” would spawn new and terrible levels of nuclear power. 
There are possible risks when messing around with fundamental matter, but in this case, the shutdown was due to a mundane gas leak. 
What makes this test interesting for scientists, rather than newsmakers, is unchanged, and will still be exciting when CERN starts up the collider again. 
Here is what is at stake. 
The purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to create an unprecedented situation. 
If the predicted particle does not appear, a series of theoretical abstractions will be questioned – and become open to replacement by radically different alternatives. 
It is not generally appreciated how much real-world impact a changed scientific model can have. 
For most people, the topics that excite physicists do not seem to affect daily life in the slightest. 
But there is a deeper chain of abstractions – the tools we use to think – at work here, one based on the way we perceive reality. 
For example, consider how different the world was before the concept of “zero” was discovered. 
Zero is essential to bookkeeping and hence all modern commerce. 
And that is quite apart from the way we take for granted the idea of “nothing.” 
Similarly, what if theories using germs had not been proven? 
We wouldn’t think about information transfer or messages the same way. 
Or the concept of the force field, which enables the concept of influence? 
Freud’s original model of the mind, the successors of which since shaped how we think of ourselves, were inspired by Einstein’s theory of relativity. 
Powerful scientific abstractions eventually creep into the way we enjoy art, and how we form our laws and articulate our ethics. 
In the highly anticipated CERN experiment, the theory in question is at the center of a controversy about what abstractions seem more fundamental in the universe. 
One is based on number; the other is based on form. 
The first holds that the universe is fundamentally probabilistic, generally random but with an order to its randomness. 
The other posits that the universe is inherently geometric, and that geometric properties, such as symmetry, govern it. 
If the experiment finds the predicted particle, it will tilt the argument toward form. 
Here’s what this could mean in the long run. 
When you just read the word “symmetry,” you probably thought about two balanced halves, or a reflection. 
We extend this simple notion through all of our reasoning about the world: man and woman, boss and employee, love and hate, left and right. 
It drives our ideas of politics, religion, and even the principles of truth underpinning our system of laws. 
But what if you naturally dealt with symmetries of three? 
What if it was proven, through a particle collision, that a true balance required three sides instead of two? 
The tests in the Hadron Collider may trigger this change, every bit as disruptive as an explosion. 
Or perhaps it will be less dramatic, dawning in the mind of a clerk gazing out the window of a patent office. 
A different perception of reality has the power to change us – change the way we think – and it could come from anywhere. 
The Unknown Promise of Internet Freedom 
In liberal democracies around the world, this decision has generally been greeted with enthusiasm. 
A readers’ poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed 96% opposed to those proposed measures, and only 2% in support. 
The Internet, like the steam engine, is a technological breakthrough that changed the world. 
Remarkably, this came about with no central planning, no governing body, and no overall control, other than a system for allocating the names of Web sites and their addresses. 
That may be why so many people believe so strongly that the Internet should be left completely unfettered. 
Reality is more complex. 
The Chinese government was never going to cave in to Google’s demand that it abandon Internet censorship. 
Nevertheless, the more important point is that Google is no longer lending its imprimatur to political censorship. 
Predictably, some accuse Google of seeking to impose its own values on a foreign culture. 
Nonsense. 
Google is entitled to choose how and with whom it does business. 
One could just as easily assert that during the period in which Google filtered its results in China, China was imposing its values on Google. 
Google’s withdrawal is a decision in accordance with its own values. 
Even with censorship, the Internet is a force for change. 
A Web report critical of the governor’s behavior stayed up for 18 hours before censors ordered it taken down. 
By then, however, the news was already widely dispersed. 
Likewise, in Cuba, Yoani Sánchez’s blog Generation Yhas broken barriers that conventional media could not. 
The new freedom of expression brought by the Internet goes far beyond politics. 
We discover new things about what people want to do and how they want to connect to each other. 
Do you live in an isolated village and have unusual hobbies, special interests, or sexual preferences? 
You will find someone online with whom to share them. 
The Unraveling of Europe’s Peace 
COPENHAGEN – The European Commission recently unveiled long-awaited measures to bring neighboring countries in the Mediterranean and the former Soviet Union closer to Europe. 
Few missed the irony of formulating two plans that pointed in opposite directions. 
Attracting neighbors has long been a noble aspiration – and something of a European specialty. 
Crucially, the Commission’s recent proposals include the creation of “mobility partnerships” with Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, aimed at facilitating travel for local students and businesspeople. 
This is controversial enough: the decision is motivated by a large influx of asylum-seekers, often offering frivolous reasons, originating from Serbia. 
But visa liberalization has been the main concrete signal of Europe’s goodwill towards this neglected backyard, which dreams of joining the EU. 
Whatever this plan’s impact in practice, the political message is clear: when in doubt, Europe is better off sealing its borders. 
The same Janus-faced approach is evident in Europe’s response to the Arab Spring. 
After a lukewarm reaction to the uprisings, Europe was eager to show its support for democratic movements in the region. 
At the same time, with boatloads of migrants arriving from Tunisia, some rather drastic measures have been adopted. 
A recent dispute between Italy (the main port of arrival) and France (the principal final destination) ended with the French reintroducing border controls. 
In an unrelated move, Denmark did the same, ostensibly to prevent cross-border crime. 
But there is a clear correlation between unrest at the EU’s doorstep and Europe’s irresistible instinct to keep trouble at arm’s length. 
For once, the rot is not in Brussels, but rather in a growing number of European capitals. 
The case of Italy is instructive: “human tsunami” is the unfortunate phrase used by senior policymakers to warn against the possible flood of migrants. 
But, almost six months into the North African upheavals, the number of arrivals on the southern island of Lampedusa has reached roughly 30,000. 
By comparison, Sweden, with one-sixth the population of Italy, accepted the same number of asylum-seekers in 2009. 
Italian officials privately confirm that the current figures are not unmanageable. 
The case for openness, inclusion, and diversity in European societies has become much harder to make. 
This turn of events comes at a price. 
The genius of modern Europe has consisted in linking long-term stability to the pursuit of ever-deeper economic and political integration. 
For the past half-century, this has represented Europe’s revolutionary recipe for peace, and has served as something of a microcosm of globalization. 
The ever-freer and faster flow of capital, labor, goods, and ideas found in the EU a model and a forerunner. 
Free movement of people within Europe constitutes this visionary project’s most tangible feat. 
One unintended effect of the Arab revolutions is that the link between security and integration that forms Europe’s foundation is decoupling. 
The advantages of pooling sovereignty and resources ring increasingly hollow to ordinary Europeans. 
Governments find it more politically rewarding to pursue security by erecting administrative or physical barriers. 
As election campaigns beckon in some of the countries that are now debating immigration controls, this trend is unlikely to be reversed any time soon. 
But Europeans should make no mistake about the consequences. 
Opposing Europe now means not only standing up to an unelected behemoth in Brussels, as Euro-skeptics would have it. 
Nor is it merely about questioning the sources of Europe’s influence in a fast-changing world. 
Unraveling the nexus between security and integration means nothing less than rejecting the formula of Europe’s peace. 
Grand Mal Economics 
BERKELEY – Across the North Atlantic region, central bankers and governments seem, for the most part, helpless in restoring full employment to their economies. 
Europe has slipped back into recession without ever really recovering from the financial/sovereign-debt crisis that began in 2008. 
Such episodes are bad for everybody – workers who lose their jobs, entrepreneurs and equity holders who lose their profits, governments that lose their tax revenue, and bondholders who suffer the consequences of bankruptcy – and we have had nearly two centuries to figure out how to deal with them. 
So why have governments and central banks failed? 
There are three reasons why the authorities might fail to restore full employment rapidly after a downturn. 
For starters, unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment. That was the problem in the 1970’s, but it is not the problem now. 
And here I stop, flummoxed. 
That year, Jean-Baptiste Say published his Cours Complet d’Economie Politique Pratique, admitting that Thomas Malthus had been at least half right in arguing that an economy could suffer for years from a “general glut” of commodities, with nearly everybody trying to reduce spending below income – in today’s jargon, to deleverage. 
And, because one person’s spending is another’s income, universal deleveraging produces only depression and high unemployment. 
1. Don’t go there in the first place: avoid whatever it is – whether external pressure under the gold standard, asset-price bubbles, or leverage-and-panic cycles such as that of 2003-2009 – that creates the desire to deleverage. 
5. In the worst case, have the government step in, borrow money, and buy stuff, thereby rebalancing the economy as the private sector deleverages. 
But it is clear that they have not tried enough: the “stop” signal of unanchored inflation expectations, accelerating price growth, and spiking long-term interest rates – all of which tell us that we have reached the structural and expectational limits of expansionary policy – has not yet been flashed. 
So we remain far short of full employment for the third reason. 
And here I reflect on the 1930’s, and on how historical events recur, appearing first as tragedy and then, pace Karl Marx, as yet another tragedy. 
Keynes begged the policymakers of his time to ignore the “austere and puritanical souls” who argue for “what they politely call a ‘prolonged liquidation’ to put us right,” and professed that he could “not understand how universal bankruptcy can do any good or bring us nearer to prosperity.” 
The Unreality of the “Real” Business Cycle 
I am keen to understand what he meant. 
Since I have had no opportunity to ask him, I have to rely on his memoirs, The Age of Turbulence , for clues. 
But that book was published in 2007 – before, presumably, his intellectual structure fell apart. 
In his memoirs, Greenspan revealed that his favorite economist was Joseph Schumpeter, inventor of the concept of “creative destruction.” 
As Greenspan notes, it was the dot-com boom of the 1990’s that “finally gave broad currency to Schumpeter’s idea of creative destruction.” 
Both the phrase and his lack of action make sense in the light of his (now shattered) intellectual system. 
It is impossible to imagine a continuous gale of creative destruction taking place except in a context of boom and bust. 
Indeed, early theorists of business cycles understood this. 
(Schumpeter himself wrote a huge, largely unreadable book, with that title in 1939.) 
Such over-investment produces an inevitable collapse. 
Banks magnify the boom by making credit too easily available, and they exacerbate the bust by withdrawing it too abruptly. 
But the legacy is a more efficient stock of capital equipment. 
Dennis Robertson, an early twentieth-century “real” business-cycle theorist, wrote: “I do not feel confident that a policy which, in the pursuit of stability of prices, output, and employment, had nipped in the bud the English railway boom of the forties, or the American railway boom of 1869-71, or the German electrical boom of the nineties, would have been on balance beneficial to the populations concerned.” 
It manages to combine technology-driven cycles of booms and recessions with markets that always clear (i.e., there is no unemployment). 
How is this trick accomplished? 
When a positive technological “shock” raises real wages, people will work more, causing output to surge. 
In the face of a negative “shock,” workers will increase their leisure, causing output to fall. 
These are efficient responses to changes in real wages. 
No intervention by government is needed. 
Bailing out inefficient automobile companies like General Motors only slows down the rate of progress. 
In fact, whereas most schools of economic thought maintain that one of government’s key responsibilities is to smooth the cycle, “real” business-cycle theory argues that reducing volatility reduces welfare! 
First, in contrast to the dot-com boom, it is difficult to identify the technological “shock” that set off the boom. 
Of course, the upswing was marked by super-abundant credit. 
But this was not used to finance new inventions: it was the invention. 
It was called securitized mortgages. 
It left no monuments to human invention, only piles of financial ruin. 
Second, this type of model strongly implies that governments should do nothing in the face of such “shocks.” 
Indeed, “real” business-cycle economists typically argue that, but for Roosevelt’s misguided New Deal policies, recovery from the Great Depression of 1929-1933 would have been much faster than it was. 
But those sentiments are a world away from the pretty, polite techniques of his mathematical progeny. 
Pakistan’s Tipping Point 
LAHORE – Pakistan’s moment of political truth is fast approaching. 
On May 11, some 40-50 million voters will elect a new national assembly. 
The outcome, preceded by a spike in extremist violence, is likely to reverberate far and wide. 
The British colonial administration finally acquiesced, creating a country out of Muslim-majority areas. 
The population of what is now Pakistan was about two-thirds Muslim; the remainder were mostly Hindus and Sikhs. 
Eight million Muslim refugees fled India and entered Pakistan, and six million Hindus and Sikhs moved in the opposite direction. 
By the time this “ethnic cleansing” was over, Pakistan’s population was 95% Muslim. 
Over time, an increasing proportion of this population began to demand the creation of an Islamic state in the areas that were now Pakistan. 
The upcoming election will determine how far the country will go along this route. 
Pakistan is not the only Muslim country seeking to redefine its political and economic future. 
Similar processes are playing out in other large countries in the western part of the Islamic world. 
That may eventually happen in the western Islamic world as well, but only after a struggle of the type occurring now in Pakistan. 
Turkey seems to have found an answer, prodded in part by its wish to join the European Union. 
A conservative ruling party with deep religious roots is content to leave religion to private observance, with no direct influence on public policy. 
The role of the military in politics also needs to be resolved. 
Then there is sectarianism, particularly the growing strife between Sunni and Shia Muslims. 
This conflict may be exacerbated by the outcome in Syria. 
If Sunnis triumph there, they may become more assertive in countries that have large Shia populations. 
It is not often recognized that Pakistan has the world’s second-largest Shia population, after Iran, with roughly 50 million adherents. 
They have been mercilessly attacked in Karachi and Quetta in recent years, with more than 400 killed. 
Finally, there is the question of the Muslim world’s relations with the West, particular the United States. 
What replaces it will be determined by the shape of the new political order that finally emerges in the western Islamic world. 
In other words, more is at stake in Pakistan’s upcoming election than just the future of Pakistan. 
This is a real accomplishment in a country that was on a political roller-coaster for most of its history. 
But the coalition proved unable to translate political success into strong economic performance. 
The upcoming election has both nurtured hope and generated anxiety among Pakistanis. 
It could go either way. 
And, for good or bad, where Pakistan goes other Muslim countries could follow. 
The Uptick’s Downside 
Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have provided massive injections of liquidity. 
Volatility is down, confidence is up, and risk aversion is much lower – for now. 
To restore competitiveness and growth in these countries, the euro needs to fall towards parity with the US dollar. 
Second, there is now evidence of weakening performance in China and the rest of Asia. 
In China, the economic slowdown underway is unmistakable. 
Export growth is down sharply, turning negative vis-à-vis the eurozone’s periphery. 
Import growth, a sign of future exports, has also fallen. 
Similarly, Chinese residential investment and commercial real-estate activity are slowing sharply as home prices start to fall. 
Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore’s economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011. 
India’s government predicts 6.9% annual GDP growth in 2012, which would be the lowest rate since 2009. 
Taiwan’s economy fell into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Third, while US data have been surprisingly encouraging, America’s growth momentum appears to be peaking. 
Finally, geopolitical risks in the Middle East are rising, owing to the possibility of an Israeli military response to Iran’s nuclear ambitions. 
Moreover, there are broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that will not ease – and that might intensify. 
There is also the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, as well as strains between Israel and Turkey. 
Despite weak economic growth in advanced economies and a slowdown in many emerging markets, oil is already at around $100 per barrel. 
But the fear premium could push it significantly higher, with predictably negative effects on the global economy. 
That is yet another reason to believe that the global economy remains far from achieving a balanced and sustainable recovery. 
Civilizing the City 
BANGALORE – Half of humanity – 3.5 billion people – live in urban areas today. 
Our metropolises are the engines of growth for a global economy emerging from the shadow of financial crisis. 
But, as Bangalore’s citizens prepare to go to the polls in state elections, their concerns are not merely economic. 
The city’s financial success stories mask a darker reality – quality of life for many city-dwellers has deteriorated over recent years. 
The movement of the rural poor to large cities is one of the exemplary narratives of the modern era. 
And governments, which typically focus on crude measures of economic performance, encourage rapid urbanization. 
More than 50% of Chinese live in urban areas today, up from 25% in 1990, and the proportion is expected to reach 70% by 2035. 
While the majority of Indians still live in rural areas, this, too, is changing fast. 
From 1970 to 2010, India’s urban population grew by 250 million. 
The next quarter-billion will be added in half that time. 
By 2030, 70% of India’s GDP will come from its cities. 
But cities are simply unable to cope with the influx of migrants on the current scale. 
The problems are legion. 
Municipalities, often owing to corruption or poor management, are unable or unwilling to impose rigorous planning regulations. 
Infrastructure spending is either inadequate or poorly targeted. 
Workers come home from their jobs to homes that are dark, dank, and depressing. 
They feel unsafe on poorly-lit streets, and have little access to parks or recreational facilities. 
Mornings and evenings are lost to long commutes on polluted highways. 
As I take my morning strolls through Bangalore, though, I sense growing resentment of the inadequacies, and frustration at insufficient improvements in citizens’ quality of life. 
Democracy exists precisely to remedy the kinds of injustices I hear from the hardworking Bangaloreans I encounter on the street and online. 
Bangalore is a modern city, and its citizens are expressing their displeasure in modern ways – on Facebook, in chat rooms, and on Twitter. 
Already, there have been major strikes at factories across China – Motorola, Honda, and Foxconn, among others. 
Our cities risk becoming literally uninhabitable. 
Of the world’s ten most densely populated cities, seven are in India. 
The urban sprawl of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore has continued unchecked, unplanned, and with under-investment in infrastructure for far too long. 
Urban pollution contributed to 620,000 needless deaths in India last year, mainly among the very poor. 
The number of people living in our slums has doubled over the past decade, and is now greater than the population of the United Kingdom. 
It currently invests only $17 per capita, compared to $116 in China and $292 in the United States. 
India spends less on health care and education per capita than China, Brazil, South Africa, or Mexico. 
If India is to maintain its competitiveness, a focus on dramatically improving the nation’s urban areas is imperative. 
The task is daunting. 
This is why I have set up the Nammu Bengaluru (“Our Bangalore”) Awards. 
It is important to recognize those who are contributing to the vision of a city that is feted not just for its economic successes, but also for its quality of life. 
Their example is one that emerging-country urbanites everywhere should seek to emulate. 
Globalizing the Security Council 
BRASILIA – The 1945 United Nations Charter represented a historic breakthrough in the pursuit of peace on a multilateral basis. 
At the end of a global war that claimed more than 50 million lives, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the world’s two major powers. 
At its inception, the UN brought together 51 countries; it now has 193 member states. 
The world has gone through extraordinary transformations since then. 
Meanwhile, the global distribution of economic and political power has undergone a radical reconfiguration, setting the stage for the emergence of a multipolar international order. 
In this environment, the Security Council’s frozen composition is imposing significant limits on the international community’s capacity to address global challenges. 
Conflicts drag on without proper action from the body created to resolve them. 
Thousands of civilians die, are displaced, or are subjected to appalling human-rights abuses, while the Security Council proves unable or unwilling to act. 
Reform of the Council is thus urgent and indispensable. 
A majority of UN member states are in favor of creating a new Council with an expanded roster of both permanent and non-permanent members. 
This majority reflects a growing perception that the world would be more stable and more secure with a strengthened and updated multilateral system. 
That means adding new voices to reflect the world in which we now live. 
Only then will the Security Council have the legitimacy to act on today’s manifold conflicts. 
A reformed Security Council would reflect the emergence of new powers and their readiness to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. 
The contrast with matters of peace and security is stark. 
Entire regions of the world, such as Africa and Latin America, are excluded from the nucleus of decision-making. 
The greatest risk that we run is erosion of the Security Council’s credibility, and, with it, a diminishing capacity to confront grave threats to peace. 
We all stand to lose if new international crises end up being addressed by coalitions of countries at the margins of the Security Council and in a manner that flouts international law. 
The lessons of the recent past are clear. 
In any conflict, neighboring countries’ participation and commitment are indispensable to the achievement of peace. 
Only an expanded Security Council can enable effective conflict resolution worldwide. 
The international community cannot afford to postpone reform. 
The Sino-American Mirror 
The changes highlighted the sharp differences between the two countries’ political systems. 
And both countries’ leaders must deliver reforms within a limited tenure, with limited resources, and within a global context of trade rivalry and interdependence. 
Both countries face formidable resistance to reform from formidable vested interests and lobby groups. 
Both also face major price distortions, owing to quantitative easing by monetary policymakers, which has led to negative real interest rates. 
To some extent, the two countries’ problems are mirror images of each other. 
The US lacks investment in infrastructure and has excess investment in financial derivatives – the result of opaque leverage from over-consumption. 
China suffers from under-consumption and possible over-investment, and needs to strike a balance between the state-owned sector and private enterprise. 
China and the US can draw important lessons from the strengths and weaknesses inherent in both systems. 
First, in both countries, the challenge is not one of state versus market, but about finding complementarities between the two. 
Second, both countries must find the right metric to balance short-term and long-term interests. 
Yet the two leaders and their administrations must overcome monumental challenges as their countries strive to reach the next stage of their development. 
The Sino-American Test in North Korea 
MADRID – Repeated threats from North Korea have turned the Korean Peninsula into one of the world’s most dangerous hotspots. 
Ten years after opting out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, North Korea clearly possesses nuclear weapons. 
Nobody wants war on the Korean Peninsula. 
For the North, it would be suicide; for the South, with its vibrant economy and widening free-trade agreements, the opportunity cost would be particularly high. 
China is the key geostrategic player in resolving the conflict, because it provides North Korea with 90% of its energy, 80% of its consumer goods, and 40% of its food. 
But it is unclear how much influence China’s government holds over Kim Jong-un’s regime. 
The North Koreans believe that China sacrificed them for commercial interests, and bilateral relations have yet to recover. 
Either of these traumatic outcomes would spell disaster, for both the region and the world. 
First, the regime’s implosion would unleash a massive refugee flow, implying enormous social and economic costs. 
Given these conditions, even a small spark could ignite a wildfire. 
Only through such efforts will China be able to increase its international legitimacy, thereby minimizing the risk of future conflict. 
It is essential that China and the US work together to resolve the current crisis. 
This cooperation is the only way to force the North’s hand and put an end to the incessant cycle of crisis and mounting risk. 
This is a good starting point. 
Sino-US cooperation on this flashpoint could be a huge step forward in building much-needed bilateral strategic trust. 
But the two countries’ markedly different foreign-policy approaches will not facilitate matters. 
To make the most of it requires a significant boost in mutual strategic trust. 
The US-China Dialogue of the Deaf 
The two sides are talking past each other, though both are making valid points. 
The global imbalances that were at the root at the Crash of 2008 have not been corrected – indeed, some have grown larger. 
The US still consumes more than it produces, running a chronic trade deficit. 
Households are over-indebted and must save more. 
The US economy needs higher productivity, but US corporations, which are operating very profitably, are accumulating cash instead of investing it – with quantitative easing aimed at heading off deflation. 
In China, by contrast, bank lending needs to be reigned in, but regulatory efforts have been hindered by off-balance-sheet financing and the development of an informal quasi-banking sector. The economy is showing signs of over-heating. 
But domestic politics in both countries stand in the way. 
That is why the Fed had to resort to quantitative easing, even though it tends to stimulate asset bubbles rather than productive investments. 
China interprets quantitative easing as a plot to devalue the dollar and force a revaluation of the renminbi. 
Maintaining a two-tier currency system and an undervalued currency has been the key to China’s success. 
As things stand now, each country is pursuing policies that do not help the other and are suboptimal for their own economies. 
The conflict in economic policy is spreading to the geopolitical sphere. First, China asserted a “core interest” in the South China Sea, effectively claiming its 200-mile “special economic zone” throughout the region as territorial waters. 
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton countered that America also has “interests” in this area, bringing the two countries to loggerheads over a vast and critically important maritime region in Asia. 
Then China became embroiled with Japan in a dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku Islands. 
Few Westerners appreciate how seriously China takes this issue. Geologically, the islands are connected to Taiwan, and Japan gained control over them by taking possession of Taiwan in 1895. 
This elevates these uninhabited rocks to the same level of importance as Taiwan or Tibet for the official “one China doctrine.” 
China greatly resented it when the US endorsed the Japanese position. 
China’s rapid rise, and America’s equally rapid loss of power and influence, has created a dangerous situation. 
With the exception of the peaceful transition of world leadership from Britain to the US after World War I, such global power shifts have always involved armed conflict. 
Consider Afghanistan. The country is rich in mineral resources that China needs, but it is the US that spends $10 billion a month occupying a country whose annual GDP is only $15 billion. 
As things stand, the US is likely to reduce its presence before Afghanistan is pacified and the mineral resources developed. Since China is the obvious market for these minerals, it would make sense for China to encourage continued American engagement by making a significant contribution to the cost of training the Afghan army. 
China was farsighted when it adopted the doctrine of harmonious development, but recently it has veered from it. 
Apparently, the rate of change has been too rapid for Chinese leaders to adjust to it. 
The leadership is preoccupied with taking care of the needs of its own people, many of whom still live in poverty. 
Only if China pays closer attention to how it is perceived and accepted by the rest of the world can it continue to rise in a peaceful manner. 
China’s leadership knows that it must fulfill its own people’s minimum expectations in order to maintain internal peace and stability; now it must learn to make itself acceptable to the rest of the world in order to preserve external peace and stability. That means becoming a more open society and playing a more active role in maintaining a peaceful and stable world order. 
By contrast, when it comes to military might, China will not be a match for the US for some time to come. 
In that case, today’s prosperity is likely to prove transient. 
Worried neighbors are likely to seek protection under the wings of the American eagle, reinforcing the US military budget, which is already oversized. 
Unless a deliberate effort is made by both sides to reach a better understanding, the world faces a turbulent time in 2011 and beyond. 
China and the American Dream 
But America still makes people dream, and its emotional hold on the world remains unique. 
Of course, America is no longer what it used to be. 
It is far too indebted to be the ultimate strategic and economic insurance policy for its allies, as it was in the past. 
But, if America’s protective power has receded, its power to inspire remains unique and can still redound to its benefit in the most spectacular way. 
Obama’s victory was not only that of democracy, but also of a certain vision and message of America. 
Romney’s mistake was to align himself for too long with ideas that were too radical for him – and for America. 
In fact, one runs the risk of losing not only one’s soul, but also elections. 
That was Nicolas Sarkozy’s fate in France: he was defeated after losing the support of the center of the electorate. 
Obama was reelected because the Republican Party lost sight of the center in America. 
Of course, the greatness of America’s democracy should not hide its deep flaws and current dysfunction. 
“Vetocracy” – reflected in the Republicans’ routine Congressional obstructionism in Obama’s first term – is a threat to democracy. 
Will the party, chastened by its electoral defeat, recognize that its responsibility is to the American people, and not only to its members and followers? 
America cannot continue to live with the injustices of its health-care system or with crumbling and obsolete infrastructure. 
Nor can it remain indifferent to the increasingly unacceptable indebtedness of its university students. 
America’s main challenge globally is to accept that it will no longer be alone at the top. 
It has never had to deal with others as equals, unlike traditional European powers, which have done so for centuries. 
China’s challenge, however, may be more difficult. 
It not only has to live with the reality of US power; it must also take into account the American ideal. 
Today, too, it is not America’s military strength that threatens or challenges China, but rather the enduring attraction of “the American dream.” 
America’s Third-World Politics 
CAMBRIDGE – With its presidential election over, the United States can finally take a breather from campaign politics, at least for a while. 
Maybe that is too harsh an assessment of Africa’s nascent democracies. 
If you think I exaggerate, you have not been paying close attention. 
Without question, the worst offenders are America’s Republicans, whose leaders have somehow become enraptured by ideas that are beyond the pale in other advanced countries. 
But, when pressed on it, Romney was sufficiently uncomfortable about his position that he wobbled on the issue. 
The Darwinian theory of evolution has long been a dirty word among Republicans as well. 
Likewise, if there is an archaic idea in economics, it is that the US should return to the Gold Standard. 
No one was surprised when the party’s platform gave a nod to the Gold Standard in its convention in August. 
Most Europeans cannot understand how, in a civilized country, both candidates can favor the death penalty. 
And I won’t even get into the abortion debate. 
Candidate Romney was so cowed by his party’s obsession with low taxes that he never put forth a budget that added up. 
So rampant were the equivocations, untruths, and outright lies from both camps that many media outlets and non-partisan groups maintained running lists of factual distortions. 
None of these claims was true. 
“It’s been that sort of campaign,” FactCheck.org’s analysts wrote, “filled from beginning to end with deceptive attacks and counterattacks, and dubious claims.” 
One can draw two possible conclusions from America’s election. 
The other possibility is that what is said and done during an election makes little difference to a polity’s health. 
Campaigns are always a time for cheap populism and kowtowing to single-issue fundamentalists. 
Perhaps what really matters is what happens after a candidate takes office: the quality of the checks and balances within which he or she operates, the advice offered, the decisions taken, and, ultimately, the policies pursued. 
The Use and Abuse of Religious Freedom 
MELBOURNE – What are the proper limits of religious freedom? 
Marianne Thieme, leader of the Party for the Animals in the Netherlands, offers this answer: “Religious freedom stops where human or animal suffering begins.” 
If they cannot do so, the requirement to stun before slaughtering will be implemented. 
Religious persecution was common in previous centuries, and still occurs in some countries today. 
But prohibiting the ritual slaughter of animals does not stop Jews or Muslims from practicing their religion. 
Neither Islam nor Judaism upholds a requirement to eat meat. 
Catholicism does not oblige its adherents to run hospitals and universities. 
Of course, the Catholic Church would be understandably reluctant to give up its extensive networks of hospitals and universities. 
Religious exemption from military service can be more difficult to resolve, because some religions teach pacifism. 
Judaism, however, is not pacifist, so, once again, there is no real issue of religious freedom at stake. 
Providing the option of non-combatant national service thus will not resolve this dispute, unless it consists of Torah study. 
Not all conflicts between religion and the state are easy to resolve. 
The Uses and Abuses of Economic Ideology 
Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” 
This belief system did not, of course, exclude the possibility of market intervention. 
But it did determine assumptions about the appropriate nature and limits of intervention. 
Similarly, regulation and enforcement to prevent market abuse was justifiable, because rational agents can also be greedy, corrupt, or even criminal. 
And, in the wider triumph of the precepts of financial deregulation and market completion, both interests and ideology have clearly played a role. 
The financial sector dominates non-academic employment of professional economists. 
Regulators need to hire industry experts to regulate effectively; but industry experts are almost bound to share the industry’s implicit assumptions. 
Understanding these social and cultural processes could itself be an important focus of new research. 
But we should not underplay the importance of ideology. 
Such guiding philosophies are most compelling when they provide clear answers. 
And a philosophy that asserts that financial innovation, market completion, and increased market liquidity are always and axiomatically beneficial provides a clear basis for regulatory decentralization. 
Here, I suspect, is where the greatest challenge for the future lies. 
Let us hope that practical men and women will learn that lesson. 
The Usual Suspect 
The fiscal implications of this are striking. 
Suppose that the United States or the Western European core economies boost their government purchases for next year by $100 billion. 
In that case, a simple constant-monetary-conditions multiplier indicates that we can expect roughly $150 billion of extra GDP. 
That boost, in turn, generates $50 billion of extra tax revenue, implying a net addition to the national debt of only $50 billion. 
What is the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate that the US or Western European core economies will have to pay on that extra $50 billion of debt? 
If it is 3%, the required increase in annual tax revenues rises to $1.5 billion a year. 
If it is 5%, the government will need an additional $2.5 billion per year. 
Governments will not have to raise taxes to finance extra debt taken on to fund fiscal boosts. 
Now this is, to say the least, a highly unusual situation. 
A more usual multiplier is the monetary-policy offset multiplier of 0.5 or zero. 
But the situation today is not usual at all. 
Today the global economy is, as Ricardo Cabellero of MIT stresses, still desperately short of safe assets. 
The Vagina Chronicles 
NEW YORK – Has there really been a sexual revolution? 
Many of the reactions to my book tend to confirm that belief. 
Many responses were positive: the book is Publishers Weekly’s top science book of the fall. 
We need to have that conversation. 
Our societies do not take seriously women’s sexual integrity or crimes against it. 
The modern history of female sexuality has been plagued with misinformation, embarrassment, and sexual frustration. 
Hite’s important assertion that there is more to female sexual response than penetration triggered a wave of information about female sexuality. 
This argument is based on the latest science about dopamine’s role in arousal (as James Pfaus and his team at Concordia University in Montreal have documented), as well as on well-established summaries of the literature, such as David Linden’s The Compass of Pleasure. 
Similarly, a rich body of data, including many important studies by Alessandra Rellini and Cindy Meston, now links women’s arousal to their autonomic nervous systems (Rellini and Meston have even found that rape can affect women’s baseline ANS years after the assault). 
That is nothing if not a “feminist” validation of many women’s intuitive experiences and needs. 
This finding should help women be less judgmental about the unique nature of their sexual responses. 
It seems odd to me that one would have to make a case for this in 2012. 
The Value of a Pale Blue Dot 
What does astronomy tell us about “the starry firmament above”? 
But, at the same time, our greater knowledge surely forces us to acknowledge that our place in the universe is not particularly significant. 
Today, we don’t need to rely on such verbal descriptions of our planet’s insignificance against the background of our galaxy. 
The astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that the Voyager space probe capture an image of earth as it reached the outer reaches of our solar system. 
It did so, in 1990, and Earth shows up in a grainy image as a pale blue dot. 
That is a moving experience, but what should we learn from it? 
But no such nihilistic view of our existence follows from the size of our planetary home, and Russell himself was no nihilist. 
On the contrary, he made nuclear disarmament the chief focus of his political activity for the remainder of his life. 
Al Gore used the “pale blue dot” image at the end of his film, An Inconvenient Truth, suggesting that if we wreck this planet, we have nowhere else to go. 
The Value of Being Undervalued 
The paramount policy dilemma that emerging markets face nowadays is this: on the one hand, sustained economic growth requires a competitive (read “undervalued”) currency. 
On the other hand, any good news is immediately followed by currency appreciation, making the task of remaining competitive that much harder. 
So, you finally passed that crucial piece of legislation? 
Your fiscally responsible political party just won the election? 
Or your commodity exports hit the jackpot? 
Good for you! 
Success brings its reward in the form of immediate punishment! 
This is the strategy followed by countries such as China and Argentina. 
This is the strategy pursued by countries such as Turkey and South Africa, which have adopted more conventional “inflation targeting” regimes. 
The first strategy is problematic because it is unsustainable. 
The second is undesirable because it buys stability at the cost of growth. 
The importance of a competitive currency for economic growth is undeniable. 
Virtually every instance of sustained high growth has been accompanied by a significantly depreciated real exchange rate. 
This is as true of South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960’s and 1970’s, as it is of Argentina today. 
Chile made its transition to high growth in the 1980’s on the back of a large depreciation. 
Since the 1990’s, both China and India have received a huge boost from their undervalued currencies. 
These are just some of the better-known examples. 
Looking at the experience of more than 100 countries, I have found in my research that each 10% undervaluation adds 0.3 percentage points to growth. 
Currency undervaluation is such a potent instrument for growth for the simple reason that it creates incentives for the economy’s growth-promoting sectors. 
An undervalued currency enables an economy to integrate into the world economy on the basis of strong export performance. 
It stimulates production (and hence employment), unlike overvaluation, which stimulates consumption. 
So what should policymakers do? 
While the central bank bears a good part of the responsibility, it needs support from other parts of the government, most notably from the finance ministry. 
Otherwise, the competitiveness gains would be offset by rising inflation. 
This may not be popular, especially in an economic downturn. 
There are other instruments available for increasing domestic saving and reducing consumption besides the fiscal balance. 
Government policies can target private saving directly, by creating incentives for saving through appropriate tax and pension policies. 
There is little to be gained from letting hot money flow into an economy freely. 
With such policies in place, the comfort zone for central banks is enlarged sufficiently to loosen monetary policy. 
This can be done without announcing a specific target level for the exchange rate. 
This will mean more investment in tradable industries, more employment overall, and faster growth. 
You will know you have succeeded when the United States’ Treasury Secretary comes knocking on your door saying that you are guilty of manipulating your currency. 
The Value of European Values 
Europe's leaders have revived the constitutional talks that broke down last December in a dispute about voting rights. 
Such disputes are, of course, subject to compromises, which are likely to be found. 
What still needs to be settled is a clear understanding of what the constitution is meant to achieve. 
Two fundamental principles have underpinned European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity. 
Both principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and law. 
They are, in short, inscribed in the EU's history and ideals. 
But what do solidarity and subsidiarity really mean? 
This does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed: European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of it. 
Dynamic solidarity, in other words, means favoring policies that foster investment, innovation, economic growth, and employment. 
However, as GDP growth in the EU indicates, dynamic solidarity has been undermined over the last decade. 
What is particularly worrying is the research and development lag. 
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population, which, along with slower growth, has led to structural fiscal imbalances. 
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that it, too, has two interpretations: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity. 
Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers among different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions, and municipalities. 
The best-known application of this principle is federalism. 
In the European Treaties, we find a clear expression of vertical subsidiarity. 
But is this enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional settings of the Union? 
Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings, as well as social and economic powers. 
It encompasses the relations between state, society, and market. 
But society and the market have their own rights and sovereignties that are not granted by the state. 
So the problem comes in assuring the autonomy of each realm. 
This support, however, should be implemented in ways that the natural potential of individuals, society, and the market is promoted. 
Today, both values are defined in ways that favor the state. 
Indeed, focusing on market-based growth has often been identified with the semi-alien values of America. 
But these values are deeply ingrained in Europe, and should be brought out again. 
That is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written. 
Race-Based Medicine? 
Much of the current debate centers on whether race should be a criterion for inclusion in clinical trials – and, by extension, whether drug labeling should mention race specifically. 
In fact, clinical trials are not intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of a treatment (drug, medical device, or other intervention) in a completely random sample from the general population. 
For example, scientists have known for decades that certain drugs can cause severe and precipitous anemia in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme G6PD. 
Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit. 
Enrichment allows researchers to perform smaller, more informative trials by helping them to design studies that will show a high “relative treatment difference” between the drug and whatever it is being compared to (often a placebo, but sometimes another treatment). 
Giving the latter group exogenous growth hormone is futile, because their immune systems react to the “foreign” protein by producing antibodies. Although the hormone may stimulate growth for a short period, the antibodies soon bind and neutralize it. 
By limiting the study population to children in the other two groups, for whom exogenous growth hormone stimulates normal growth, researchers achieved a 100% relative treatment difference. In other words, every subject who received the active drug responded, and none of those who received the placebo did. 
Clearly, genetic markers are useful in designing clinical trials. 
For the cardiac drug BiDil (a combination of the vasodilators hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate), the answer is yes. 
In 1996, inconclusive clinical trials led US regulators to reject the drug. 
But when more detailed analysis of the data revealed potentially elevated benefits for black patients, a new trial was performed on 1,050 self-identified “black” patients with severe heart failure for whom available treatments had proved ineffective. 
The results – a 43% reduction in mortality and a 39% decrease in hospital visits among patients who received BiDil – were so striking that the study was concluded early. 
Although BiDil has not been a great commercial success since its approval in 2009, it remains on the market. 
Some regard race-based medical treatment as necessary to reduce health disparities, while others view it as downright discriminatory. 
But we must fight illness with the data we have, not the data we wish we had. Political and ethical sensitivities notwithstanding, drug testing, approval, and labeling must go wherever the evidence leads. 
The Vanished Intellectual 
This spring marks the centenary of the birth of two all-round intellectuals, those ideological avatars of the Cold War era, Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre. 
Aron was born on March 14, 1905, Sartre on June 21. 
Sartre and Aron began their 50-year acquaintance with a shared elite French education that included a formative period in Germany just before the rise of Nazism. 
Aron wrote cool, sleek prose about the most heated geopolitical conflicts, while Sartre could turn any triviality into an existential crisis. 
Yet they often stood together against the French political establishment. 
Both joined the Resistance when France was a Nazi puppet state, and both called for Algerian independence after France regained its sovereignty. 
Theirs is a fate perennially suffered by intellectuals. 
But most of us are likely to recoil at the methods they used in their work as intellectuals: caricature, deception, and even fabrication. 
Consider three examples. 
Abelard is credited with the introduction of theology as a critical discipline in Christianity. 
Similarly, Galileo is now known to have committed what we now call “research fraud” in his famed physical experiments. 
Assuming he conducted them at all, they very probably did not produce the neat results that he used to assail his opponents. 
All three were subsequently vindicated – sometimes in their lifetimes, sometimes not. 
What they shared is a paradoxical ethic common to all intellectuals: the end cause of truth justifies whatever means happens to be at your disposal. 
This is because the whole truth is rarely what passes for the truth at any moment. 
Such an ethic is abhorrent in today’s world, where knowledge is parceled out to academic disciplines like bits of real estate. 
To an intellectual, an academic may look like someone who mistakes the means of inquiry for its end. 
But to academics, intellectuals look like ramblers freely trespassing on other people’s property, picking the fruits and despoiling the soil. 
When the Enlightenment philosophers renovated the old Christian slogan, “The truth shall set you free,” they imagined a process of opening doors, not building barricades. 
In short, intellectuals want their audiences to think for themselves, not simply shift allegiances from one expert to another. 
The intellectual’s ethic is both exhilarating and harsh, for it places responsibility for thinking squarely on the thinker’s shoulders. 
Every act of deference thus becomes an abdication of one’s own intellectual authority. 
The slogan “Knowledge is power” may be familiar, but only intellectuals see its full implications. 
Obviously, greater knowledge enhances our capacity to act. 
What is much less obvious is that such empowerment requires the destruction of socially sanctioned knowledge. 
Aron and Sartre developed contrasting, but equally controversial, styles of destroying received belief. 
Aron preferred demonizing fellow intellectuals as alarmists than conceding that the Cold War might eventuate in a nuclear holocaust. 
Aron exaggerated the power of reason, while Sartre inflated the power of action. 
Each wanted to take French society in radically different directions, but both never ceased being critical of the status quo. 
In the end, the two appear to have thought both in and out of their time. 
While this makes them awkward candidates for any academic discipline, such is the ambivalence of any intellectual’s legacy. 
The Vanishing Bomb 
Security rested on a balance of fear, as reflected in the concept of mutually assured destruction. 
In that bipolar world, nuclear weapons were held by only five global powers, all permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
Today, the global picture is different. 
Sparked by Poland’s Solidarity movement, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and the bipolar world and its East-West divide vanished. 
An order based on the dangerous doctrine of mutual deterrence, was not, however, replaced with a system founded on cooperation and interdependence. 
Destabilization and chaos followed, accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability. 
Nuclear weapons are now also held by three states engaged in conflicts: India, Pakistan, and Israel. 
Given the development of the nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, they, too, may become nuclear-weapon states. 
There is also a real danger that this group may expand further to include states where governments will not always be guided by rational considerations. 
There is also the risk that nuclear weapons may fall into the hands of non-state actors, such as terrorist groups. 
An effective non-proliferation regime will not be possible unless the major nuclear powers, especially the United States and Russia, take urgent steps toward nuclear disarmament. 
Together, they hold nearly 25,000 nuclear warheads – 96% of the global nuclear arsenal. 
It gives us hope that US President Barack Obama recognizes these dangers. 
Indeed, the goal of a nuclear-free world was incorporated in the US administration’s arms control and disarmament agenda. 
Opponents of nuclear disarmament used to argue that this goal was unattainable in the absence of an effective system of control and verification. 
But, today, appropriate means of control are available to the international community. 
Of key importance are the nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
This is especially urgent now, with the search for new energy sources and a “renaissance” of nuclear power. 
The 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference calls for an urgent formulation of priorities. 
The Preparatory Committee will meet in New York this May, and this is where the necessary decisions should be made. 
The fact that these states were denuclearized as part of the Safe and Secure Disarmament program provides a valuable lesson. 
The process of gradual nuclear disarmament must be set in motion. 
The deadliest threat to global security comes from a qualitatively new wave of nuclear proliferation. 
The heaviest responsibility is shouldered by the powers that hold the largest arsenals. 
The Vanishing Swedish Exception? 
For the past two years, Western Europe's voters have been turning rightward. 
Opinion polls just a few months ago gave the Social Democrats 44% popular support. 
Together with the former Communists and the Greens, the left held a comfortable 12-15% lead over the four non-socialist parties. 
Why has Sweden held out against the right-wing tide sweeping so much of Western Europe? 
The immediate reason for Social Democracy's enduring appeal is foreign policy. 
In early 2001, Sweden held the EU presidency, giving Prime Minister Göran Persson, the country's dominant politician, a bright spotlight in which to shine. 
Persson exudes competence and authority. 
But he has done nothing remarkable since winning again in 1998. 
Sweden's economy rose and fell with the IT bubble, reflected in telecoms giant Ericsson's troubles today. 
But force of character cannot mask real problems and a changing political agenda. 
Although foreigners often idealize Sweden's welfare state, its economy has been losing ground steadily for 30 years. 
In 1970, GDP per head was the fourth highest in the world; now it is 17 th place in the OECD. 
Every year Sweden attains 1% less growth on average than the rest of the West. 
The decline has been gradual, so it fails to alarm voters, but Swedes certainly notice it when they go abroad. 
Conservatives demand lower taxes, but this is unpopular: almost 65% of Swedes live on public salaries or social transfers. 
Unlike other Europeans, Swedes are thus much keener to keep taxes high, which guarantees a large left-wing vote. 
Even so, Swedes fret about the deteriorating quality of services provided by the social welfare system. 
The Social Democrats shrewdly reversed themselves on this point during this year's campaign, but health care entitlements have clearly gone too far. 
No less than 14% of Swedish employees are currently registered as sick, double the number five years ago. 
The Social Democrats argue that this reflects a serious health problem, while non-socialists suggest that the system is defective. 
Many Swedes have come to believe that it is their right to register as sick regardless of their health . 
No other evidence suggests that public health is actually declining. 
Deteriorating public education poses another worry. 
The Social Democrats lost miserably in the capital. 
As in most recent European elections, immigration loomed large, but as usual, Sweden was out of step with other countries. 
The small Liberal party, which campaigned in favor of free labor immigration, tripled its support. 
Roughly 70% of Swedes support free immigration of laborers--far higher than elsewhere in Europe. 
But Prime Minister Persson, kowtowing to the trade unions, insists on blocking labor immigration altogether for the next decade. 
After so many years of Social Democratic rule, a large political caste has also developed. 
The main qualification of two current ministers is that their parents were ministers. 
The party itself is awash in trade union money, which is exempt from taxation as a result of sheer cronyism. 
But Swedes have shown that still like the welfare state. 
While they worry about the quality of public services, they are not prepared to join Europe's rightist revival. 
So Sweden's Social Democrats don't have to concede much to remain remarkably strong--even if this weakens the integrity of Swedish democracy. 
The Varieties of Unemployment 
Let me be the first to say that structural unemployment is a true and severe danger. 
And if unemployment in Europe and North America stays elevated for two or three more years, it is highly likely that we will have to face it. 
For nothing converts cyclical unemployment into structural unemployment more certainly than prolonged unemployment. 
But is that true today? 
Does it look right now as if the biggest problem facing the economies of Europe and North America is structural unemployment? 
It does not. 
Let us remember what structural unemployment looks like. 
The structure of demand by consumers is different from the jobs that workers are capable of filling. 
In that case, we would expect to see construction depressed: firms closed, capital goods idle, and workers unemployed. 
The size and duration of the excess unemployment of ex-construction workers might be substantial and long lasting. 
It might require significant time to retrain construction workers and plug them into social networks in which they become good manufacturing workers. 
We might see prolonged and high unemployment in the construction sector, and in regions that had seen the biggest previous construction booms. 
That is what “mismatch” structural unemployment looks like – and it is not what we have today, at least not in Europe and North America. 
Employment is up in health care, Internet-related businesses, and perhaps in logging and mining. 
This may well look like structural unemployment in three years. 
But that is not our problem now. 
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. 
The Veil Wars 
Across the world veiling has been making a comeback. 
Why is this resurgence happening? 
Although the veil is supposedly grounded in tradition, its reappearance appears to be a response to today’s social and political instability. 
In Afghanistan and other parts of Asia the collapse of Communist regimes incited a rise in religious orthodoxy, as did the overthrow of the Shah in Iran. 
In Turkey, the government banned headscarves in public schools and universities. 
The headscarf has also been forbidden in Turkey’s parliament. 
In Egypt, for example, as in Tunisia and Uzbekistan, there are laws in place banning the full veil. 
Headscarves were first banned in France by administrative decree. 
It also seems to contain within it fears about the potential erosion of French national identity. 
Given such pressures, the veil is a charged symbol across France. 
But what can be done about it? 
Moreover, veils allow women greater access to secular institutions from which they would be precluded otherwise. 
In general, wearing a veil affords greater freedom to women in male dominated societies. 
Whether the veil is embraced or loathed, these veiling wars mark a vast, almost global battle about cultural and political identity. 
The veil, and the battles over it, also represents a culture war that is disproportionately played out on women’s bodies. 
After all, naked power usually seeks to hide behind a veil. 
The Velvet Delusion 
History, for some, seemed to have come to an end. 
For Americans, 1989 validated everything they already believed. 
They had won the Cold War, or so they perceived, through hard force and conviction. 
Subsequent events seemed to validate this American recipe. 
The Gulf War confirmed American military might and the age-old perils of appeasement. 
The lesson was clear: “we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom.” 
This is why Obama’s America spends more on weaponry than the rest of the world combined, and why democracy-promotion remains the unquestioned foundation of American foreign policy, with debate possible only about its application. 
History offers a recipe for success, so long as Americans adhere to the lesson of 1989. 
They heard in pleas for freedom from behind the Iron Curtain not a desire to become American, but to join the remarkably successful European experiment in collective security and prosperity that emerged after World War II. 
For today’s European leaders, the central lesson of 1989 is that force is counterproductive; what matters is consensus. 
When Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of a “Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals,” his conception was not of a continent under Soviet domination, as Josef Stalin once threatened. 
Having demonstrated remarkable restraint in 1989, Russian leaders expected to be embraced by the West. 
Instead, NATO expanded to Russia’s doorstep, the European Union barred its doors, and membership in the World Trade Organization seemed out of reach. 
The post-Soviet economy crumbled, crime skyrocketed, and life expectancy declined. 
Russia’s voice in global affairs lost authority. 
For Russian leaders, 1989’s lesson was clear: trusting the West was foolish at best, dangerous at worst. 
Gorbachev’s vision of European inclusion neglected centuries of Russian history; the West did not want Russian participation. 
Better that Russians rely on their own power, develop their own resources, and police their own borders. 
The Kremlin trusted the West in 1989. 
They recoiled at the Soviet bloc’s disintegration. 
“Every effort should be made to prevent changes in Eastern Europe from influencing China’s internal development,” party officials concluded in March 1989, and within months they violently crushed democratic protesters. 
China took from 1989 the lesson that state stability was paramount. 
Yet China’s leaders also recognized that they ignored popular demands at great peril. 
Chinese foreign policy also prioritized legitimacy after 1989, with the regime hoping to reassert its authority globally by expanding China’s participation in international organizations. 
Chinese leaders embraced the cooperative nature of the post-1945 European process, but simultaneously took the Russian lesson to heart: the West would not yield merely to good intentions. 
But, unlike Russia, China de-emphasized the relevance of traditional hard power to achieve its goals. 
Chinese power today comes not from its ability to match America’s blue-water navy, but from its holdings in US Treasury bonds. 
The legacy of 1989 echoes even in Iran, whose leaders seem clearly to have learned from Tiananmen Square and the collapse of the Iron Curtain that a committed government can, indeed, demobilize a public demanding reform. 
The Virtual Enemy 
Yet after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse. 
It is time to understand the new, emerging model of conflict. 
In order to make the “war” paradigm fit, the Bush administration alludes to al-Qaeda as a centrally directed enemy. 
In fact, there is now no master planner or funder of terrorist activities. 
Independently generated plots emerged and used ad hoc resources, often within the target country. 
Those small operations also lacked a common internal design. 
Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person. 
Individuals can be involved for profit and power, or for political and religious reasons, while others participate for hate or thrills. 
Moreover, there are vast differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain, or jumps from cell to cell. 
Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head. 
The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context. 
Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative, and, in the business sector, they are possibly the only system that can build a one-off product well. 
A conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry. 
In fact, they are probably the commercial model of the future. 
The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability. 
At present, most of the price of any product supports the huge, inefficient organization that assembled it. 
This model is the current basis of the business world, just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy. 
The small suppliers actually provide you with 80% of the value and innovation but only receive 20% of the reward. 
While the forces were deployed for a flexible entry and withdrawal, the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-fashioned occupation. 
Terrorists have been better at capitalizing on models of distributed operation. 
Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies. 
The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public. 
These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques. 
Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management: how to nurture and support self-organizing cells. 
Perhaps the first lesson for Western policymakers is that virtual enterprises run on a culture of trust. 
Some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of “not us” rather than on real values and direct experience. 
That is why the Bush administration’s actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic. 
Bush’s “us and them” rhetoric clearly defines an “other” and positions it as a cohesive enemy. 
His “war” approach is making it easier for Islamist terrorists to view the West as an equally united and malevolent force. 
In the future, the virtual enterprise model will shape how business is conducted, wars will be fought and probably how government services will be administered. 
It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, implying faster innovation and economic growth. 
However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate, they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise. 
The Virtual Imagination 
Today, two sorts of books exist: those to be read and those to be consulted. 
With books-to-be-read, you start at page 1, say, where the author tells you a crime has been committed. 
You follow until the end, when you discover who is guilty. 
End of book; end of reading experience. 
The same happens even if you read philosophy, say, Husserl. 
The author opens at the fist page, and follows a series of questions in order for you to see how he reaches his conclusions. 
Encyclopedias, of course, are never meant to be read cover to cover. 
It is possible that the two met. 
To know precisely, I consult a biography of Kant. 
A biography of Napoleon, who met many people, might disregard a meeting with Kant; a biography of Kant would not. 
Computers are beginning to change the reading process. 
With a hypertext, for example, I can ask for all the cases in which the name of Napoleon is linked with Kant. 
I can do my job in a few seconds. 
Hypertexts will render obsolete printed encyclopedia. 
Two inventions on the verge of being exploited may help computers begin to satisfy these needs. 
The first is a copying machine through which you scan library catalogues and the books of publishing houses. 
You select the book you need, push a button, and the machine will print and bind your copy. 
This will change all publishing; it will probably eliminate bookstores but not books. 
Books will be tailored to the desires of the buyer, as happened with old manuscripts. 
But this book is as different as the first Shakespeare folio of 1623 is from the latest Penguin edition. 
Some people who say that they never read printed books are now reading, say, Kafka, in an e-book. 
On paper or on the electronic page, Kafka is the same for readers, if not from the point of view of eye doctors. 
Books will survive because of their utilitarian value, but the creative process in which they arise may not. 
To understand why, we must draw a distinction between systems and text. 
A system is all the possibilities displayed by a given natural language. 
A text, however, reduces the infinite possibilities of a system to form a closed universe. 
Take the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. 
You can read the fairy tale as an allegory and attribute different morals to the events and characters, but you cannot transform Little Red Riding Hood into Cinderella. 
But many internet programs suggest that a story is enriched by successive contributions. 
Take Little Red Riding Hood again. 
Both enter an enchanted castle. They may confront a magic crocodile. 
And so on. The notion of authorship is thrown in doubt. 
This has sometimes happened in the past without disturbing authorship. 
With the Commedia dell’arte, every performance was different. We cannot identify a single work due to a single author. 
Another example is a jazz jam session. 
We may believe there is a privileged performance of “Basin Street Blues” because a recording survives. 
But there were as many Basin Street Blues as there were performances. 
But there is a difference between infinite, unlimited texts and texts which can be interpreted in infinite ways but are physically limited. 
Make “War and Peace” into a hypertext and you can rewrite the story: Pierre kills Napoleon or Napoleon defeats General Kutusov. 
What freedom! 
Everyone is Tolstoy! 
In Les Miserables Victor Hugo provides us with a beautiful description of Waterloo. 
Hugo not only knows what happened but also what could have happened and didn’t. 
Besides, Hugo tells us “Such a fall which astonished the whole of History, is it something without a cause? 
Their repressive lesson is indispensable to reach a higher state of intellectual and moral freedom. 
The Wages of Economic Ignorance 
LONDON – Politicians are masters at “passing the buck.” 
Everything good that happens reflects their exceptional talents and efforts; everything bad is caused by someone or something else. 
The economy is a classic field for this strategy. 
But this is to turn the matter on its head. 
The eurozone crisis did not derail recovery; it is the result of a lack of recovery. 
It is the natural, predictable, and (by many) predicted result of the main European countries’ deliberate policy of repressing aggregate demand. 
That policy was destined to produce a financial crisis, because it was bound to leave governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts. 
Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne blame the eurozone crisis; in fact, their own economic illiteracy is to blame. 
This means that its income falls, because spending by one firm or household is income for another. 
In this situation, government deficits rise naturally, as tax revenues decline and spending on unemployment insurance and other benefits rises. 
These “automatic stabilizers” plug part of the private-sector spending gap. 
True, if governments stop spending altogether, deficits will eventually fall to zero. 
People will starve to death in the interim, but the budget will be balanced. 
That is the crazy logic of current economic policy in much of Europe (and elsewhere). 
Of course, it will not be carried through to the bitter end. 
Too much will crack along the way – the banks, the monetary system, social cohesion, the legitimacy of the political regime. 
Our leaders may be intellectually challenged, but they are not suicidal. 
In the United Kingdom, there is already talk of Plan A +. 
Apart from questions of fairness, cutting top tax rates is an inferior way to increase spending, because the rich have a higher propensity to save. 
Tax reductions should be targeted specifically at the poor if one wants the money to be spent to stimulate the economy. 
In fact, the best option of all is for the government to spend the money itself. 
Governments can do this consistently with a medium-term deficit-reduction plan by making a crucial distinction between their budgets’ current and capital accounts. 
The current account covers spending on services and perishable goods that produce no assets. 
The capital account is for buying or building durable assets that give a prospective future return. 
The first is a charge on taxation; the second is not. 
If today’s accounting rules are too insensitive to make this distinction, a separate entity could do the investing. 
A national investment bank would be capitalized by the government, borrow from the private sector, and invest in infrastructure, housing, and “greening” the economy. 
This would simultaneously plug a hole in demand and improve the economy’s long-term growth prospects. 
There are signs that officials in the UK and the United States are starting to move in this direction. 
This would at least keep the economy afloat pending the development of the longer-term investment program. 
It would be better if such schemes could be agreed upon by all by G-20 countries, as was briefly the case in the coordinated stimulus of April 2009. 
If not, groups of countries should pursue them on their own. 
The European Union desperately needs a growth strategy. 
The recipient governments will have to cut their spending; the banks will have to take large losses. 
In the long run, the eurozone must be recognized as a failed experiment. 
It should be reconstituted with far fewer members, including only countries that do not run persistent current-account deficits. 
The Wall Blocking the Roadmap 
The roadmap to peace between Israelis and Palestinians faces countless bloody detours. 
Few Israelis expect Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas to deliver security to Israel, or to implement far reaching political and financial reforms. 
Security remains the critical component in the first phase of the roadmap for both parties. 
The roadmap calls upon the Palestinians to take steps that would bring violence to an end. 
The Palestinian security services are discovering that they lack the capacity to do so without risking civil war. 
But even if they could disarm the extremists, Palestinians are divided about how far they are willing to go to attain security for Israel. 
But Israelis do not accept this political logic. 
For them, such developments look like a trap that would consolidate the ``infrastructure of terror.'' 
This is where Israel's wall of separation comes in. 
They do not want to deal with the Palestinians, and so are erecting a physical barrier through areas that are now nominally under Palestinian control. 
While the roadmap speaks volumes about security, it makes no mention whatsoever of the Israeli wall. 
Yet the wall and the second phase of the roadmap, which calls for a Palestinian state with provisional borders, cannot co-exist. 
Work on the wall started around a year ago. 
For example, the planned portion of the wall that reaches the settlement of Ariel, deep inside the West Bank, extends 15 kilometers inside Palestinian territories. 
This is because the second phase, which still has to be achieved, calls for a Palestinian state with contiguous but provisional borders. 
The projected path of the wall eliminates Palestinian contiguity altogether. 
So continuing its construction will kill any Palestinian enthusiasm for the second phase of the roadmap. 
If Israel must have its wall, it must also restrict it to the 1967 Green Line. 
If not, no wall will be able to contain Palestinian rage. 
The Walls of August 
MOSCOW – History’s milestones are rarely so neatly arrayed as they are this summer. 
Fifty years ago this month, the Berlin Wall was born. 
Somewhat miraculously, a reformer who wanted Russians to be part of the democratic West had come to power in the Kremlin. 
But, in August 1991, ordinary Muscovites stood their ground. 
They defied the coup makers, and in the end carried with them much of the Russian Army. 
With their defiance, the coup was doomed. 
Berliners never stood a similar chance in the face of Soviet power. 
Khrushchev had assented to Ulbricht’s plea that only a physical barrier would maintain the viability of the East German state. 
But five years after the brutal suppression of the demands for freedom heard in Budapest, Khrushchev was not fully convinced of the need to divide Berlin. 
Khrushchev was considering his own political fortunes as well. 
Brinkmanship of the sort that took place as the Wall went up is usually the product of a politician desperate to shore up his domestic position. 
The irony for Khrushchev was that, though the hardliners wanted the Wall, they later included his indecisiveness about the Wall on the charge sheet used to force his removal in 1964. 
His decision preserved Soviet rule in East Germany for decades, but contributed to his own political demise. 
When Gorbachev allowed the Wall to be breached and then demolished, he alienated the bulk of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union even more than Khrushchev had. 
Indeed, Gorbachev once told me how Nicolae Ceauşescu, Romania’s dictator, called him to request that tanks be sent into Berlin to preserve the Wall. 
But Gorbachev, though still a believer in communism, refused to maintain the Soviet empire at the barrel of a gun. 
The coup leaders of August 1991 viewed Gorbachev’s ouster the same way Ulbricht had regarded his demand for the Wall – as the only means to preserve communist rule. 
When the West tried to warn Gorbachev that a coup was coming, it was already too late. 
Had the Wall not been built in 1961, would communism have collapsed sooner? 
Had Gorbachev responded to Ceauşescu’s plea and sent troops to defend the Wall, would communism in Europe ever have collapsed? 
These are unanswerable questions. 
The world has Vladimir Putin to thank for that lesson. 
The War Against Iraq’s Children 
Iraq’s children have suffered more than just successive wars and economic sanctions. 
The loss of parents and family resources has boosted child labor, homelessness, and inclinations towards violence and rebellion. 
They often now live in homes where 25 people live in a space of 40 square meters. 
Even intact families may comprise parents and five children in a single six-meter room. 
The increase in child labor reflects families’ dire economic situation: children are frequently a family’s only breadwinners, and they work cheap. 
Contractors in municipal services, for example, prefer to use children in order to cut costs. 
Here, a child may be used for agricultural labor or for janitorial work. 
Many work in piles of garbage, either removing them to another place or collecting empty bottles and cans to sell. 
Two children may unload a truck carrying 1,000 kilograms of food items. 
Not surprisingly, Iraq’s child workers suffer from a wide array of serious health problems. 
And all working children are vulnerable to malnutrition, as their diet typically lacks the items necessary to build body tissues. 
Nor is there any official authority to protect children and defend their rights in case of incapacitation or sickness. 
Indeed, Iraqi children are exposed to beating without regard for their age and for myriad reasons, thus growing up insecure, hostile, and violent. 
The deterioration of families’ financial situation has also left poor children deprived of educational opportunity. 
The small number of schools, the poor condition of buildings, and the collapse of relationships between students and teachers is also at fault. 
Older children sit in classrooms with much younger children, growing frustrated and violent, rather than becoming role models for others to emulate. 
Iraqi girls suffer no less than boys – and often more. 
At one end of the spectrum of deprivation, their opportunities are more constrained. 
They must perform household chores and are subject to beating if they do not carry out orders issued by male family members. 
In poor households, they are also likely to receive less food than boys, placing their physical health and development at even greater risk. 
At the other end of the spectrum, rape, adultery, early child bearing, and abortion have become ordinary matters. 
Increasingly, Iraqi girls interpret anything given to them as a means to have sex with them. 
Having lost their homes and parents, they sleep in alleys, sell cigarettes or newspapers, and beg. 
Simply put, children in Iraq have been reduced from human beings worthy of care to tools of production and instruments of violence. 
We are quite literally breeding a new generation of disorder. 
The War Against Iraqi Women 
Islamist leaders have imposed new restrictions on women, including prohibitions on work, bans on travel without a muhram (male guardian), and compulsory veiling. 
Now there are even “no woman zones” in some southern cities controlled by Islamist parties and tribal leaders. 
Honor killings of Iraqi women are justified by alleged promiscuity or adultery. 
Indeed, a top police official in Basra reported that as many as 15 women are killed every month in the city. 
Ambulance drivers in Basra, paid to “clean the streets” before people go to work, pick up many more bodies of women every morning. 
Ironically, the forces leading this assault on women had little or no power under Saddam Hussein. 
Some members of these groups now serve in government, others in militias or as self-appointed vigilantes or hired guns. 
The goal of the PVPV is to confine women to the domestic realm and end all female participation in public and political life. 
To date, Iraqi officials have not been willing to deal with this escalating violence against women, or even to discuss it. 
But, as elected representatives, they are obligated to address these crimes. 
So must the US. 
Two measures are urgently needed. 
First, the Iraqi government must immediately establish “Protection of Women” security patrols in Iraq’s southern cities. 
These patrols must receive gender-sensitive training and prioritize women’s security over tribal or fundamentalist religious values. 
Unless the US does so, it must withdraw from Iraq, because the occupation would merely continue to sustain a breeding ground for violence against women. 
The timetable for action is not subject to debate. 
The War for Oil 
Despite appearances, none of these objectives has changed under the Bush administration. 
Many observers believe that Bush has set a new course because the invasion of Iraq seems to fly in the face of these objectives. 
This, in turn, would mean an increase in US dependence on imported oil, especially from the Middle East. 
But America's interest in Iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or energy policy. 
The Bush administration recognized that, above all, Iraqi oil is a critical geopolitical asset. 
Whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq. 
Saddam's power came from his control of the world's second largest oil reserve. 
He understood perfectly the role that oil played in his power. 
Faced with the possibility of invasion and defeat, Saddam threatened to burn Iraq's oil fields. 
As the US planned its invasion, securing the oil fields became a critical priority. 
Iraq's future depends directly on the fate of Iraqi oil production. 
The logic is simple. 
The US must use oil revenues to lift the burden of financing regime change in Iraq from American taxpayers. 
All reconstruction plans depend in the long run on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities. 
If Iraq does not deliver its oil, President Bush cannot deliver on his promises to the Iraqi people, the American people, or the world community. 
Before the invasion, Iraq's oil production capacity reached three million barrels per day. 
Iraq will not be able to increase its production to that level within the time frame needed to establish an Iraqi government. 
Any increase in Iraqi oil production requires developing the oil fields, which means big investments, a legal and representative government, and political stability. 
Not even the Bush administration expects these requirements to be met soon. 
Indeed, political stability is the main condition for increasing production capacity. 
Needless to say, the situation may play out differently. 
Tensions may remain high for years. 
No one should be surprised, moreover, if Iraqi oil production suddenly stops altogether even under a democratic government. 
History suggests that labor strikes and similar disruptions that can halt oil production are a greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries. 
If Iraq cannot quickly increase its production capacity in the next few years, this will hinder both US foreign and energy policies. 
How will the US finance the long-term reconstruction of Iraq? 
Who will pay to maintain a fragile Iraqi democracy? 
Can the US sustain its occupation if it cannot provide food, health care, and other basic services to Iraq's people? 
These are tough questions, and they are fundamentally unanswerable until a stable, democratic regime in Iraq can control and ensure a steady flow of oil exports.
