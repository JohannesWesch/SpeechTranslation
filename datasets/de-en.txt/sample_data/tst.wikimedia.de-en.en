The Miller Arnold case is a legal case during the reign of Frederick the Great that considers the implications of judicial independence 
Case description 
However, the other judges at the Kammergericht refused to sentence their arrested fellow judges of the Kammergericht. 
Thus, Frederick himself sentenced the judges to one year's imprisonment in the Spandau Citadel and awarded damages to Arnold. 
The judges in question were then pardoned by the king on 5 September 1780, after serving two-thirds of their sentences. 
Subsequently, after this judicial scandal, the codification of the Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preußischen Staaten was further advanced and the role of the king in relation to the judiciary in Prussia was reconsidered. 
It was less a question of whether the miller was right in his assertions, and more a question of whether the king should have intervened. 
Evaluation and legend formation 
Whether the miller was actually right can probably no longer be clarified: there are some voices that argue that the king did not intervene unjustly, but rather gave validity to the law in the face of professional arrogance of the judges of the time. Others, on the other hand, agree with the judgea and criticize both the king's approach and the creation of legends resulting from the case. 
This legend aims to prove the kindness and justice of Frederick II towards his subjects by means of this case. 
According to the biography of Joachim Nettelbeck [de], the case became known as far away as Lisbon and Frederick II was celebrated internationally as a just ruler. The legend was mistakenly associated with the Historic Mill of Sanssouci, although that was not a water mill, but a windmill. 
Further reading 
The miller Arnold from Pomorsko in the Oderbruch operated a water mill on a body of water flowing to the Oder. 
He was a tenant farmer and thus owed the ground rent to his hereditary lord Count Schmettau, which he paid from the proceeds of the water mill. 
One day, however, a landowner of the noble family von Gersdorff, who owned land upstream, created a carp pond. 
As a result, the river (allegedly) carried very little water, which is why the miller claimed that he could no longer continue his business and therefore could no longer pay the ground rent to his lord. 
In 1773, Count von Schmettau obtained a judgment against the miller from a patrimonial court [de] (where he himself had the Gerichtsherrschaft [de]). 
Arnold now turned to a court in Küstrin, which, however, confirmed the verdict. 
In 1778, the mill was sold by court auction, and von Gersdorff acquired it. 
Arnold wrote submissions to Frederick the Great who later also heard him. 
The king ordered an investigation and finally gave instructions to allow the miller to sue for damages. 
However, the Regional Court of Küstrin and the Kammergericht also ruled against the miller in this regard. 
Thereupon Frederick II had the judges of the Kammergericht, the Landgericht Küstrin and the Patrimonialgericht arrested and imprisoned on the grounds that they had pronounced unjust sentences. The king reasoned 
Darnach mögen sich die Justiz-Collegia in allen Provinzen nur zu richten haben, und wo sie nicht mit der Justiz ohne alles Ansehen der Person und des Standes gerade durch gehen, sondern die natürliche Billigkeit bei Seite setzen, so sollen sie es mit Sr. Königl. M. zu thun kriegen. 
Denn ein Justiz-Collegium, das Ungerechtigkeiten ausübt, ist gefährlicher und schlimmer, wie eine Diebesbande, vor der kann man sich schützen, aber vor Schelmen, die den Mantel der Justiz gebrauchen, um ihre üblen Passiones auszuführen, vor die kann sich kein Mensch hüten. Die sind ärger als die größten Spitzbuben, die in der Welt sind, und meritiren eine doppelte Bestrafung. 
The judicial colleges in all provinces may only be guided by this, and if they do not go straight through with justice without regard to person and rank, but set aside natural equity, they shall have to deal with HRH. For a judicial college that practices injustice is more dangerous and worse than a gang of thieves, from whom one can protect oneself, but from rogues who use the cloak of justice to carry out their evil passions, from whom no man can beware. They are worse than the biggest scoundrels in the world and deserve a double punishment. — Frederick the Great 
On 18 December 1779, the Prussian Minister of Justice Karl Abraham Zedlitz received instructions from the king: 
Von Seiten des Criminalcollegii werde über diese 3 Leute nach der Schärfe der Gesetze gesprochen und zum mindesten auf Cassation und Vestungsarrest erkannt, wobey ich auch gleich zu erkennen gebe, daß, wenn das nicht mit aller Strenge geschieht, Ihr sowohl als auch das Criminalkollegium es mit mir zu thun kriegen werden! On the part of the Criminal College, these three people will be judged according to the severity of the laws and at least recognized as being subject to cassation and confinement, whereupon I also immediately indicate that, if this is not done with all severity, both you and the Criminal College will have to deal with me. — Frederick the Great

Helene Richter (4 August 1861 in Vienna – 8 November 1942 in the concentration camp Theresienstadt[1]) was an austrian anglicist, scholar of theatre studies and a theatre critic. 
Awards 
The German association for English studies awards the Helene-Richter-Award for dissertations, doctorate theses or comparably sophisticated scientific works, which distinguish themselves by intense research, clarity in structure and argumentation, meaningfulness of results, great textual proximity, and fluent language.[1] 
Richter-Library 
In 1942, due to pressure by Nazi Germany, the library of the two sisters, which consisted of around 3.000 books, was sold to the University of Cologne. 
After the correspondence with the library was found within archives, it is being reconstructed, republished and – if at all possible – redistributed to inheritors as part of the Nazi provenance research efforts.[1]

Like her younger sister Elise Richter, she was taught by a Prussian, northern German private teacher. 
The girls were raised "religiously, yet nondenominational". 
The family celebrated Christmas and attended "all kinds of church service, except the Jewish ones."[1] Because women were denied academic education at the time, she was self-taught and started studying Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1886. 
After the death of her parents, she lived together with her also unmarried sister Elise, who would later become teacher of Romance studies, the first woman to achieve Habilitation qualification and the first (extraordinary) professor at the University of Vienna. 
They both received the substantial inheritance of their father, which enabled them to build a house in the cottage district of Währing as well as to go on many trips throughout Europe and northern Africa.[1][2] Starting in 1891, the sisters attended the University of Vienna as guest auditors. They attended lectures by professors such as the philologist Theodor Gomperz[3] and the lector of Romance studies Adolf Mussafia.[2] 
In 1892, Helene Richter published an article about Shelley's 100th birthday in the Vossische Zeitung. 
In 1897, she wrote an essay about "Mary Wollstonecraft, die Verfacherin der Rechte der Frau" (Mary Wollstonecraft, the defender of women's rights) in the social democrat Arbeiter-Zeitung. 
Starting in 1906, the Richter sisters hosted a weekly salon for well-known scholars and artists to meet. 
Such scholars and artists include popular women's right activists Marianne Hainisch and Rosa Mayreder, the music critic Max Kalbeck, the writer Richard Kralik, the director of the Burgtheater Hugo Thimig and the philologist Hans von Arnim.[1] In January 1911, Helene and Elise Richter were baptised in the Lutheran City Church of Vienna.[2] 
Working for the Shakespeare Yearbook lead her to be a theatre critic. 
In 1926, she was appointed as the "biographer of the Burgtheater".[1] 
By virtue of her achievements and on the occasion of her 70th birthday, the Heidelberg University and the University of Erlangen awarded her an honorary doctor's degree. 
In the same year, she was appointed as an honorary citizen of Vienna.[1] 
After the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, in march 1938, her teaching license was revoked and she received a ban from going to libraries. 
In the times following the annexation, she had to sell her private English library. 
In March 1942, she, along with her sister, was forced to move to a Jewish retirement home. 
Both were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. She died on November 8th of the same year[1] 
Gerry Gibbs (born 15 January 1964 in New York City) is an American jazz musician (drums, percussion).[1] 
Gerry Gibbs is the son of jazz-vibraphonist Terry Gibbs. He grew up in Southern California and received his first drum set from Buddy Rich at the age of four. 
At the age of seven Gibbs had his first appearances on television shows such as The Steve Allen Show, in which he was allowed to play a three-minute solo in 1971. 
His first recordings were made in 1987 when he performed in his father's band with Buddy DeFranco in the Chicago club The Jazz Showcase, released on their album Chicago Fire. 
In the following years he played with John Campbell, Steve Amirault (That's What, with Seamus Blake), in the Terry Gibbs Quartet with Uri Caine, and with Jed Levy (Sleight of Hand, with George Colligan and Ron McClure). 
In late 1995, Gibbs recorded his debut album The Thrasher with his sextet, which included Ravi Coltrane, Joe Locke, Billy Childs, Mark Feldman, and Darek Oleszkiewicz. This was followed in 2009 by Moving On, Never Looking Back, with Justin Vasquez, Rob Hardt, Eric Hargett, and Andy Langham. 
In later years he worked with Ted Falcon, Joe Negri, Jim Butler, Robert Sanders, Doug Webb and with Eric Hargett and Joey DeFrancesco. In 2010 a tribute album was created for the "electric" Miles Davis. 
With Kenny Barron and Ron Carter he formed his Gerry Gibbs Thrasher Dream Trio, which has released three albums since 2013.

The European Climate Initiative (EUKI) is a funding instrument of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). 
The overall objective of the EUKI is to promote cooperation in the European Union (EU) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
The European Climate Initiative finances cross-border climate action projects of public and civil society actors such as non-governmental organizations, scientific institutes and municipalities. 
More than 300 implementing organizations and implementing partners are active in the projects.[1] The funding volume amounts to 79 million euros.[2] The EUKI forms the link between the National and the International Climate Initiative. 
Project funding 
There are two ways to receive funding or contracts under the EUKI: The annual, EU-wide call for project ideas selects organizations with future-oriented ideas for European climate action. 
In addition, the German Federal Ministry for the Environment finances specific projects that pursue predefined climate policy goals. 
The target groups of the bilateral and multilateral measures to be funded are governments, local authorities, civil society, consumers and - where permitted under state aid law - the industry. 
Geographically there is a focus on cooperation with Central, Eastern, South Eastern and Southern Europe.[1] 
Call for Project Ideas 
Once a year, the EUKI publishes a call for project ideas in which committed actors and cross-border networks within the EU can apply for funding. 
Innovative climate action ideas from non-governmental organizations, public authorities, non-profit companies and scientific and educational institutions are selected for funding. 
Projects are sought in which partners from two or more EU countries work together. 
The EUKI funds the majority of its projects through the call for project ideas which is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on behalf of the BMWK. 
Tenders 
Within the framework of tenders the BMWK commissions selected projects and studies. 
These are intended to contribute to the direct implementation of agreements with EU partner countries and climate policy goals of the German government in Europe. 
The concept development for these projects takes place in consultation with the respective partner countries within the framework of bilateral initiatives. 
In addition, the ministry awards contracts for the scientific monitoring and evaluation of the EUKI as well as for the support of the BMWK in questions of EU climate policy. 
In addition to funding, EUKI supports the strengthening of methodological, technical and commercial competencies as well as the dissemination of knowledge on climate action. 
Corresponding training events are offered within the framework of the EUKI Academy[1]. The EUKI also promotes the networking of implementers and thus contributes to the establishment of a community of practice of committed experts in climate action across professional and national borders. 
EUKI regularly offers webinars on climate-relevant topics such as climate policy or structural change in coal regions. 
In addition, there are further training courses on methodological topics such as project management or public relations. 
EUKI also publishes results and studies of the funded projects. 
Thematic priorities and project examples 
The European Climate Initiative promotes ideas for cross-border EU-wide climate action. 
The projects are assigned to eight thematic areas:[1] 
Climate Policy Energy Buildings and Municipalities Mobility Agriculture, Soils and Forestry Awareness Climate-aligned Finance Sustainable Economy 
Website of the European Climate Initiative Information on Project Funding through EUKI 2022 E-Paper: Climate Action Connecting Europe Video about the European Climate Initiative Angela Merkel about the European Climate Initiative 
In November 2016, the German government decided to fund the European Climate Initiative and made funds available for the 2017 federal budget. 
In May 2017, the EUKI Secretariat established its office at the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). 
A few months later, in September 2017, the first projects started their work. 
From the 6th ideas competition, 25 projects were selected for funding[3]. The 7th EUKI call for project ideas will start in November 2022. 
In March 2019, German Chancellor Angela Merkel mentioned the European Climate Initiative in her weekly video podcast, praising the work of the initiative and its projects.[1] 
Objectives 
The overall objective of the EUKI is to promote cooperation within the European Union to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
The work focuses on three approaches to support public and civil society actors in climate action and to initiate a transformative change in Europe to mitigate greenhouse gases. 
Specifically, the EUKI pursues three approaches[1]: 
Raise awareness and bundle knowledge Build networks and share models of success Build capacities and bridges to EU funding 
She was the Austrian first woman to earn a doctorate in civil engineering and in 1973 became the first female associate professor at the Vienna University of Technology. 
Early life and education 
In 1963, her habilitation (post doctorate degree) at the Vienna University of Technology looked at the fields of elasticity and material strength theory. Tungl was the second woman to habilitate at this university,[3] and the first woman to habilitate in these fields.[1] She is thought to have been the first female civil engineer in Europe to hold a doctorate.[6]

View of the prison complex on the Weser from Klüt around 1900 
Hamelin Prison, also known as the Stockhof, was a prison and penitentiary in Hamelin. 
It was located between the old town and the Weser. 
The listed[1] prison buildings are used for hotel operations. 
156 people were executed as war criminals during this period. 
Among them were the concentration camp guards Irma Grese, Elisabeth Volkenrath and Johanna Bormann, who were convicted in the Belsen trial, the camp commander Josef Kramer, and the concentration camp doctor Fritz Klein. 
Other executions due to Allied trials involved the concentration camp doctor Rolf Rosenthal, Hans Körbel and Benno Orendi, Vera Salvequart ( Kapo in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp), the SS guards Ruth Neudeck, Dorothea Binz, Elisabeth Marschall and Emma Zimmer, the former battalion commander of the 12th SS Panzer Division Bernhard Siebken and Fritz Knöchlein, chief of the 4th Company of the 2nd SS Totenkopf Regiment. 
Another 44 people were executed for violating the laws of occupation. 
Among them were 42 former forced labourers, some of whom were from Eastern Europe. 
The last execution in Hamelin was on December 6, 1949 on the Pole Jerzy Andziak (a displaced person) for the use of firearms resulting in death. 
In 1955 the Hamelin prison was closed and the inmates were transferred to the Justizvollzugsanstalt Celle prison. 
On October 1, 1958, the prison became a juvenile detention centre, whose prisoners were transferred to the newly established Hameln juvenile detention center in Tündern in 1980. 
This ended the prison operations. 
In 1986 the cell building, east and west wings of the facility were demolished. 
The remaining parts were converted into a hotel, which opened in August 1993.

The penal institution dates back to the Stockhof built in 1698. 
It housed prisoners condemned to build a fortress. 
The name comes from the fact that the prisoners were tied to stocks in their dormitory at night to prevent escapes. 
A new prison was built in 1713 because of overcrowding. 
In 1827 a new building was built on the former site of the Hamelin Fortress directly on the Weser, from which some of the remaining remains of the building originate. 
There were three wings and outbuildings. 
This was the Royal Penitentiary, which became a Prussian prison in 1866. 
Nazi era 
Plaque in front of the prison 
From 1933, during the Nazi period, hundreds of political prisoners were imprisoned in addition to around 500 criminal prisoners. 
According to the National Socialist rulers, it was primarily communists and social democrats , but also homosexuals and Jews. 
In 1935 the outer walls were raised and the institution was converted into a penitentiary. 
During the Second World War, political prisoners from France and Denmark were added, also as Nacht-und-Nebel prisoners. 
At the end of the war, on April 5, 1945, while the city was being shelled, the SS ordered the prison to be evacuated and the camp to be walked to Holzen subcamp , which became a death march along the Iths for many prisoners.[1]

Dan McCrum ist a financial journalist of the Financial Times.[1] 
Together with Stefania Palma he was involved in uncovering the Wirecard accounting scandal and is considered to be the key person who brought Wirecard down. Due to his research on Wirecard, he was threatened and defamed by Wirecard. In 2019, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) filed charges not against Wirecard for fraud, but against McCrum on suspicion of stock manipulation. 
In total, Dan McCrum researched the Wirecard case for over 6 years in his "House of Wirecards" series. In the Netflix documentary "Scandal! 
The fall of Wirecard", the background to the Wirecard scandal as well as the work and impact of Dan McCrum and short-sellers are illuminated, who also have their say in interviews.

In 1910 he joined the Royal Photographic Society (RPS). 
In the same year, the RPS organised his first solo exhibition in London. 
A year later, he became a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. 
From then on, Keighley's work was presented in many solo and group exhibitions. 
In 1924 he became an honorary member of the RPS. 
For fifty years, Keighley would each year produce five to six pictures of the highest artistic quality - an astonishing achievement at the time.[1] In the summer of 1943, the RPS exhibited a large-scale retrospective of Keighley's work at Bradford Art Gallery, showing the development of his work. 
After his death in 1947, the RPS also organized an exhibition in his honor in London. 
equipment 
At the beginning of his career, Keighley used a full-plate camera. 
Keighley had an assistant to help him with his equipment.[1] His camera had a "Goerz-Celor" anastigmatic lens with a lens hood and a yellow filter. 
The focus was fixed at 10 meters.[2] 
The advent of faster photographic emulsions and hand-held cameras meant that shorter exposure-times could be used. 
From then on, Keighley used a 1/4 plate box camera from then on. 
The camera was so small (compared to full-plate cameras) that it looked like a small brown parcel. 
Keighley made use of this inconspicuousness on his many travels, as many of the natives of the countries he visited were suspicious of the camera's 'evil eye'.[1] 
working method 
Keighley liked to photograph nature, and people in natural surroundings. 
He also sometimes tried to capture and depict 'mystical' objects. 
Most of his pictures were taken outside of the UK. 
Keighley enjoyed photographing abroad and he made annual trips to new countries. 
He photographed in (amongst others) France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, South Africa, and China.[1] 
Early on in his photographic career Keighley used sharp focus. 
His first prints were made using albumen paper. 
He would go on to experiment with different processes, using platinum, oil, bromine oil and gum bichromate. 
Eventually, Keighley would come to mainly use of charcoal for his prints.[1] 
Keighley would enlarge his 'quarter-plate' negatives to produce full-plate-sized prints. 
He would combine several different negatives to produce a print. 
Alexander Keighley was the son of a wealthy Yorkshire mill owner. 
His father, Joseph Keighley, was of knightly descent.[1] Keighley studied at the Keighley Trade and Grammar School, which later came to be known as the Mechanics Institute. 
The institute placed an emphasis on science and practical skills. Keighley was particularly interested in biology and won a scholarship to continue his scientific studies at the School of Mines (later the Royal College of Science) in London. 
He was particularly enthusiastic about the lectures by Thomas Huxley, with whom he studied biology, geology and botany.[2] In 1879 he became a founding member of the Keighley Scientific and Literary Society.[3] Keighley then planned to study medicine, but no sooner had his courses finished than his father obliged him to join the family business. 
Keighley would go on to become a director of the Sudgen Keighley Company in 1886 and remain so until his retirement in 1923.[3] 
He would also intensify dark tones when he felt it necessary, eliminating unwanted details, adding accents and playing with tonal variations to create the desired atmosphere.[1] He sometimes retouched his charcoal engravings so much that one could only guess at the negative that had produced it. 
Because of this his pictures were often referred to as "camera-paintings".[2]

Keighley as an Artist 
photographic career 
When Keighley gave his first public lecture on the geology of Airedale, at a Yorkshire Naturalist's Union outing in 1883, he saw a geologist using the new photographic dry plate.[1] This inspired Keighley to obtain some photographic equipment and set up a darkroom in the attic.[2] 
He started by photographing his family and relatives, and their homes and gardens.[1] Influenced by Henry Peach Robinson's work and writings, he also tried his hand at pictorialist photography. 
Keighley soon joined the Bradford Photographic Society, which was mainly interested in the technical processes of photography. 
His first major success was in 1887, when he submitted twelve prints to a competition held by the journal The Amateur Photographer. 
Jury member P.H. Emerson would later criticize his then orientation towards sharp focus and called him a "gum-splodger". Despite this Keighley still managed to win, and be placed ahead of Alfred Stieglitz, who only achieved second place.[1] In 1889 he contributed four photographs to a major exhibition of the Photographic Society of Great Britain (later known as the Royal Photographic Society).[2] 
In 1892, Keighley joined a group of well-known amateur photographers who, due to insufficient recognition of their art, would go on to found the Linked Ring group. 
Herr und Hund (Copy 119 of the unique special edition, published in November 1919) 
Thomas Mann with Bauschan, sculpture by Quirin Roth in Gmund am Tegernsee, 2001 
Bauschan, whose name is taken from Fritz Reuter's novel Ut mine Stromtid and is probably a corruption of Bastian, was one of Thomas Mann's favourite dogs and the only one of his animals to become a protagonist in one of his works. 
The two poodles named Nico, which he kept in his later years, made their way into his diaries in much greater detail and at least one of them also appears in a film report about Thomas Mann, but they did not make a literary appearance. 
Bauschan lived for about four years in Thomas Mann's Munich villa [de] , which together with its surroundings forms the background of the story. 
In the winter of 1919/1920, signs of illness became apparent. 
On 26 December 1919, Erika and Klaus Mann took him to a veterinary clinic, after a "young man with a Schmissen and Dr. title" – according to Thomas Mann in the corresponding diary entry – had diagnosed distemper the day before, "distemper in the severe form now rampant, which also affects older dogs. 
Purulent pneumonia, but also nervous manifestations [...] prognosis cloudy". 
On 16 January 1920, Thomas Mann noted: "From the clinic, definitive report that B a u s c h a n [italics in the original] cannot be restored. 
Urine poisoning is also present. 
Painless killing is recommended and then also ordered by us." R. I. P. I quoted against K. as an epitaph: "It is true that luck has also been kind to him, For such a one dies more beautifully whom in life An everlasting song praised."" 
A Man and His Dog (German: Herr und Hund) or Bauschan and I is Thomas Mann's longest narrative along with The Transposed Heads (German: Die vertauschten Köpfe) ans was written in 1918. 
Its first edition was a private print and was published in November 1919 in Munich as a unique special edition of 120 numbered and signed copies. 
The proceeds went to writers in need. 
Content 
Thomas Mann describes his experiences with his chicken-dog mongrel Bauschan, who, as a half-starved, sickly puppy, succeeded the collie Motz, to whom the author also set a literary monument (albeit a far more modest one) in Royal Highness (Königliche Hoheit). 
Herr und Hund is one of the most insightful and humorous literary testimonies about domestic dogs – and their owners. 
It is divided into five chapters, the headings of which already indicate that this text by no means claims to be a literary work in the strict sense: He Comes Round the Corner (Er kommt um die Ecke), How We Got Bashan (Wie wir Bauschan gewannen), Notes on Bashan's Character and Manner of Life (Einige Nachrichten über Bauschans Lebensweise und Charakter) and The Hunting-Ground (Das Revier), which provides an unusually meticulous description of Mann's walking area around the Munich domicile in the then suburb of Bogenhausen. The largest space, however, i.e. just under half of the narrative, is taken up by the last chapter entitled The Hunting-Ground. 
The author also reveals why: "I describe it out of gratitude - out of gratitude for the rest it gave him after an exhausting morning of writing as a writer. 
As a rule, he spent the whole morning worrying and struggling (...), overcoming difficulties that only made things crunch, and then it was the hunt with Bauschan that distracted and exhilarated me, that awakened my spirits and restored me for the rest of the day, during which there was still a lot to be done. 
In the various episodes from living together with the animal, among other things, this is told, 
how exclusively Bauschan is fixated on his master as a reference person and how skilfully he tries to animate him to play together and to go on daily excursions; what a nerve-wracking task the waiting ofa dog can be; how exciting, ritual-formal, but above all unspeakably embarrassing the encounters with other dogs turn out to be; how Bauschan, following his hunting instinct, tracks down field mice and occasionally turns them into food mush; how one day a mentally confused sheep follows him wherever he goes; how he pursues pheasants, ducks, seagulls and rabbits, always with harmless results; how he knows how to infect even his master with his passion, even to put him into an almost atavistic hunting fever; the embarrassment the good animal gets into when, unexpectedly, he actually catches a pheasant, and what embarrassment his master gets into when a hare fleeing from Bauschan suddenly jumps into his lap; how Bashan once almost goes rogue when he meets a hunter in the flesh who shoots a duck, and how jealous his master can become when Bashan allegedly punishes him by withdrawing his love; how the relationship comes to an abrupt end when the master thinks he has to take the animal to a veterinary clinic because of "occult bleeding". 
But master and dog remain together. 
Bauschan has gotten over his illness and enjoys stable health.

The Orthotonophonium is a free reed aerophone similar to a Harmonium with 72 keys per octave, that can be played all diatonic key intervals and chords using just intonation. The instrument was created in 1914 by German physicist Arthur von Oettingen to advance his theories of harmonic dualism (now knows as Riemann theory). Etymology The word 'Orthotonophonium' is a portmanteau of the the Greek words ορθός = correct, τόνος = tone und φωνή = sound. 
Functionality 
When playing in equal temprement, beats are unadvoidable due to the Pythagorean comma. 
This interference can be advoided playing on an Orthotonophonium, since the pitch of a tone can be chosen such that only pure intevals are played. 
This is acheived by using a different tuning system - 72TET. Unlike a piano, where there are only twelve keys per octave, on an Orthotonophonium, the player has the choice of several pitches per tone. 
This eliminates enharmonics, since for example, a G♯ can be altered several cents higher than an A♭ 
Background 
The concept of true intonation keyboards traces back to the 16th Century, with the work of Italian musicologists Gioseffo Zarlino and Nicola Vicentino. 
Zarlino tried to reproduce meantone temperament in all keys on a single instrument, without having to retune it. 
To this end, Zarlino created an instrument called the Archicembalo, which used 19 tone equal temperament. 
The instrument used two manuals and thirty six keys per octave. 
Das erste Instrument dieser Bauart wurde erst 1914 entwickelt und gebaut.[1][2] 
The Venice State Archive, or State Archive of Venice, (italienisch Archivio di Stato di Venezia) located at Campo dei Frari, San Polo Venice. 
The Franciscan Monastery 
The Franciscan monastery goes back to a donation from Doge Jacopo Tiepolo in 1246. 
The Order was permitted to drain the lacus Badovarius or Badovariorum. 
The small lake was named after the neighboring palace of the Badoer family. 
The number of monks and the amount of donations grew rapidly, so that on April 28, 1250 the foundation stone could be laid. 
One of the largest Franciscan churches in Europe was built by the end of the 15th century. 
Therefore, the double convent building was also called domus magna or cà granda. 
The outer, larger monastery was dedicated to the Trinity, the inner, smaller monastery to Sant'Antonio. 
The order was dissolved in 1810. 
Beginnings 
The side of the archive facing away from the Frarikirche with the Calle dietro l'archivio (meaning: 'alley behind the archive') 
Jacopo Chiodo,[1] who preferred the baptismal name Giacomo Chiodo, worked as an archivist both before and after 1797. He tried to initiate the establishment of a central archive, to which both Vienna and Paris agreed. 
However, it was not set up initially, instead there were still three departments in different locations: the "political" archives were kept in San Teodoro, a branch managed by Carlo Antonio Marin, while the court files were moved to San Giovanni and Archival documents of the Treasury and the Domains stored in San Provolo. 
In 1815 Venice was returned to Austria, and in the same year the decision was made to set up a central archive. 
The state archive was created from 1817 under the name Archivio generale veneto, its first director was Chiodo, who retired in 1840. 
Actually, all archival material should be transferred to the current archive of the Austrians, but Chiodo managed to avert this. 
Between 1817 and 1822 the state files from the time of the Republic were brought there. 
In Napoleon's time, if they had not been taken to Paris and later to Vienna, they were spread over three locations. 
The state holdings from the period up to 1797 were originally located in the Doge's Palace, in the Procuratie or in the institutions at the Rialto Bridge. 
The files of the political organs were now in the Scuola grande di S. Teodoro, the court files were in San Zanipolo, while the economic files, especially those of the tax authorities, were in a palazzo near San Provolo. 
The notarial files were initially located at Rialto, but were relocated several times. 
From 1797, French and Austrian authorities were in the city, and their holdings were transferred to the State Archives. 
The state institutions that arose in the city from 1866, when the city became part of Italy, also bequeathed their holdings to the archive, which was now the state archive. 
In 1875 the archive expanded and incorporated the former monastery of Ss. 
Trinità and S. Antonio beyond S. Nicoletto ai Frari. 
Therefore, the cul-de-sac behind the monastery is now called Calle dietro l'archivio, (transl. the alley behind the archive). 
The archive was by no means open to the public for a long time. 
In 1825 Emmanuele Antonio Cicogna and in 1829 Leopold von Ranke had to ask the Emperor in Vienna for permission. 
At the same time, numerous documents and entire holdings migrated to Vienna or Milan. 
They were not brought back to Venice until 1837 and 1842. 
The diplomatic dispute over the stocks continued for a long time.[1] 
Expansion after 1866 
Branch of the State Archives on the Giudecca 
Significance 
Sign at the entrance to the branch 
In 1866 Venice became part of Italy. 
In 1876 the State Archives received part of the Palace of the Dieci savi alle decime in Rialto together with the adjoining Scuola dei Orefici. 
Carlo Malagola was director of the Bologna State Archive, before took the director position in Venice Archive. 
On November 4, 1966, the city experienced extreme flooding, which also endangered the archive holdings, which initially had to be placed on higher shelves. 
In the years that followed, protective measures were taken against future floods, and the convent of San Nicoletto was restructured. 
An enlarged reading room was created. 
In addition, the former summer refectory, which overlooks one of the two cloisters, was enlarged. 
That's where the financial files had been until then. 
Elements that had been installed at the beginning of the 20th century for structural reasons were removed during the conversion work, so that the room regained its original dimensions. 
The new reading room was opened in August 1989. 
At the same time, the main entrance was moved to Campo dei Frari. 
At the end of 2008, another flood threatened the security of the stocks. 
The branch on the Giudecca (Fondamenta della Croce, 17) was originally a Benedictine convent. 
This became state property in 1806, used as a prison from 1811, then as a tobacco warehouse. 
In 1925 the State Archives exchanged some buildings on the Giudecca of the Magistrato alle Acque for the Palace of the Dieci savi alle decime in Rialto, which had served as a subsidiary until then. 
However, these spaces proved to be unsuitable, and so the archive acquired the former Benedictine building in the 1960s. 
Some items from the main building, above all the items concerning the Rialto Bridge, were recorded, subjected to conservation measures and transferred to the Giudecca at the end of the 1970s. 
In the 1980s, the state archives occupied the Benedictine church as well as the monastery. 
The dependance mainly contains court files, but also police, prefectural and financial files from the 19th century. 
Principle of provenance, inventory records 
Teodoro Toderini, director of the archive who fell ill at the end of 1875 and died in 1876, was an advocate of the principle of provenance, which ultimately prevailed, while his successor Bartolomeo Cecchetti took a different view.[1] 
In 1994 a Guida generale was published[1], In 1997 the digital recording of the holdings began, which are to be gradually made available to the public via the Internet, albeit only partially. 
In December 2006, the Repertorio dei fondi e degli strumenti di ricerca was completed, which provides a general overview of the holdings. 
This is still not available online.[2] 
The locally created archival materials from the French and Austrian periods between 1797 and 1866 are also located there. 
There are also isolated documents from before 976. 
Ottoman Archive Dubrovnik Archive 
The more recent municipal holdings are in the Archivio storico del Comune di Venezia, while those of the parishes, the defunct dioceses and the patriarchate are in the Archivio storico del Patriarcato di Venezia. 
Also in the state archive are numerous holdings from monasteries and churches, professional associations and families, the six Scuole Grandi and the numerous Scuole piccole and the brotherhoods, notaries, etc. There is also a library with a stock of around 59,000 volumes. 
Headquarters is a former Franciscan monastery at the Frari Church in the Sestiere of San Polo. 
The house is not only the most important archive for Venetian history and that of Veneto, but also of the greatest importance for the entire area of ​​the former colonial empire, i.e., the area between the upper Adriatic and Cyprus. 
The same applies to the history of the Mediterranean area touched by Venice's foreign relations, the Black Sea, but also the North Sea area and the southern German cities. 
It is also the most important archive for the history of the Balkans until well into the Ottoman period.

The Forthlin Road Tapes (also known as The Braun-Kirchherr Tapes) are private recordings by The Beatles, performed at Paul McCartney's childhood home on Forthlin Road, Liverpool, in April and June/July 1960. 
These are the only known recordings with their bassist Stuart Sutcliffe at the time. 
On January 6, 1967, part of I'll Follow the Sun was played on German television in the program "The Beatles Zeiten in Hamburg". 
The source came from Hans-Walther Braun's tape. 
In 1994 Astrid Kirchherr gave her tape to George Harrison. 
In the late 1970s, probably in 1977, Kirchherr and Braun gave their tapes to Frank Dostal, a former member of the Rattles and Beatles acquaintance. 
Dostal technically revised both tapes in the Teldec studios in Hamburg and made three copies of the entire recordings, which he gave to Braun and Kirchherr; he kept a copy for himself. 
The existence of the tapes became known to a wider audience when Philip Norman published them in his 1981 book Shout! 
The Beatles in Their Generation. 
Norman wrote in his book, "The beats rise, their voices blend, and for a moment they are recognized for what they have become." 
At the end of the 1980s, the recordings were first released on bootlegs and became available for purchase. 
The bootleg vinyl album The Quarrymen at Home was released in Germany in 1987, followed by the double vinyl album Liverpool May 1960. The bootlegs contain all of the recordings from the tapes held by Astrid Kirchherr and Hans-Walther Braun. 
With the bootleg release, it was now audible that the sound quality was poor and that the individual songs were partly improvised. 
Because the Beatles recorded the recordings in mono, the individual instruments "smudged" into one another. 
In addition, some songs were recorded with clipping and background noise can be heard. 
The songs of the bootlegs were underlaid with reverb, among other things, the speed is too high, and some of the instrumental versions were artificially lengthened. 
Bootlegs with unedited material were released only in 2007. 
Charles Hodgson's grandson, Peter Hodgson, found the Beatles tapes in his grandfather's estate and sold them to Paul McCartney in March 1995. 
These recording tapes are intended to be the basis for release on the Anthology 1 compilation album. 
Publication 
The following tracks were officially released on the album Anthology 1 in November 1995: 
Hallelujah, I Love Her So is a 1956 composition by Ray Charles, released as a single A-side that same year. 
The song was part of the Beatles' live repertoire between 1960 and 1962. 
In April 1977 the live album Live! at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962, which includes a version sung by Horst Fascher. 
Origin 
The bootleg version of the song is 2 min 26 s long, the anthology version was cut to 1 min 13 s. 
You'll Be Mine is a short song by Lennon/McCartney from the early days of The Beatles. 
It's a humorous parody of vocal jazz group The Ink Spots. 
Paul McCartney sings in a deep baritone, interspersed with shrill falsetto backing vocals from John Lennon. 
The text cannot be fully understood due to the poor sound quality. 
The bootleg version of the song is 1min 45s long, the anthology version was edited to 1min 38s. 
Cayenne is an instrumental song composed by Paul McCartney alone. 
The bootleg version of the song is 2min 20s long, the anthology version was cut to 1min 14s. 
Entire track list of recorded songs 
The following list of tracks is arbitrary and does not reflect the exact chronology of the recordings. 
20 Forthlin Road, View of the terraced house 
The first release was in May 1969 on the album Let It Be. 
It was first released in November 1964 on the Beatles for Sale album. This version has a different bridge. 
Plaque on terraced house 
Grundig tape recorder TK20 manufactured 1958 
At the beginning of 1960 Stuart Sutcliffe joined the group, a permanent drummer was not found until August 1960 with Pete Best. 
In April 1960 the group called itself the Silver Beetles, in July 1960 they renamed themselves The Silver Beatles. 
From August 1960, the group removed the Silver suffix in the name and henceforth called themselves The Beatles. 
The tape recorder was borrowed from a neighbor of the McCartneys, Charles Hodgson. 
Some sources mention that Paul McCartney's brother, Michael McCartney, contributed some percussion by banging on a guitar case. 
According to Paul McCartney's recollection, the recordings took place in April 1960 in the McCartney family bathroom. 
Paul McCartney said of this in a 1994 interview with Mark Lewisohn: "Sometimes I would borrow a tape recorder, a Grundig with a little green eye, and we would kind of go to my house and try to record things [...] But they were very much home demos. 
Very bad quality." 
Further recordings were made in June or July 1960, again at McCartney's family home. Several copies were made of the tapes. 
A friend of the Beatles from Hamburg - Hans-Walther Braun -, Astrid Kirchherr and Charles Hodgson received tapes. 
It is not clear which songs were on Charles Hodgson's tape. 
The Hodgson tape is believed to have contained three songs from Kirchherr's and eleven songs from Braun's tape. 
In addition, there are said to be recordings of the songs Ask Me Why, When I'm Sixty-Four and Winston's Walk on Hodgson's tape, but these were not released legally or on bootleg. 
So it remains speculative whether the recordings exist.

Elmar Nass during a lecture (2022) 
In the tradition of Joseph Höffner and Oswald von Nell-Breuning, he argues for a form of social ethics based on natural law, for which he also provides an ecumenical profile in the spirit of normative humanism. 
With his thesis of objectively justifiable human dignity and the rights and responsibilities that can be inferred from this dignity, he builds bridges from Thomasian tradition to neo-Aristotelian approaches to justice (Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum) and to a Kantian ethics of reason. 
His aim is to use this coalition, which also transcends ideological boundaries, to counteract the relativization of human dignity. 
In his practical writings, Nass draws a line from liturgical performance to diaconal action and personal witness of faith. 
The focus is on the plausibility of Christian faith and action, as well as virtues of courage and hope oriented toward them. 
He has stated that vital Church reform must discover and foster core groups of faith that radiate outward.

Brann department store in Zurich, building part 1912, later extended 
Brann was a department store in Zurich that had other Swiss branches. 
Its assets now belong to the insurance group Swiss Life. 
Julius Brann, a then twenty-year-old former manager of a Zurich branch of the Knopf department stores, founded his own department store there in 1896. 
It was the first Swiss department store[1]. 
This was followed in 1897 by a branch in Basel and in 1899 by another in St. Gallen. 
In 1900, the Zurich department store Brann was moved to a larger new building on Bahnhofstrasse, created by the architect Richard Kuder.[1] In 1908, the company was converted from its previous legal form of a limited partnership into a stock corporation. 
From the mid-1930s, Julius Brann AG became the largest Swiss retail company with around 2200 employees.[3] 
In 1939, Oscar Weber took over the company and renamed it Oscar Weber AG in 1941. 
Between 1956 and 1966, additional stores were opened in German-speaking Switzerland. 
By the mid-1970s, the group owned twelve Weber department stores and several subsidiaries operating under other names, such as the "Regina" department store in Dietikon. 
Together with Neue Warenhaus AG (operating under EPA in German-speaking Switzerland and UNIP in French-speaking Switzerland), Oscar Weber AG was united under the umbrella of the Zurich-based Oscar Weber Holding (OWH). 
At the beginning of the 1980s, the Oscar Weber department stores disappeared from the townscape, mostly due to their conversion into EPA department stores. 
The department store was therefore spared the subsequent turbulence of OWH for a long time: the owner families Buhofer, Weber and Stöckli split up the holding company anew in 1995: Neue Warenhaus AG became the owner of the EPA properties, while EPA's department store business was spun off again into EPA AG, which was now formally only the tenant of the properties. 
All properties not occupied by EPA were combined in Oscar Weber AG. 
Due to close ties with Schweizerische Rentenanstalt, OWH was sold in mid-2001 to Rentenanstalt, which retained the real estate divisions, while the Buhofer family took over EPA's department store business, which it intended to continue under its own management..[1][2] 
On February 1, 2002, Coop acquired 40% of the share capital of EPA AG and announced in the fall that it intended to reorganize the EPA department stores with the Coop department stores (St. Annahof) to form uniform Coop City department stores. 
The sale of the Weber properties to today's Swiss Life also caught up with the Brann House in 2014. 
When the original Weber-Maus lease expired, Swiss Life demanded approximately three times the rent for a continuation of the lease, citing the overpriced local rents on Bahnhofstrasse. 
In a first-instance ruling, the Zurich rental court held that Swiss Life's so-called offer was unrealistic and had to be based not on arbitrary, customary local rents, but on customary local rents for department stores.[1] At the end of September 2019, Manor announced that it would be moving from its headquarters on Bahnhofstrasse due to a lack of agreement with the landlord.[2] Manor paid around CHF 6 million in rent for the property per year. 
Manor will move out at the end of January 2020. 
In the spring of 2020, Swiss Life plans to start the two- to three-year conversion work.[3]

Comparatively slightly damaged during the Second World War, business operations were resumed after the roof structure was rebuilt. 
From 1956 to 1958, the adjacent site on Krebsgasse/Schildergasse, which had previously housed the police headquarters that had been destroyed in the war, was redeveloped. 
According to plans by Wilhelm Riphahn, a high-rise building was erected there on Schildergasse, with the theater garage in the rear. 
As part of this urban redevelopment - in the neighborhood of the new opera house - the commercial building, now also called Ortloff-Haus, was extended by one axis to the east, rebuilt on the inside, raised by one storey and the attic extended. 
After further alterations in 1982, the building housed - in addition to Erich Ortloff GmbH & Co. KG, the building housed the City of Cologne's Surveying and Cadastral Office until spring 1999. 
After its relocation, another reconstruction followed. 
The Isay department store was entered in the list of monuments of the city of Cologne on November 9, 1984 (monument no. 2757). 
Isay family 
Alfred Isay served in the war and returned traumatized by a serious traffic accident. 
He began working again in the textile wholesale business Gebr. 
She volunteered to sew SS uniforms in a factory and was released as a result. 
In February 1943, the family was taken to the Hollandsche Schouwburg. 
Ludwig Mengel, a former tax official who had worked for Isay as a secretary since 1927 and was now a partner in the former Gebr. 
Isay OHG, was able to get the family to return to their home because of his connection to Ferdinand aus der Fünten. 
In June 1943, the family was deported to the Westerbork concentration camp. 
On July 12, Mengel appeared and told the camp commander Gemmeker that a bomb had fallen on the department store, important papers had been burned, and Alfred Isay urgently needed to come to Amsterdam for a meeting. 
Isay demanded that he could take his family with him. 
The family took advantage of this circumstance to go into hiding. 
Different Dutch families took them in separately. 
Eventually, they managed to survive in hiding.[1]:43 After the war, his widow and the children took Dutch citizenship. 
Architecture 
The former Isay department store is a listed building in Cologne's Altstadt-Nord district. 
The office and commercial building at Zeppelinstrasse 4-8 on the corner of Am Alten Posthof 3 was built between 1911 and 1913 to a design by the Cologne architectural firm Helbig & Klöckner. 
The client was the company Gebrüder Isay. 
1910 to 1933 
Bis zum Jahr 1910 war das Areal zwischen Neumarkt, Krebsgasse, Breite Strasse and Richmodstrasse were characterized in particular by military installations. 
These were, on the one hand, the military casino in the so-called Blankenheimer Hof and, on the other hand, the former Franciscan monastery ad Olivas on the street Am alten Posthof, which was used as barracks. 
After the acquisition of the area by the city of Cologne, the old buildings were demolished under the city architect Carl Rehorst and Zeppelinstrasse was built across this area. 
On both sides of the new street, commercial buildings were constructed by renowned architects, including Jacob Koerfer (Schwerthof), Hermann Eberhard Pflaume (Olivandenhof), Carl Moritz (Carl Peters department store), Emil Schreiterer & Bernhard Traugott Below (Schreiterer & Below; furniture store Gebrüder Schürmann), Otto Schulze-Kolbitz (Gustav Cords) and Paul Bonatz (Haus Reifenberg)..[1]:40 
The corner plot to the street Am alten Posthof was acquired by the company Gebrüder Isay, a wholesaler in cloth, wool and knitwear founded in 1871. 
The company commissioned the architectural firm of Helbig & Klöckner with the development of designs. 
From the preliminary designs, the clients selected a project that had four full stories with nine axes on Zeppelinstrasse and seven axes on Am Alten Posthof. 
The hipped roof, which terminates at the top, accordingly had four gables on the longer side and three on the shorter side. 
The main entrance is still located in the center of Zeppelinstrasse, the side entrance on the left outside Am Alten Posthof. 
The commercial and office building developed by the architects Rolf Helbig, Albert Klöckner and Oskar Rosendahl[1]:349 f. were by 1. April 1913 ready. 
At this time, the management of the company Gebrüder Isay, which continued to operate as a cloth, wool and hosiery wholesaler, was in the hands of Adolph, Siegfried and Alfred Isay. The 1930 address book now lists Adolph and Alfred Isay as the owners of Gebrüder Isay. 
According to this, the company dealt in tricot and hosiery.[2] In addition to the textile goods wholesaler Gebrüder Isay, the property accommodated eleven other companies or offices at this time. 
In addition to Alfred Wohl's office business, these included a deposit bank of A. Schaaffhausen'schen Bankverein as a branch of Deutsche Bank, the Cologne branch of "Ala" Anzeigen AG, which still had its branch in the building in 1938, the corset business of Gebr. 
Lewandowski GmbH, the manufactured goods wholesaler Ferdinand Mertznich, the silk goods wholesaler Katz & Levy, the Cologne branch of Telefunken Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie mbH and offices of the Prussian Land Registry Office Cologne III.[3]

At the end of 1949, it was time to make a decision, either to be a "perpetual refugee" or to return to Berlin to repair the war-damaged house. 
From 1951, the family lived in Berlin again. 
There H.L. Fischer-Nienburg re-established contact with the VBK and remained a member until about 1966, also serving as 2nd Chairman for about two years. 
From 1958 to 1960, he and other artists were jurors for the "Große Berliner Kunstausstellung" at the Radio Tower, which then became jury-free. 
From the 1960s onwards, he no longer organised exhibitions. 
He painted until the early 1980s. 
Works 
Hans Ludwig Fischer-Nienburg worked as a gallery of independent artists. 
His works can be assigned to different directions, from "Cool Romantic Realism" to "New Objectivity" to the completely free "Expressive". 
The emphasis is on portrait and landscape painting as well as still lifes, in addition to "socially thematic motifs". 
His portraits almost always have a romantic, cool objectivity, without straying into the abstract."

Career path 
One of his words of wisdom was this saying by Wilhelm Busch: 
"When one who with difficulty has barely Crawled up a tree, Thinks that he is a bird, He is mistaken." 
Fischer-Nienburg, Retrospective. 
Catalogue. 
He was born the fifth child of his parents Luise Fischer née Riechelmann and the teacher Ludwig Fischer. 
Together they had three daughters. 
Fischer attended primary school and grammar school in Nienburg until 1907, which he had to abandon due to laryngitis and operations. 
From 1907 Fischer was apprenticed to the painter Carl Plinke, and parallel to this he attended the School of Arts and Crafts in Hanover until 1910. 
He then studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich until 1912. 
After completing one year's military service he returned to Nienburg and set up a studio there in Werstler Park. 
At the outbreak of the First World War, he was sent with the pioneer battalion from Minden to the Western Front, among other places. 
There he attained the rank of lieutenant. 
He experienced the end of the war near Kiel, including the anarchic conditions during the revolution of the navy. 
After the war, Fischer moved back into his studio in Werstler Park, which he soon exchanged for a barn at the Bornemann dyer's family in Lange Straße, as the land in Werstler Park had been sold. 
The first exhibitions followed in Nienburg (1922) Hanover, Munich, Berlin etc. (see exhibitions). 
In the years up to 1929 Fischer-Nienburg, as he called himself from 1922, designed a colour concept for the old town of Nienburg and for the town's flag. 
For the Nienburg town hall, he designed the town hall hall hall with murals, and the storage cellar was converted into the Ratskeller according to his idea. 
During this time he undertook various study trips to Italy, Holland, Flanders and Paris. 
Through the exhibitions of his works in Berlin, he became known in the metropolis. 
In 1927 he got engaged, and in 1929 he married Margarete Heitmann in Nienburg, followed by a move to Berlin. 
They moved into a studio flat on Karolinger Platz. 
In Berlin-Nikolassee, the Fischer couple built a house with a studio, which they moved into in 1933. 
Fischer-Nienburg was a member of the traditional association "Berliner Künstler" (Berlin Artists' Association) from 1938 to 1966. 
A study trip took the couple to Italy in 1939. 
Various attempts to avoid being drafted into the Second World War as a World War I reserve officer failed. 
He served as a construction company commander from 1940 to 1945 and was seriously wounded. 
After being a prisoner of war, he reunited with his family in Hamelin, who had fled from Berlin. 
Diphtheria and a severe eye condition, which was alleviated by an operation in 1946, severely affected his further work. 
Many artists who had fled to Hamelin got together to support each other. 
The "Kunstkreis Hameln" (Hamelin Art Circle) was later formed from the various exhibitions through the co-initiative of H. L. Fischer-Nienburg. 
It was planned to design a colour plan for the old town of Hameln. 
In 1929, the company moved into the new factory buildings in Teningen, where a smelter and a strip rolling mill were set up. 
At the same time, an aluminum powder company was founded to recycle the aluminum waste. 
The powder factory was sold again in 1934. 
In 1937, Tscheulin started the production of aluminum tubes, and from 1938, pleated bottle capsules for champagne and wine bottles were manufactured. 
However, the main products were aluminum foils for the production of condensers and for packaging. 
To enhance the latter, the foils were laminated, dyed and printed. 
This also resulted in collectible pictures made of colorful aluminum foil, which were enclosed with cigarette packages. 
Tscheulin produced the cigarettes in a cigarette factory he founded at the time. 
The pictures could be pasted into a scrapbook entitled "German Fairy Tales in Words and Pictures," which had been published by Tscheulin. 
Another curiosity was the production of emergency money during the 1923 inflation, in which aluminum foil was printed instead of paper. 
Apart from the Singen aluminum rolling mills, Tscheulin was the only producer of such banknotes. 
From 1930 until the beginning of the war, Tscheulin worked tirelessly towards industrial development in Breisgau. 
In 1931, for example, he took over half the capital of the machine factory where he had learned his trade, thus saving it from insolvency. 
In 1932, under Tscheulin's mediation, a Frankfurt capacitor factory moved its headquarters to Teningen because considerable cost advantages could be achieved here for the production of aluminum electrolytic capacitors due to the low transport costs for the aluminum foil and technological cooperation. 
In June 1933, Tscheulin submitted an application for the construction of a raw aluminum plant to the Reich Ministry of Economics. 
As early as 1933, Berlin no longer permitted the establishment of plants that were important for armaments if they were located near the border. 
The application of Tscheulin, who wanted to invest one million RM, was not approved.[1] 
Nazi years 
From 1939 to 1945, aluminum foils were only allowed to be produced for war-related purposes. 
Emil Tscheulin received plenty of orders and produced 60 percent of the Reich's capacitor foils during the war.[1] This was only possible because his company employed forced laborers from various countries. 
Because protective regulations existed exclusively for German employees, especially for women, for example with regard to weekly working hours as well as night work, the companies were requested by the labor offices to use female Eastern workers for the night shifts. 
Usually, the companies were allowed to employ the female forced laborers at 62.75 hours a week. 
Tscheulin applied to be allowed to use his Eastern workers for 72 hours in production. 
The request was granted.[1] 
From 1945 to 1948, the plant was shut down. 
The production facilities were dismantled and the factory buildings were largely converted into French barracks. 
In 1949, Tscheulin was able to deliver the first tubes made of aluminum, and in 1950 the first rolling mills went into operation. 
In 1951, a few weeks before Emil Tscheulin's death, a new smelter and a blooming and strip rolling mill started operations. 
The plant founded by Tscheulin still produces printed films today, belonged to the Canadian aluminum producer Rio Tinto Alcan (RTA) until 2010 and has since been taken over by the Australian packaging specialist Amcor Flexibles. 
Political activity 
Emil Tscheulin was one of the early and most influential promoters of National Socialism in Baden and had been a supporter of the NSDAP since 1930, although he himself did not join the party as a member until 1932. 
He supported the Baden NSDAP with considerable sums of money.[1] In 1932, he also became head of the light metal goods section in the Freiburg Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK). 
Training and operations manager 
Tscheulin's role in building up the NSDAP in Teningen 
Tscheulin was the driving force behind the establishment of the NSDAP local group in Teningen. 
His promotion of National Socialism in Teningen was reported in detail in the official gazette of the municipality from 1938 onwards, which is why Tscheulin's activities are particularly well documented. 
In 1930, for example, he recruited a foreman employed in his company for the NSDAP, after the foreman had already campaigned for Tscheulin and against the Social Democratic municipal councilor Fritz Schieler in a regional newspaper a year earlier..[1]Tscheulin proposed his Werkmeister as NSDAP local group leader of the new local group to be founded. 
In the same year, the Werkmeister also founded the SA Emmendingen,[2] in which he made a career as a Sturmbannführer of the SA. 
An expression of Tscheulin's support of the NSDAP local group was the fact that of the first 67 party members in the village, 42 were employed in the aluminum plant. 
Tscheulin also bore the costs of the party work, granted the local group leader employed by him paid leave for his commitment to the NSDAP and in 1932 committed himself to the latter to pay for all costs incurred in hall battles of the Sturmabteilung, however, on the condition that the Teningen SA remained victorious.[1] 
The official gazette of the municipality reported retrospectively that the Tscheulin plant was already a "National Socialist stronghold" in the spring of 1932 and "literally a fortress from which the SA made its outbursts." 
In the aluminum plant "the weapons of the SA were stored, the files were seized and no police dared to touch the plant"..[1]Furthermore, tips for the storm flags were made in the aluminum plant and deadbeats were cast from aluminum.[2]Emil Tscheulin himself procured firearms, which he passed on to party comrades, although the SA, like the SS, was strictly forbidden to possess firearms. 
He also personally intervened on the side of the SA in their brawls with Social Democratic activists of the Reichsbanner..[3] 
An essential role in the establishment of National Socialist structures in Teningen was played by the founding of National Socialist Business Cell Organizations NSBO. 
With the NSBOs, the National Socialists attempted from 1931 to eliminate the influence of trade unions and Social Democrats in the factories, an objective that Tscheulin successfully implemented in his plant. 
NSDAP celebrities visit The close and early connection between Tscheulin and the NSDAP is also characterized by the NSDAP party celebrities, some of whom were received in the canteen of the aluminum plant in Teningen even before 1933:[1] 
Emil Tscheulin was the son of a molder in an iron foundry and machine factory. 
After attending elementary school from 1891 to 1899, he was hired as an apprentice in this company. 
There he received training as a machinist. 
After his technical abilities were recognized and encouraged, he also received commercial training. 
After completing his training, Tscheulin did military service and then, at the age of 22, became plant manager of the company where he had learned. 
President of IHK Freiburg 
After the NSDAP "seizure of power", Tscheulin became president of the Freiburg Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK), which was no longer independent, however, but subordinate to the Baden IHK in accordance with the Führer principle. 
He held this office until 1945. 
From 1940 to 1943, he was also president of the IHK Mulhouse and Kolmar, which had been brought into line after the annexation of Alsace. 
Among the business leaders of Baden, Tscheulin had some of the best contacts with the NSDAP Gauleiter Robert Wagner,[1] who from 1940 was also head of the civil administration in the reincorporated Alsace. 
As president of the IHK, Tscheulin also had to maintain contacts between industry and science, here especially with the University of Freiburg. 
In this connection, on his initiative, the IHK founded a working group for cellulose research in 1939 in support of the chemist and later Nobel Prize winner Hermann Staudinger, which was headed by Staudinger and which offered the latter the opportunity to establish a research department for macromolecular chemistry at the university. 
In other cases, however, Tscheulin did not shy away from attacking personalities he did not like and withdrawing his support from them, without any financial or professional reasons for doing so. 
Tscheulin disliked the economist Adolf Lampe, who was associated with the resistance and who, together with Walter Eucken, ran the "Oberbadische Wirtschaftsinstitut" (Upper Baden Economic Institute), which until then had worked closely with the IHK and was also supported by the Reich Ministry of Economics. 
Tscheulin refused to support the institute and it only remained because it was taken over by the university.[1] 
As president of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Tscheulin also played a role in the "Aryanization" of Jewish companies that should not be underestimated. 
The Chambers of Industry and Commerce had to provide expert opinions on the implementation of the "Aryanization" in the corresponding "proceedings" and had to approve the purchase agreement as well as the purchase price. 
Tscheulin apparently had considerable leeway in his decision-making and used this as late as 1942 in the case of Hans Mez, a Freiburg manufacturer of sewing silk, who was accused of being "half-Jewish". 
Tscheulin campaigned for Mez against various party circles, but was unsuccessful. 
In the proceedings against Metallwerk Oscar Weil G.m.b.H in Lahr, on the other hand, he came to a different decision, possibly due to private interests. 
The company, which still exists today, had 150 employees at the time and was the market leader in Europe for steel and aluminum wool, known among other things for its abrazo brand. 
The company had considerable importance in terms of armaments and foreign exchange policy. 
In 1938, the Jewish head of the company, Hugo Weil, applied to the Reich Chancellery for an exemption from the threatened "Aryanization" on the grounds that his cooperation could not be dispensed with because of his foreign contacts, so Tscheulin had to give his expert opinion. 
Tscheulin spoke out against Weil's request and the Reich Ministry of the Interior rejected his request for an exception. 
The attempt to transfer the management of the company to Weil's future "non-Jewish" son-in-law also failed, and the company changed hands on December 1, 1939. 
The new company owner was the director of the Tscheulin aluminum plant, Clemens Kentrup, a favorite of Gauleiter Robert Wagner and his Gau economic advisor from 1933 to 1945. 
Kentrup was Tscheulin's son-in-law and was probably financially supported by Tscheulin in the takeover of Weil's company.[1] 
As early as 1938, Tscheulin was appointed Wehrwirtschaftsführer, i.e. at a time when only deserving party comrades were given this title, which during the war was also awarded to industrial leaders who were not affiliated with the party. 
Despite his loyalty to the line, Tscheulin also criticized organizational grievances that resulted from rivalries between different party branches: "The juxtaposition, overlapping and confusion of the various forms of organization has in some cases caused such confusion that even clear-thinking people equipped with the best will can no longer find their way around.".[1] 
Honors 
After acquiring the license to produce sheet aluminum from Swiss aluminum industrialist Heinrich Alfred Gautschi, Maschinenfabrik founded an aluminum GmbH in 1910 together with Ludwigshafen-based iron wholesaler Wolf Netter & Sohn and entrusted Tscheulin with its technical management. 
In a start-up phase, the production process for aluminum foil was technically improved. 
The first foils were delivered as early as January 1911. 
Memorial plaque at the evangelic church in Köndringen 
Im Oktober 2017 distanzierte sich die Universität Freiburg durch einen Senatsbeschluss von der Ernennung Tscheulins zum Ehrensenator.[3] 
A response from the community pledged to commission historians to work on the case or assign a seminar paper at the university.[1] However, at the end of July 2012, the Teningen municipal council rejected the participation of the municipality in the historical reappraisal by scientists from the University of Freiburg..[2] 
On the other hand, it became known that Hans-Georg Otten-Tscheulin, a grandson of Emil Tscheulin, has commissioned a scientifically precise study in which Tscheulin's activities are to be investigated and documented. 
Otten-Tscheulin has pointed out that this privately financed expertise is not subject to any publication obligation, but has held out the prospect that it can be viewed after completion.[1] 
In order to deepen the clarification of the circumstances of the honors for Emil Tscheulin, the initiative DEMON "Think without Nazis" invited to a public event in Teningen in March 2013. 
Participants in the panel discussion were the historians Norbert Ohler and Wolfram Wette as well as Günter Stein from the organizer. 
Radio Dreyeckland, among others, reported on the event. [1] [2] 
Founder 
Ausgabe Nördlicher Breisgau vom 16. 
In 1912, Aluminium GmbH was merged with Dr. Lauber, Neher & Cie. in Emmishofen and Dr. Lauber, Neher Co. GmbH Singen to form Aluminium-Walzwerk AG (AWAG), headquartered in Schaffhausen and headed by the Swiss Robert Victor Neher. 
Neher had already developed a patent for the production of endless aluminum foil strips in 1910 and had also been producing using this process at the German site in Singen since 1912. 
His production method was technologically far superior to the book-rolling process used by Tscheulin. 
Since Tscheulin had lost his influence in the newly formed company, he and his brother-in-law Wilhelm Ingold founded their own company in Teningen in 1913 under the name Aluminium-Folien-Fabrik GmbH, where he continued to produce foil using the book-rolling process. 
During the First World War, production at this plant was severely restricted; at times, zinc was processed into foil instead of aluminum. 
For a short time, Tscheulin and Ingold were also drafted into the army as soldiers.[1] 
In 1919, Emil Tscheulin, Wilhelm Ingold and the owners of the Karlsruhe hardware store L. J. Ettlinger, Martin Elsas and Leopold Neumann, founded Breisgau-Walzwerk GmbH, Teningen.[1] With this new start, the company had also switched from the package or book rolling process to the strip rolling process. 
In 1926, AWAG in Schaffhausen, to which the aluminum plant in Singen also belonged, acquired L. J. Ettlinger's shares in the Breisgau rolling mill, and the Singen-based Aluwerke, headed by Hans Constantin Paulssen, took over the management of the plant. 
Tscheulin and Ingold left the reorganized company after a short period of affiliation and set up a new plant in Deißlingen, then in Württemberg, as they had contractually agreed not to settle in Baden for three years. 
During this time Tscheulin was also in the USA and Canada,[2] where he not only studied the technological state of the North American aluminum industry, but also made business contacts that were of great importance for his company in the 1930s and also during the rebuilding after the Second World War. 
The time between 1926 and 1929 was used to build a completely new plant in Teningen.

1918 First edition 
The Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man (German: Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen) was written by Thomas Mann from 1915 to 1918. 
Unlike his brother Heinrich Mann, he supported the war policy of the German Reich leadership in World War I. The book, which runs to almost 600 pages and is sometimes polemically formulated, served to justify and distinguish his political stance from that of his brother. 
It was taken up by representatives of the Conservative Revolution, especially the intellectual-historical observations in it, in which Thomas Mann attempted to counter the Western democratic ideas of his wartime opponents France and Great Britain with a German Sonderweg. 
To this end, Thomas Mann constructed an opposition between the concepts of civilisation and culture. 
In doing so, he professes "irrefutably" to the conspiracy theory according to which "the international Illuminati, the Masonic World Lodge" had not only mentally prepared the "war of 'civilisation' against Germany", but had actually unleashed it. In the following three very short chapters, The Protest, The Unliterary Land and The Civilisation Literate, he invokes Fyodor Dostoevsky. 
Like the latter, he describes Germany as the country that has always protested against the Roman Catholic, Western and literary world. 
Martin Luther, as Thomas Mann emphasises several times, gave this protest the "most powerful expression". 
As a non-literary country, Germany could only oppose Western civilisation with its stubborn, special will, because it had no word, it was not "word-loving and word-believing". 
In accordance with his thesis: "In Germany's soul, the spiritual antagonisms of Europe are fought out", it is the goal of the civilisation literate to assert the ideals of democracy and western civilisation against Germany's inner nature. 
Thomas Mann explains the significance of the "triumvirate" of Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche in the chapter Einkehr and shows their influence on his previous work. 
He interprets their statements, some of which contradict each other, in a "general revision" according to the new conditions in his sense. 
In doing so, he builds Nietzsche into his current friend-enemy scheme as follows: "The tremendous masculinity of his soul, his anti-feminism, anti-democratism, - what would be more German? 
What would be more German than his contempt for "modern ideas", for the "ideas of the eighteenth century", for the "French ideas" whose English origin he insists on: the French, he says, were only their monkeys, actors, soldiers..." 
In the chapter on bourgeoisie, Thomas Mann tries to link artistry and bourgeoisie. 
Another theme of this chapter is bourgeoisie and politics. 
He himself, like the German bourgeois, is apolitical and national. 
He refers to a monarchist speech Richard Wagner gave in Dresden in 1848, "in which he professed to be an ardent supporter of royalty, a despiser of all constitutionalism, and implored Germany to send the "foreign, un-German concepts", namely Western democratism, packing and to restore the only salutary old Germanic relationship between the absolute king and the free people: for ... the people are free only when one rules, not when many rule." He approvingly quotes a justification for monarchy from Arthur Schopenhauer: since the vast majority of the people are "highly egoistic, unjust, ruthless, mendacious, sometimes even mischievous, and at the same time endowed with very poor intelligence", they need a monarch above them who is above the law. 
The chapter Against Law and Truth is a reckoning with his brother Heinrich Mann and Romain Rolland, both of whom were on the side of the pacifists from the beginning of the war. 
Against them, Thomas Mann defends his war essays at length and very polemically. 
The chapter on politics is by far the longest. 
First, he defines politics as the opposite of aestheticism and cites Friedrich Schiller, Gustave Flaubert, Schopenhauer, Leo Tolstoy and August Strindberg as examples of aesthetes. 
Aestheticism means that "everything merely said is conditional and open to attack, however absolute and apodictic it is felt to be at the moment" and that "the spiritual, the intellectual is never taken entirely seriously". 
Nevertheless, he sees democracy asserting itself all over the world, including in Germany. 
He agrees with Friedrich Nietzsche that Otto von Bismarck's unification of Germany has politicised and nationalised Germany. 
He rejects a further democratisation of the state constitution on the basis of the sacrifices made by the people in the war. 
Interspersed with this is an intemperate polemic against Sigmund Freud's psychology: "But psychology is the cheapest and meanest thing. 
There is nothing earthly in which earthly dirt cannot be discovered and isolated by 'psychological analysis' ... 
Tell me what use psychology has ever been on earth! 
Has it been of use to art? 
Of life? 
The "dignity of man"? 
Never. 
It can only be useful to hatred..." 
In the chapter Von der Tugend (On Virtue), Mann opposes the "conceited" use of buzzwords such as freedom, justice or truth, which the civilisation literati consider to be solely virtuous. 
Under the heading Some things about humanity, Thomas Mann praises suffering, humility, service and obedience. 
For him, humanity means the knowledge of man's "weakness, helplessness and wretchedness", whereas the politician tries to "deprive life of all seriousness, all dignity, all gravity and responsibility" when, for example, he opposes the death penalty. 
He praises war as the "ennoblement" and "refinement" of man in the face of death. 
In the section On Faith, he presents another contrast: the faith of the civilisation literate against the doubt of the bourgeois. 
The bourgeois age began with doubt about the authoritarian Christian Middle Ages. 
True faith is not faith in any principles, words and ideas such as freedom, equality, democracy, civilisation and progress, but faith in God, i.e. faith in love, life and art. 
The chapter Aestheticist Politics expands on the contrast between the politician and the aesthete already discussed under Politics. 
He also calls the political artist an aesthete, because this is artistry, albeit a false one, "half, intellectual, intentional and artificial". 
Such an artist demands that art must have political consequences, but this is only a means to his success. 
Basically, the political artist also knows that opinions are not valid in the artistic sphere, so in case of doubt he withdraws with his politics behind the art. 
Finally, in the last chapter, Irony and Radicalism, Thomas Mann defends his own work, which is characterised by irony, against the sentimental and intellectual art of the civilisation literati. 
The ideas of aesthetics developed here remain valid for Thomas Mann's entire oeuvre, even after he had overcome the polemical glorification of war. 
Publication background 
The "conservative revolution" 
The reflections of an apolitical man can be assigned to an intellectual-historical current called the Conservative Revolution. 
After the defeat in the First World War and the collapse of the monarchy, many intellectuals had in common the idea that only through something revolutionary new could the old conservative ideals, which often stemmed from Romanticism and its resistance to the French Revolution, be preserved. 
They were united in their rejection of the Weimar Republic. 
Thomas Mann was also one of the supporters of this "conservative revolution" until his speech Von deutscher Republik. 
He was even one of the first to use this formula, as well as the term "third Reich" (already at the end of 1912 in the essay Zu Fiorenza). 
In the Reflections, he speaks of the future people's state that must be realised, which stands beyond Western democracy and the capitalism associated with it, and beyond socialism as it was about to develop in Russia. 
In his reflections, he wants to prove Germany's special position between East and West, which is why there are several references to the "German centre". 
he circle of the conservative revolution, the reflections continued to have an impact - even if only marginally. 
Criticism 
Publication history 
His brother Heinrich Mann reacted to this with an essay on Émile Zola, which appeared in René Schickele's pacifist journal Die Weißen Blätter in autumn 1915. This essay contained aggressive side-swipes at the unnamed brother as well as the central statement: "Spirit is deed done for man; - and so let the politician be spirit, and the spiritual man act!" 
Thomas Mann then interrupted his work on the novel The Magic Mountain. 
From October 1915 onwards, he wrote the Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man, in which he repeatedly referred to "the civilisation literate" (Zivilisationsliteraten) as a hostile figure – the older brother, whose name was not mentioned. 
The first three chapters, still short, were written by January 1916. 
In the Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man Thomas Mann posed considerations "that combine a revision of my personal foundations with all kinds of current events, things critical of the times, in a rather daring way". 
This "amalgamation" runs through the entire work. 
Comments on current politics remain rare and only attempt to reject the attacks and accusations of the "civilisation literate" (Heinrich Mann) from his basic patriotic stance. 
Questions of daily politics on which he comments are: A reform of the Prussian three-class franchise, which he rejects although believes is inevitable, or the invasion of Belgium by German troops, which he defends as well as the sinking of the RMS Lusitania and unrestricted submarine warfare. 
A central aspect of the work is the attempt to explain the German Sonderweg in terms of intellectual history and history and to establish a "Germanness" that is incompatible with the democratic principles of France, England and the US. 
The fact that Thomas Mann's perception of political and historical reality is predominantly shaped by literature is also evident in his ability to find justifications for his ideas in literature and to cite them to support his theses. 
Mann sees himself confirmed above all by the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, alongside Fyodor Dostoevsky and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
Other authors who are often quoted are Richard Wagner and Arthur Schopenhauer, also the nationalist and anti-Semitic authors Julius Langbehn and Paul de Lagarde, who were widely read and respected in the German Empire, and from Russian literature Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev. 
Content 
The first chapter, called the "Preface" and, according to its genesis, the last, is a reflection on the work written in three years. 
Thomas Mann gives the main reason why he wrote the huge work: "The insight from which it grew, which made its production seem inevitable, was above all that any work would otherwise have been intellectually overburdened". 
This refers to The Magic Mountain. 
The theme of the following chapters of the book is briefly explained. 
Thomas Mann recognises that, contrary to his intention and the title, he nevertheless wrote a very political book. 
He formulates the fundamental intellectual conflict he wants to deal with, which he considers to be the cause of the World War, as follows: 
„Der Unterschied von Geist und Politik enthält den von Kultur und Zivilisation, von Seele und Gesellschaft, von Freiheit und Stimmrecht, von Kunst und Literatur; und Deutschtum, das ist Kultur, Seele, Freiheit, Kunst und nicht Zivilisation, Gesellschaft, Stimmrecht, Literatur.“[1]

Paris" (in French). 
Sophie Jung grew in an artistic family in Basel. 
Both her parents and sister are actors and her grandmother is also an artist.[1] As a child she would accompany her parents to rehearsals and was fascinated by the world of theater. 
Her favorite part was watching behind the scenes as the costumed actors got into character just before they went on stage.[2] Initially Sophie Jung wanted to be an actress as well, but ultimately decided against it. 
She began studying German and English literature, changed to art history and then wanted to become a primary teacher. 
Afterwards she began photography at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen, but non of these satisfied her.[1] She ended up studying fine arts at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam and did her masters at the Goldsmiths University in London.[3] Subsequently, she realized exhibitions and performance projects in Switzerland, England and the USA. 
Sophie Jung's multi-media artistic practice focuses on performance, object and language – often with installations, repetition, references and ambiguous meanings. 
In her performances she deals with philosophical and current societal themes and questions definitive stories with ephemeral and polyphonic narrations.[1][2]

Federal securities are the securities issued by the Federal Government and its special funds, also referred to as public bonds or government bonds issued by the Federal Government. 
General 
Runtime 
Trend effects of the term on the yield 
The maturity of German Government securities varies from short-term (non-interest-bearing treasury note or Federal Treasury note) to long-term (Federal Bonds). 
Since new German Government securities are constantly being issued and the maturities of previously issued securities are continuously decreasing, around 60 different German Government securities with maturities ranging from a few months to 30 years can be traded on a permanent basis.[1] 
Emission method 
German Government securities are also divided into one-off issues and tap issues according to their issuing procedure. 
Until the discontinuation of business with private investors at the end of 2012, Federal Treasury bills, financing treasury bills and overnight bonds were issued as tap issues. 
They could be acquired on a permanent basis by investors, whose demand determined the scope or volume of an issue. 
The German Government securities that can still be purchased today are all issued as one-off issues. 
Federal bonds, Federal notes, Federal Treasury notes, non-interest-bearing Federal Treasury notes and inflation-indexed Federal securities are only offered for purchase at specific times. 
The targeted issue volume is determined by the issuer in advance. 
The issuance takes place in an auction in which registered banks of the "Bidder Group for Federal Issues" can participate. 
These then resell the majority of the bonds to other investors.[1] Due to the federal government's increased borrowing needs and thus issuance volume to address the COVID-19 pandemic, several issues will be conducted in the bank syndicate in 2020. 
Stock exchange trading 
With the exception of Treasury discount paper and tap issues, all German Government securities are traded on the German stock exchanges and on electronic trading platforms. 
Private investors can buy or sell them on each trading day via their bank. 
Market management for German Government securities operates the Deutsche Bundesbank by ensuring that trading takes place at fair prices.[1] The Finance Agency also participates in trading in German Government securities by supporting the Bundesbank as well as other market makers on electronic trading platforms and in OTC (over the counter) trading in German Government securities.[2] 
Technically, German Government securities become tradable as uncertificated securities through entry in the Federal Debt Register, whereby the Investor receives a co-ownership share in the securities portfolio in accordance with § 6 Abs. 
1 of the German Securities Deposit Act (DepG). 
Security 
The Federal Republic of Germany is considered one of the world's most secure debtors. 
The securities issued by the Federal Government are secured by German tax revenues. 
Germany is regularly awarded the highest possible credit rating of AAA by international rating agencies. 
In addition, investments in German Government securities are gilt-edged within the meaning of Section 1807 of the German Civil Code. 
They are used to finance deficits in the federal budget or specific projects and are managed by the Federal Republic of Germany - Finance Agency GmbH. 
As debt manager, the Finance Agency provides all services related to the issuance of the German Government securities with technical support from the Deutsche Bundesbank.[1] 
Use of the credits 
In addition to the federal budget, the loans taken out through federal securities benefit the following special federal funds of the federal government on a pro rata basis:[1] 
Financial Market Stabilization Fund (has its own borrowing authority) Investment and Redemption Fund (has its own borrowing authority) Economic Stabilization Fund (has its own borrowing authority)[1] Restructuring Fund for Credit Institutions (has its own borrowing authority) Provision for final payments on inflation-indexed federal securities Energy and Climate Fund Development aid fund Municipal investment support fund Childcare expansion and childcare financing Digital infrastructure

Types of German Government Securities 
The Federal Republic issues the following securities through the Finance Agency:[1][2] 
The issuance of the following (retail) securities was discontinued as of December 31, 2012:[1] 
Federal treasury bonds (Bonds with rising graduated interest rates) Type A (term 6 years - interest paid annually in arrears) Type B (term 7 years - interest accumulated (compound interest effect) and paid out at the end of the term). Financing treasures with 1 or 2 years maturity Overnight bond (unlimited term, similar to an overnight deposit account in the form of an accumulating federal bond) 
In 2019, the last two remaining private investor securities, the "Bundesschatzbrief" and the "Tagesanleihe", were redeemed. 
The first Green Federal Bond was launched on the primary market, on September 2, 2020, an earmarked bond for projects in transport, international cooperation, research, innovation and information, energy, industry, and agriculture and forestry. 
Despite a negative yield the bond, which was launched with a trading volume 6.5 billion euros, was five times oversubscribed.[1] 
Karl-Josef 'Kajo' Wasserhövel (* 17 August 1962 in Aachen) is a German politician (SPD), and cofounder and managing partner of Elephantlogic strategy consulting agency. 
Wasserhövel won ‘Best campaign manager of the year: 2005 Politics Award’, for his role in reducing the 21% lead the CDU held over the SPD at the beginning of the election campaign down to 1% by the end of the campaign. 
Political observers have called him the ‘the SPD’s spin doctor’ for years. 
However, in October 2005, SPD party leader Müntefering's announcement that he would propose Wasserhövel as the party's future Secretary General triggered opposition within the party's left-wing factions, which preferred Andrea Nahles, a member of the Bundestag, for the position. 
The objection raised against Wasserhövel was that, although he had gained considerable merit as a successful election campaign organizer, he was too ‘apolitical’ to follow the party agenda as Secretary General and was defeated in the preliminary decision in the party executive committee. 
As a result, his supporter Franz Müntefering declared that he would no longer run for Federal Chairman. 
Wasserhövel succeeded Müntefering as Permanent State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Labor in November 2005. 
On September 15, 2008, Wasserhövel again became Federal Chairman. 
Wasserhövel stood as a direct candidate in the Berlin constituency of Treptow-Köpenick in the 2009 federal election. 
However, he failed to enter the Bundestag.[3] On November 15, 2009, Wasserhövel handed over the office of SPD Federal Chair to his successor, Astrid Klug.[4] 
In April 2010, Wasserhövel cofounded the strategy consultancy agency: Elephantlogic.[5] together with long-term associate Svenja Hinrichs. 
Hinrichs had worked together with Wasserhövel in varying roles since 1998. 
Elephantlogic provides services for NGO, business and political clients. 
The agency is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. 
In 2016 Wasserhövel cofounded the association ‘Artikel 1 - Initiative für Menschenwürde e.V.[6]’. 
Named after the 1st article in the German Basic Law (constitution) covering human dignity and human rights, the aim of the association is to promote communication on democracy and human dignity. 
Wasserhövel is its cochair.

Education 
After attending primary school in Kamp-Lintfort and Bocholt and the St. Georg Highschool in Bocholt, Wasserhövel passed his university entrance qualifications in 1983. 
Political and professional career 
Kajo Wasserhövel has been a member of the SPD since 1978. 
In the early 1980s, he became involved in peace initiatives and in the Bocholt chapter of Amnesty International. 
From 1987 to 1989, as a representative of the Marxist Freudenberg Circle, he was a member of the federal executive committee of the SPD young socialist ‘Juso’ university groups. 
In 1988/89, he was the university policy advisor for the Juso university group in the General Students Committee of the University of Münster. 
From 1991 to 1995, Wasserhövel headed the Juso secretariat of the Westphalia district as a full-time youth education officer. 
Since the mid-1990s, he has been one of the politician’s, Franz Müntefering, closest associates, accompanying him throughout his political career. 
In 1995, as Müntefering was the North Rhine-Westphalian ministerial office for labor, health and social affairs in Düsseldorf, he was his speechwriter. 
From 1995 to 1998, he continued working for Müntefering, then the Federal Secretary of the SPD, as his personal assistant in Bonn. 
From 1998 to 1999, as Müntefering became Minister of Construction and Transport, Wasserhövel headed his office. 
After Müntefering was elected SPD Secretary General in October 1999, Wasserhövel was his office manager, as well as head of the executive secretariat at the SPD party executive in Berlin until September 2002. 
And In October 2002, when Müntefering became parliamentary party leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Wasserhövel continued to organize his office. 
He also served as head of the SPD parliamentary planning group. 
On March 22, 2004, he was appointed Federal Executive Director of the SPD at the suggestion of his longtime mentor. "A quiet organizer of power," Bettina Vestring wrote in the newspaper ‘Berliner Zeitung’ about a portrait of Wasserhövel, describing his understated demeanor: 
"He likes to stand far back in the hall. 
Quietly and inconspicuously, in a discreet dark gray suit, he listens to the party conference speeches. 
Only those who know him approach him, exchange a few quiet words, then make way for the next person. 
Kajo Wasserhövel, the future federal director of the SPD, does not care for public attention. ‘He is very precise, very discreet and very down-to-earth,’ one comrade describes him. 'Above all, he is Müntefering's right-hand man.'"[1] 
For years, Wasserhövel has belonged to Franz Müntefering as much as his white pack of cigarillos. 
From a briefcase carrier, Wasserhövel has become a coordinator of a snap election."[2] 
We Are Church (WAC) is the international arm of the local reform group which originated in German-speaking Austria, Germany and South Tyrol in 1995 under the title Wir sind Kirche and was organized as an association in 1996.[1] WAC advocates changing the teachings and the structures of responsibility and authority of the Catholic Church. 
The Violinzither or Violinharp is a string instrument of the zither family, invented in 1925 by Clemens Neuber in Klingenthal.[1] The instrument is a cross between the fretless chord zitherand a concert zither. [2] 
The instrument noramlly has eighteen melodic strings, with five or six sets of strings serving as an accompaniment, which are plucked with the left hand. 
A violin bow (about 55cm long) held by the right hand is used to play the melodic strings.[1] A variant of the violin zither, the concert violin harp, was created by Max Lausmann. 
Many violin zithers were sold under the name "Kalliope" by the company C. A. Wunderlich.[2] Violinzithers have been manufactured luthier C. Robert Hopf since the 1920s.[3]

Kinsky was an acknowledged specialist of musical instruments and their history and had written the 1910-1916 catalogue of the museum.[3] Being the son of a Jewish businessman, Kinsky was persecuted by the Nazis, which lead to the forced termination of his career as an academic[4], and the forced possesion of his private library and collection. 
Kinsky then served a year in a labour camp until 1945, with the Allied Victory of World War Two. Kinsky spend the rest life from 1945 onwards compiling Das Werk Beethovens[5], a thematic index of all of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. 
Although Kinsky died before finishing the work, the unfinished volume was purchased by the Bavarian State Library[6], and was eventually completed by musicologist Hans Halm. 
Contrary to reports at the time, Kinsky's academic library was not destroyed, and instead came into the possession of the Bouvier bookshop in Cologne. Music publisher Peter J. Tonger later purchased the library for 35,000 Reichmarks, with the intention of making it available to Kinsky. 
However, this was on the basis that Kinsky move from Cologne to Berlin, which he refused to do.[7] After Kinsky's death in 1951, the library has remained in private ownership.

The Antonov An-325 was a planned enlarged and improved version of the Antonov An-225, but it was never built. 
Project 
This aircraft was to have two additional engines, which were to be mounted on the respective inner engine mounts in a manner comparable to the U.S. Boeing B-47. 
This would have resulted in an eight-engine aircraft with six engine nacelles. 
The plane, which never got beyond the planning stage, was intended as a launch platform for Russian and foreign spacecraft. 
The rockets were to be carried with it on their backs to high altitudes and launched from the aircraft into Earth orbit. 
It would have become by far the largest and most powerful aircraft in the world.

The Alexandrit effect describes the phenomenon of light-induced colour changes in certain minerals. 
The effect was named after thealexandrit mineral, but it is also used to refer to similar processes in other minerals. 
The effect is thought to be caused by a combination of specific light characteristics, the spectral absorption of the mineral, and the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. 
Further reading 
1978. p. 221. {{cite book}}: Check |url= value (help) 
Alexandrit appears emerald green in daylight and red in the light emitted by candles and some lightbulbs. 
The primary structural mechanism involved is the presence of two spectral zones with low absorption and at least one spectral zone affecting intermediary wavelengths with high absorption. 
The effect is caused by transition metal atoms dispersed in the mineral. 
In the case of Alexandrit, this is usually Chromium that is incorporated during the crystallization process through coupled substitution, but other elements such as Vanadium, Manganese, and Iron can also be involved.[1] 
The incorporated transition metal atoms respond to certain wavelengths of light, which changes the perceived colour. 
For example, they don't respond to fluorescent lights, as the light they emit is similar to daylight. 
The atoms respond to warmer lights such as those emitted by candles, producing colour changes. 
In determining the apparent colour of a mineral when exposed to a specific light, the characteristics of the human eye are an additional relevant consideration. 
In general, the human eye is most sensitive to green wavelengths. 
The Alexandrit effect has also been observed in some other minerals. such as Fluorite, Sapphire, Kyanite, Monazite, Spinel, Garnet, Tourmaline, and rare-earth oxalates. 
Not to be confused with the Alexandrit effect, some minerals also exhibit Pleochroism. 
The former is a reponse to different wavelengths of light in general, the latter an optical artifact of crystalline structures.

In the 17th century Rawitsch became a place of refuge for Protestants and other oppesed faiths from Bohemia and Silesia who fled from Habsburg oppression. Later sons of the family were given the name "Sigismund" in memory of a prince who had protected Protestants at that time, possibly the king of Poland Sigismund II. 
August and the Elector of Brandenburg Johann Sigismund. 
Also significant is the Protestant theologian and scholar Sigismund Gottlieb Schroeter (1694-1760), grandson of Heinrich Schroeter. 
Sigismund Gottlieb was pastor in the Church of Peace in Jawor, one of the most important churches in Silesia, today part of the UNESCO World Heritage. Until a burglary in 1962, an painting of "Archidiaconus Schroeter" had hung in the vestry of the Church for 250 years. 
The first noble line is decendant of Heinrich von Schroeter, who was elevated to the Prussian nobility by Emperor Wilhelm II on January 18, 1901. 
Thomas Bayrle, in the film The Future of Art (2010) 
Thomas Bayrle (born November 7, 1937 in Berlin) is a German sculptor, painter, graphic artist and video artist. 
Bayrle's works are usually based on a basic graphic form. 
Starting with traditional techniques, he was among the first German artists to produce computer-generated and animated art. 
The essential visual element of his work is the principle of the serial. 
Bayrle finds himself in the American tradition of Andy Warhol or Roy Lichtenstein, but also of the German artist Sigmar Polke, in that he often uses images from the world of consumer goods. 
By reflecting on a world of goods as an accumulation of multipliable, repeatable forms and pictograms, Bayrle not only provides a commentary on society, but also refers to his own artistic means. 
The motors that were shown at dOCUMENTA (13) were assembled by the precision mechanics workshop Anton Schwinghammers. 
Bayrle's Pietà window in Eberbach Abbey, which was inaugurated at the end of 2020, was made from Taunus stone by the Derix glass studio. 
It depicts the mourning Mary with the body of Jesus. 
The overall picture is made up of many small smartphones. 
Exhibitions 
Bayrle has had solo exhibitions in Düsseldorf, Montreal, Cologne, Graz, Frankfurt am Main, Vienna, Venice, Auckland, Berlin, Duisburg, Geneva, Karlsruhe, New York, Zurich and Austin/Texas. 
Bayrle's works are represented in museums, public and private collections. 
In 1984 he took part in From Here - Two Months of New German Art in Düsseldorf. 
In 2002 he had an exhibition at the Städel Museum in Frankfurt am Main. 
In 2005 and 2006, Bayrle took part in exhibitions at the Center for Art and Media Technology, Karlsruhe, the Kunstmuseum Thun, the Kunsthaus Zürich, the Museum für Moderne Kunst (MMK), Frankfurt am Main, and the Kunsthalle Fridericianum, Kassel. 
In 2007 Bayrle exhibited at the Fonds Régional d'Art Contemporain Limousin (FRAC), Limoges and at the Office for Contemporary Art, Oslo. 
In 2008 he was a participant in the Biennale of Sydney (Art Gallery of New South Wales). 
In 2009 a major retrospective exhibition was held at the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA) in Barcelona. 
In 2012 he took part in the dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel. 
Bayrle documented his examination of the Christian faith in 2014 with a selection of his works in the exhibition catholic in the Kunst-Station Sankt Peter Cologne and in the exhibition Agnus Dei in the St. Matthäus-Kirche at the Kulturforum Berlin. 
In his solo exhibition 'If something is too long - make it longer' at the Vienna Museum of Applied Arts (MAK), Bayrle combined traditional manual techniques with computer-generated art of the information age for the 2017/18 season. 
Significant new productions were also created for the exhibition, including the installation iPhone meets Japan, a walk-in scene with which Bayrle reflected a Japanese Shunga from the MAK’s Asia collection in a “super form” made of iPhones. 
Since March 2018, the Municipal Gallery in the Lenbachhaus and Kunstbau in Munich has been showing some of the artist's futuristic compositions. As part of the exhibition I'm a Believer. 
Pop Art and contemporary art from the Lenbachhaus and the KiCo Foundation will present the large-format sculpture "Autostrada" (2003) and other graphic wall panels from the collection.

Press 
Thomas Bayrle is the son of the painter and graphic artist Alf Bayrle and the art historian Elisabeth Weiss. 
From 1934 to 1937 Bayrle's parents worked at the Frobenius Institute and travelled in Africa. 
In 1940 Bayrle was evacuated with his mother and two younger brothers to Oberndorf near Gelnhausen in Hesse. 
In 1953 the family moved to Frankfurt. 
Bayrle wanted to become a textile engineer, and completed a two-year apprenticeship as a pattern designer and weaver in1956. 
At Gutmann's machine weaving mill in Göppingen, he worked on jacquard looms, the noise of which reminded him of a rhythmic sound that inspired him to work decades later, as did the vertical textile ornamentation. 
From 1958 to 1961 Bayrle studied at the Werkkunstschule Offenbach. 
Initially, he wanted to study commercial art, but he turned to printmaking and learned the technique of lithography and etching from Eberhard Behr. 
In 1961 he founded the Gulliver Press together with Bernhard Jäger and made a name for himself as a printer and publisher of artists' books. 
Among other things, one of the first books by Ernst Jandl (Hosi-Anna! 1965) appeared in the Gulliver Press – illustrated by Thomas Bayrle and Bernhard Jäger. 
From 1969 to 1972 Bayrle ran a creative studio with Hans Jörg Kellermann in Frankfurt's Westend, which produced three-dimensional objects as Bayrle & Kellermann - The Makers of Display, which oscillated between art and advertising, and also ran a screen printing workshop. 
Clients included the chocolate manufacturer Ferrero, the carpet brand Enkalon, the fashion designer Pierre Cardin and the trade union bank BfG. From 1972 Bayrle taught at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main. 
His students included Martin Liebscher, Marko Lehanka, Georg Peez, Manfred Stumpf, Kerstin Jeckel and Stefan Müller. 
In 1995 he held a visiting professorship at Tohoku University in Japan. 
In 2002 he retired.

A modern Bohemian Harp by Klangwerkstatt in Markt Wald. 
The Bohemian Harp (tschechisch harfa) is a Central European lever harp, similar to the Celtic harp, with a straight, tenoned neck. 
It was play foremostly by travelling musicians going through Europe in the 19th century, occasionally in bands.

The harp's pillar is mostly built of spruce. In original instruments, the soundboard uses a vertical wood grain, with some models using a herringbone pattern or diagonal grain (which was exceedingly rare). 
The instrument had sound holes in the top of the harp, as opposed to conventional harps, which have them in the back wall.[1] Strings were made of catgut, but modern replicas use either nylon or polyvinylidene fluoride. 
[2]The harp notably had a very small distance between the strings, and the strings were held under low tension, to reduce the weight of the instrument.[3] 
Bohemian harps come in two main varieties, those with levers to adjust the pitch of the strings, and those without. 
These hooks were used to change the pitch of a string by a semitone,[1] and were the forerunner of the semitone pedal on modernday pedal harps. 
Harps with semitone levers were often referred to as Hooked harps (German: Hakenharfen).[2]

The Revue des colonies[1] was a French journal published in Paris from 1834 to 1843 that campaigned for the abolition of slavery, particularly in the French colonies. 
It was under the leadership of Cyrille Bissette (1795 to 1858), the politician and founder of the Société d'hommes de couleur. 
The monthly journal gives a very complete overview of the state of the French and foreign colonies at that time. 
The Revue des colonies is the first French abolitionist journal written by black people, it was to become the bane of the French planters, especially those of Martinique, whom Bissette never forgave throughout the July Monarchy for branding him with a red-hot iron and expelling him during the Restoration, and whom he regularly hurled invective.[1][2] The first edition of July 1835 contains the bill formulated by the author for the immediate abolition of slavery.[3]

Amicus-Briefbund was the first homosexual publication in Germany after World War II. It was published in West Berlin from 1948 to 1953. 
In 1948, the former soldier Martin Knop received permission from the American occupation authorities in West Berlin to publish a magazine. 
The office was located at Nollendorfplatz. 
Amicus-Briefbund appeared monthly and consisted almost exclusively of personals and advertisements for events and venues aimed at same-sex loving men and women. 
The publisher's stated intention was to bring together those seeking "sincere comradeship" and "like-minded people" across "zonal and national boundaries," even if they did not want to "reveal themselves right away."[1] 
Personal ads came from all over Germany, although the majority came from Berlin, with the majority from West Berlin. Often, the ads simultaneously asked for the possibility of accommodation or work, or offered accommodation. 
In addition, the editor also encouraged placing ads for finding business partners and like-minded hobbies.[1] Advertisements for pubs or events, on the other hand, came exclusively from West Berlin, since the East Berlin pubs wanted to attract as little attention as possible because of conflicts with the Soviet occupation forces.[2] 
The Amicus-Briefbund documented the already shortly after the war again extensive homosexual life of the city for men and women alike. 
For example, ten balls were advertised for February 1950, and eight for March 1950. 
Further advertisements for venues such as the Kleist-Kasino also offered opportunities to go out in between.[1] 
Since other magazines for homosexuals appeared at the latest from the beginning of the 1950s, which offered editorial content in addition to advertising sections, the Amicus-Briefbund became increasingly superfluous. 
In 1953 it ceased publication.[1] 
Knop was active in the Berlin gay scene in other ways besides publishing Amicus-Briefbund. 
He was a member and on the board of the Berlin Gesellschaft für Reform des Sexualstrafrechts (Society for Reform of Sexual Penal Law). 
At the end of 1951, inspired by the Hamburg magazine Die Freunde, he founded a Klub der Freunde (Club of Friends) in the bar Die Hütte in Goethestrasse, which joined the Frankfurt-based Verein fur humanitäre Lebensgestaltung (Association for Humanitarian Living).[1] 
Richard Ogorkiewicz, born Ryszard Marian Ogórkiewicz, was a son of Polish Colonel Oberst Marian Ogórkiewicz (1898–1962). 
With the invasion of Germany his family fled first to Romania, then to France in February 1940.[1] In May they went to Scotland, where Richard attended school. 
Richard studied mechanical engineering at Imperial College London. 
After completing his studies, Ogorkiewicz continued to teach at Imperial. 
He then worked at Humber und Ford on gas turbine engines. 
In 1979 he became a lecturer, and from 1988 visiting professor at the Royal Military College of Science in Shrivenham. 
In 1993he became curator of the Tank Museum in Bovington[3]

Life and Work 
Siegelmarke der Leather factory, Hesselberger Brothers Munich 
Julius Hesselberger founded the company Gebrüder Hesselberger together with his brother Isidor in Biederstein, a district of Munich's Schwabing neighborhood, in 1869.[3] To the north of the site was Biederstein Castle. 
The object of the business was initially the trade in leather and leather goods, whereby the company was able to rely on an international network of agents who imported raw materials, initially from India, and later also from Asia, America and Africa. 
In addition to trading in leather goods, the Gebrüder Hesselberger company began tanning and producing leather goods itself in its own factory at Biederstein 7 in Munich (now Isarring 11) in 1889. 
Thus, the arrangement of the buildings followed the processing sequence, the factory itself had the latest leather processing machines, which were driven by a 260 hp steam engine from the MAN company. 
For the approximately 250 workers, there was a canteen, a workers' sick support association, baths and residential buildings. 
In addition to the tannery, the leather was processed on site.[4] In particular, a wide variety of leather and driving belts were manufactured, which transferred the water power of the neighboring Nymphenburg-Biedersteiner canal to the manufacturing machines of the J.A. Maffei locomotive and machine factory located in the immediate vicinity, as well as the Frey woolen goods factory (later Lodenfrey).[7] 
Franz Hesselberger was also a court-sworn expert for tanning and red tanning. He also sat on the supervisory board of the shoe factory Silberstein & Neumann AG in Schweinfurt and was a member of the admission board for securities at the Munich stock exchange. The company Gebrüder Hesselberger was also one of the founding members of the Munich and Upper Bavaria district association of the Federation of Industrialists. 
Franz Hesselberger had considerable real estate in Munich. 
In addition to the manufacturing site at Biederstein 7, there was a retail store of the company in the city center at the address Burgstraße 15. 
On January 7, 1918, he was appointed, like his father before him, a Kommerzienrat, an honor only bestowed on renowned and socially committed industrialists..[1] A number of donations and endowments are attested from the Hesselberger family, which enjoyed a good reputation among the Munich bourgeoisie for a long time. 
From 1864-66 he was a member of the Rigsråd. 
In 1890 he became the first real farmer to be knighted in the Order of the Dannebrog. 
He is buried in Møborg. 
A monument was erected to him in Lemvig in 1899. 
He is depicted with a bronze relief portrait on the gravestone from 1907 and on contemporary woodcuts, e.g. from 1877.

The premises of the First Kulmbacher Actienbrauerei around 1900 in downtown Kulmbach. 
In the background Kulmbach's landmark, the Plassenburg. 
The First Kulmbach Shares Brewery Inc. (1872-1996) in Kulmbach, was a public limited company and one of the most-famous breweries in Germany, mostly under their beer brand EKU, which is what it is called. 
The Structure 
Beer label with EKU awards 
The brewery was modernized in two construction phases. 
In the first phase from 1873 to 1875, the renovation of the former communal brewery building, the new construction of a cool warehouse and fermentation cellar building, a storage cellar building and a machine and boiler house, as well as the start of construction for a new malt house took place. 
The expansion of production capacities led to an ever-greater concentration in the inner-city area. 
With the exception of two residential buildings, EKU was able to acquire all the land in the district and build on it for the most part.[1] 
The development of the brewery up to the year 1900 is impressive. 
210 employees were employed. 
In Bavaria, EKU was one of the largest breweries. 
In Kulmbach, EKU had the highest beer output. 
The next largest brewery only reached half of this output. 
The beers have received numerous awards. 
So, with a gold medal in Leipzig 1905. 
This was a great success for Michael Taeffner, who died on May 14, 1900. 
Beginning of the 20th Century 
Share of the First Kulmbacher Actien-Exportbier-Brauerei, 1923 
Setbacks 
The almost unchecked boom at the end of the 19th century was followed by severe setbacks from 1900 onwards, which affected the entire Kulmbach brewing industry. 
Beer exports steadily declined and reached an all-time low in 1910. 
The reason for this was not just the economic situation, but a lawsuit that took place in 1899 and raised a lot of dust because the Kulmbach breweries were accused of violating the Bavarian Purity Law and adulterating food. 
The reason was the use of burnt starch sugar instead of malt to color the dark beer. 
Beginnings 
In the year 1906 EKU also produced bottled beer, after previously, beer had only been delivered in kegs. 
At short intervals, the other breweries in Kulmbach followed. 
In 1910, it came to other government requirements. 
The Bavarian State Ministry of the interior ruled that the distance of the fill line from top rim of the beer glass must be two to four centimeters. 
This was a success of the mutinous beer drinkers against poor pouring. 
World War I and Inflation 
The company survived World War I with production severely curtailed, down to a seventh of what it was during peacetime. 
The difficulties in the supply of raw materials continued even after the war years. 
In the 1922-23 financial year, for the first time in the company's existence, no dividends could be distributed to the shareholders. 
After the end of the First World War and inflation, EKU clearly held the top position in Kulmbach. 
With the purchase of a bottle cleaning and bottle planting, it assumed a pioneering role in the 1927-28 financial year. 
Up to this point, the beer was almost exclusively sold in barrels. 
Relocation 
In 1931 the brewery was relocated from Dresden to Kulmbach. 
Two years later, the board of directors announced the opening of new sales areas and even the export of beer to the US. 
World War II 
The Second World War had severe economic consequences for EKU. 
The difficulties in the supply of raw materials and war damage to the factory facilities led to high production losses. 
Necessary investments cannot be made. 
However, EKU was still able to produce to a limited extent but wrote considerable losses in the last two years of the war. 
Post-war Period 
In 1945, EKU became the “Authorized American Army Brewery.” 
The first post-war years were also marked by great difficulties. 
Due to the division of Germany, not only were the material assets in Thuringia and Saxony lost, but above all lost most of the old customers. 
Foundation 
Under the Board of Director Eribert Kattein 
The chairman of the board, Eribert Kattein, played a decisive role in the continued upswing, who took on this task from 1960 to 1981 and opened new markets for EKU. 
Kattein took the decisive step into the future in 1968-69 with the construction of the new brewery "on the green field.” 
In just 12 months, a plant was built in the Mittelau in Kulmbach, which the trade press described as a technical pioneering achievement for a brewery. 
The buildings in the city center were demolished. 
Lost Business Acquisitions and The Kulmbach Beer War 
In 1981 Sandlerbräu was sold in Kulmbach and in 1984 the Mönchshof brewery was up for sale. 
Through the mediation of the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank(Bavarian Mortgage and Exchange Bank), it was not EKU that came into play in both cases, but the Kulmbacher Reichelbräu. 
This led to the Kulmbach Beer War in 1984.In the beer town of Kulmbach, there was a so-called "Burgfrieden" among the four established breweries. 
He said that in the home region, you are not allowed to solicit customers from each other, nor are you allowed to undercut the respective list prices. 
Employees also should not be enticed away from each other. 
When Reichelbräu acquired Mönchshof on August 20, 1984, without EKU being given the opportunity to bid, EKU regarded the "Burgfrieden" or the truce as broken. 
Reischach was so angry that he instructed his field staff to poach inns that were sourced from Mönchshof beer for EKU. 
The board of Reichelbräu also reacted accordingly and tried to win over restaurants that buy EKU beer. 
The result was that the hosts who visited were offered discounts of between 10 and 40 Deutsche Mark per hectoliter of beer. 
In the end, none of the mentioned inns changed their beer suppliers.[1] 
Emergence to become a European-wide Beer Company 
In 1978, Dr. Carl Reischach took over as CEO and one year later Gebr. 
März AG acquired most of the shares in EKU. 
Together with the majority shareholder, Dr. Reischach wanted to create a beer group that would operate throughout Europe. 
In the following decade, EKU therefore acquired several breweries and beverage distribution companies: 
Introduced in 1886, the label of the beer brand, Sct. 
Petribräu of the First Kulmbacher Actienbrauerei 
Bad Windsheimer Mineral- and Heilquellen GmbH, Bad Windsheim 
Henninger Bräu AG, Frankfurt, with the Eichbaum-Brauereien AG, Mannheim, Frankenthaler Brauhaus AG, Frankenthal, 
Bavarian Beverage Sales, Unterföhring, 
The company was founded as the First Culmbacher Shares-Export Beer-Brewery Public Corporation on November 2, 1872, in Dresden by four local businessmen together with the mayor of Kulmbach, Karl Rosenkrantz. 
The headquarters of the company was based in Dresden, the production facility was located as a branch in Kulmbach. 
The company was listed on the Stock Exchange (organized market) in Dresden. 
Vereinsbrauerei Greiz GmbH, Greiz, Bavarian Beverage Sales, Riesa, Goldquell Getränkevertrieb, Bad Langensalza, EKU Biervertriebsgesellschaft, Roitzsch, Ursteinquelle, Riesa, 
EKU invested 5-10% of the capital in breweries in the South Seas and concluded licensing agreements. 
They were: 
St. Vincent Brewery Ltd., St. Vincent, Western Samoa Breweries Ltd., Apia, Westsamoa, and Solomon Breweries Ltd., Honiara, Salomon Islands. 
EKU also became active overseas: In the USA, the EKU of America Inc. was founded in Wilmington. 
The total volume of beverages sold in the affiliated group in 1996 was 6.2 million hectoliters. 
That corresponded to a turnover of 750 million DM, almost ten times the turnover of the parent company EKU. 
The companies were purchased exclusively through bank loans. 
When the Reischach board took office in 1978 as chairman of the board, EKU's bank debts amounted to 12 million DM. 
EKU only survived when Gebr. März AG took over the profits. 
Despite the undesirable development, Reischach was elected chairman of the supervisory board in 1992. 
By this time, the extent of the casualties was already apparent.[1] 
They appointed Michael Taeffner from Kulmbach (1834–1900) as their board member. 
Taeffner was an experienced brewer who had already acquired the Communal Brewery II from the city of Kulmbach in 1869 with eight other shareholders. 
That brewery was located on Webergasse in Kulmbach, which at that time was still on the outskirts of the city. 
But as early as 1870, this brewery was too small to just cover the beer needs of its shareholders. 
Therefore they sold their brewery to the newly founded public limited company in Dresden. 
The Descent 
Since 1990, EKU once again started selling subsidiaries: 
When it came to investments, EKU completely overreached itself. 
The 50 million DM alone was invested in tangible investments for a new brewhouse, a logistics center and fermenting cellar. 
This enabled the capacity in the brewhouse to be increased to 1.2 million hL/year. 
The capacity of the fermenting cellar was even higher. 
In contrast, beer production in 1995 was only 0.85 million hL. 
A declining beer market also led to non-negligible sales losses at EKU. 
In Bavaria alone, beer sales fell by 5% in 1994. 
In contrast, the EKU has disproportionately lost sales. 
In the 1994-95 financial year, they had to cope with a drop in volume of 9%. 
In addition, there is a shift in sales towards cheap beers on the one hand and premium beers on the other. 
With its mid-price segment, EKU is among the losers. 
325 workers were employed. 
The Bankruptcy 
The trigger for EKU's bankruptcy proceedings was the claim for the opening of a court settlement proceedings by the parent company, Gebr. 
März AG, on March 8, 1996, at the Rosenheim District Court.[1][2] As a result, the obligations from the concluded profit and loss transfer agreement could no longer be met and the parent company can no longer compensate EKU's losses. 
März AG did not meet. 
As a result, EKU was insolvent and forced to file bankruptcy. 
On March 18, 1996, the Executive Board of EKU filed to the District Court of Bayreuth for bankruptcy proceedings to be opened. 
However, bankruptcy proceedings were not opened until April 30, 1996. 
To the bankruptcy administrator was the Stuttgart lawyer, Dr. Volker Grub, who was summoned.[1] 
Reichelbräu AG takes over EKU 
Failed Takeover Attempt 
Grub continued the takeover negotiations with the Kulmbacher Brewery AG, which the EKU board member, Jochen Weber, had already initiated in 1995. 
The loss of 30.3 million DM in 1995 had to be taken over by Gbr. März based on the profit and loss transfer agreement. 
März AG had then already made a down payment of 16.1 million DM. 
However, the final payment of 14.2 million DM was outstanding. 
It was to be settled in March 1996. 
Assuming that this payment would still be made, a sales agreement was concluded on February 14, 1996, between Gbr. 
März AG, represented by its CEO Dieter Jünemann, and Reichelbräu AG for all EKU shares. 
The purchase agreement failed because Gebr. 
März AG was unable to fulfill the obligation arising from the profit and loss transfer agreement due to its bankruptcy proceedings. 
Sale by the Liquidator 
The bankruptcy administrator Grub immediately started talks with Reichelbräu AG and offered to sell EKU's business activities as part of an asset deal. 
This meant that assets of the brewery, not the EKU shares, were only to be transferred. 
The latter would have required apologizing to the EKU, a process whose success would have been questionable and would have been prolonged for months. 
The board member of Reichelbräu AG, Gert Langer, feared that many customers would then end their contractual agreements with EKU and look for other beer suppliers if the negotiations were to drag on for a longer period. 
Until then, Reichelbräu was only known as a regional brand. 
The aim was to change their company name to Kulmbacher Brewery. 
Due to a historical agreement between the four major Kulmbacher breweries, Erste Kulmbacher, Actienbrauerei AG, Reichelbräu AG, Mönchhofsbräu GmbH, and Sandlerbräu GmbH, they had not been possible until now. 
The four breweries had agreed to not use the Kulmbach name by itself. 
After Reichelbräu had already taken over Mönchshofsbräu GmbH and Sandlerbräu, the acquisition of EKU gave Reichelbräu its first opportunity to create a "Kulmbacher Bier" brand. 
Studies had shown that Kulmbach is a well-known beer town in Germany, which should be valued higher than the individual brands from Kulmbach. 
Reichelbräu AG was therefore interested in concluding the contract quickly and was supported by its majority shareholder, Schörghuber-Holding-GmbH in Munich. 
As early as May 1, 1996, Grub concluded a sales agreement with Reichelbräu AG for EKU's operational assets, which also includes the minority shareholdings in the three overseas breweries. 
The purchase price was 68 million DM, and the delivery took place on April 1, 1996. 
EKU becomes E.K. Aktienbrauerei AG 
According to the sales agreement, Grub was obliged to change the company name Erste Kulmbacher Actienbrauerei AG. 
In the future, it will be E.K. Aktienbrauerei AG. 
Reichelbräu will then operate under the name of Kulmbacher Brauerei AG.[1] 
The shareholders planned to modernize and expand the brewery that had been taken over. 
They planned to export beer, not just brew beer for local needs. 
The company is thus the first brewery in the legal form of a stock corporation in Kulmbach and therefore bears the name First Culmbacher Shares-Export Beer-Brewery.[1] 
End of the Bankruptcy 
Grub ran the Greiz Brewery until July 30, 1997, and sold it to the entrepreneur Richard Wagner from Frankfurt. 
The bankruptcy proceedings were not fully completed until 2011, as the legal dispute was still being waged against EKU. 
EKU's bankruptcy creditors, with claims totaling 70 million DM, received a payment ratio of 51%. 
Five banks were secured with their loans amounting to 51.2 million DM with residential property charges and security charges which were then fully settled.[1] 
Early documents and newspaper articles on the First Kulmbacher Brewery in the historical press archives of the ZBW 
The founding of the stock corporation was a first step towards the industrialization of the brewery industry. 
In particular, the ice machine developed by Carl von Linde in the 1870s made it possible to cool the beer all year round and thus also to enable the transport of the beer.[1]

Scientific career 
Max Liebermann: Portrait of Mrs. Margarete Oppenheim, drawing, 1917, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam 
She was among the first personalities to collect works of modern art in Germany. 
The main focus was on works by Paul Cézanne. The collection was dissolved after her death, individual pieces can be found today in various museum ownership. 
The considerably larger remaining assets were to go to Franz Oppenheim's children from his first marriage, who were to make interest payments from this to the daughter Charlotte. 
The exact reasons for not bequeathing the entire estate to the biological daughter are not known. The author Sebastian Panwitz suspected that "a certain distance existed" in the relationship between mother and daughter. Margarete Oppenheim had also decreed that her art holdings were to be auctioned off, with the appropriate time to be determined by the heirs. 
An auction of the collection took place in the spring of 1936 at the Munich art dealer Julius Böhler. 
Both the daughter Charlotte and Franz Oppenheim's two children had already immigrated to Switzerland by this time. 
Since parts of the art collection had in the meantime been listed by the German Reich in the register of nationally valuable cultural assets, these works could not be taken abroad. 
The Oppenheim property that remained in Germany was later confiscated by the German authorities, and the villa on Wannsee served for a time as the Wannsee Institute of the Reich Security Main Office. 
Art Collection 
The exact extent and composition of Margarete Oppenheim's art collection can no longer be determined. 
These objects, acquired mainly during the marriage with Georg Reichenheim, mostly came from the Berlin and Munich art trade. 
Whether the couple selected these works together or whether one spouse alone made the decision to purchase them remains unclear in each individual case. 
What is certain, however, is that Margarete Oppenheim continued to pursue these areas of collecting even after the death of her first husband and occasionally added individual pieces to the collection. 
The catalog for the 1936 auction was prepared by renowned art historians from the Berlin Schlossmuseum, where the most valuable pieces of the collection from the fields of arts and crafts and sculpture had previously been on loan for about 15 years. 
The authors included Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Martin Klar, Erich Meyer, Ernst Günter Troche, Erich Köllmann, Theodor Falkenberg, Robert Schmidt, Leopold Reidemeister and Otto von Falke. 
They organized the collection according to their areas of expertise in different materials. 
The collection included small sculptures made of wood and ivory, among them were Christian sculptures such as a statuette of the Virgin Mary in the style of Tilman Riemenschneider. 
In addition, there was a group of bronze statuettes dating back to Roman and ancient Egyptian pieces. 
However, the collection also included Venetian Renaissance bronzes and northern Italian inkwells. 
The bronzeware section included mainly French Baroque clocks and wall and table chandeliers. 
The collection of silverware was also extensive, with objects coming mainly from Germany. 
This section included objects such as Renaissance and Baroque goblets, coin cups and lidded tankards. 
The collection also included a number of fancy goods and small utensils. 
These included tins and flasks, pin boxes, cane handles, pet shafts and signet rings, miniatures, jewelry, fans, plaques and medals, keys and eating utensils. 
Also represented in the collection were various historical textiles such as fabrics, embroidery and works made of lace. 
The Reichenheims had also acquired works of glass, majolica, and faience. 
Another part of the collection was European porcelain, for example from the manufactories in Meissen, Ludwigsburg and the Royal Porcelain Manufactory in Berlin. 
In addition, there were Chinese handicrafts such as glazed pottery, porcelains and objects made of stone, glass and metal. Most of the pieces are no longer traceable today and are possibly in private collections. 
Neben den Werken, die 1936 bei der Nachlassauktion in München angeboten wurden, waren andere Arbeiten im Verzeichnis national wertvollen Kulturgutes gelistet.[2] Hinzu kommen einige persönliche Überlieferungen von Zeitgenossen. 
Hierbei ließ sich die Sammlerin von dem Kunsthändler Paul Cassirer beraten, der sie zu den Käufen moderner Kunst erst „überreden“ musste.[3] Diese Ankäufe moderner Kunst setzte die Sammlerin nach der Hochzeit mit Franz Oppenheim kontinuierlich fort. 
Zu ihren letzten Erwerbungen gehörten einzelne Arbeiten des Expressionismus.[6] 
Den beiden Kunsthistorikern Anna-Carolin Augustin und Sebastian Panwitz gelang folgende Rekonstruktion der Sammlung von Margarete Oppenheim:[1] An älterer Kunst gab es von El Greco eine Darstellung der Madonna und eine Verkündigung (Verbleib jeweils unbekannt). 
Von Cézanne besaß die Sammlerin zudem das Aquarell Entlaubte Bäume (Verbleib unbekannt) und die aquarellierten Bleistiftzeichnungen La montagne Sainte-Victoire (Privatbesitz),[1] Waldinneres und Waldweg (Verbleib jeweils unbekannt). 
From the German-speaking world, Margarete Oppenheim acquired a painting version of Max Slevogt's Parrot Man from 1901 (private collection). 
Among her most recent acquisitions were the Expressionist paintings Toledo by Oskar Kokoschka from 1925 (Musée Jenisch, Fondation Oskar Kokoschka, Vevey) and Die Loge by Max Beckmann from 1928 (Staatsgalerie Stuttgart). 
Margarete Eisner was born in Leipzig in 1857, the daughter of Isidor Isaak Eisner and his wife Alwine (Lea), née Schlesinger. She was the second youngest of six children. 
Her father was a co-founder of the Leipzig company Callmann & Eisner, which traded in German and English manufactured goods. The family belonged to the wealthy Jewish bourgeoisie. Nothing is known about Margarete Eisner's youth and schooling. 
The family moved to Berlin in 1876. 
In the same year, Margarete Eisner married Georg Reichenheim, a chemist with a doctorate, whose family owned textile factories in Silesia. On the occasion of or shortly after the wedding, Margarete Reichenheim converted and embraced the evangelical Christian faith. The couple initially moved into an apartment in the house at Viktoriastraße No. 26 in Berlin's upscale Tiergarten district. 
In 1902 the daughter married the banker Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, from whom she divorced in 1927. 
She then married Georg Graf von Wesdehlen. 
The family circle also included the entrepreneur, art collector and patron James Simon, who had married Georg Reichenheim's sister Agnes in 1878. 
Die Familie Reichenheim verkaufte 1888 ihre Fabriken und konzentrierte sich auf die Management of the assets. Georg Reichenheim now devoted himself increasingly to building up an art collection. 
It is unclear to what extent his wife was involved in this. 
However, Margarete Reichenheim was certainly involved in the expansion of the collection, and she was partly responsible for correspondence with the museum director Wilhelm Bode, who was one of Reichenheim's advisors on art matters from 1890 at the latest. 
In a letter to Bode in 1892, Georg Reichenheim emphasized his wife's interest in art. Bode, in turn, attested to Georg Reichenheim as an "art lover with an unusual sense of quality and a pronounced preference for objets de vitrine." These objets de vitrine (objects for the display case) included handicrafts and small sculptures from various centuries. 
It is possible that the steadily growing collection was the reason for moving to a new apartment on the corner of Viktoriastraße and Margaretenstraße in 1890. 
Georg Reichenheim died in 1903. 
His estate, estimated at 4,700,000 marks, fell half to his daughter Charlotte and half to Margarete Reichenheim as his wife. 
After the death of her husband and now financially independent, Margarete Reichenheim continued to collect small sculptures and decorative arts, but from 1904 she also began to acquire modern paintings and works on paper. She bought such works of art at a time when these works still lacked widespread recognition. 
Historian Felix Gilbert noted in this regard that "they thought she was crazy in the family" to buy "so many of these awful modern paintings." It was not until the 1920s that this attitude changed and Margarete Reichenheim was admired for her courage. 
In 1906 Margarete Reichenheim married in second marriage the chemist Franz Oppenheim, who worked as general manager for the Agfa company..[1] Franz Oppenheim was also widowed; his two children, already grown up, were the chemist Kurt Oppenheim and Martha Oppenheim, who was married to the entrepreneur and later diplomat Ernst von Simson. 
After the wedding, Franz Oppenheim moved - unusually for the time - into his wife's apartment on Viktoriastrasse. 
For this purpose, three contiguous plots of land were purchased, on which the Oppenheim country house was built according to plans by the architect Alfred Messel. 
Another neighbor at Wannsee was the surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch, who also belonged to the circle of friends of the Oppenheims. 
It has been handed down from him that the Oppenheim country house was only inhabited in the summer and furniture trucks brought furniture, carpets and paintings from the town house to Wannsee in the spring and a corresponding return transport took place in the fall..[8] 
Margarete Oppenheim also appeared in public as an art-loving woman. 
Hans-Otto Spithaler (born 1937 in Westphalia) is a German banker and lawyer. 
In 1973, he moved from the banking business to the paper processing industry in Berlin. 
He became a board member of Kroch companies, including "AG für Haus- und Grundbesitz. 
For ten years he was significantly involved in the restitution of looted art of the property aryanized by the Kroch family[1] during the Nazi era, thus becoming an expert on the history of the Kroch group[2]. To this day, he is associated with the family in an advisory capacity and is involved in various Kroch companies as a member of the supervisory board. 
Hans-Otto Spithaler, who lives in Berlin, together with Rolf H. Weber, who is chairman of the supervisory board of the Kroch company "AG für Haus- und Grundbesitz", and the journalist Monika Zimmermann, have written a history of the Jewish family business Kroch in Leipzig, to which the Kroch high-rise building there goes back, from its foundation to its destruction under National Socialism. The dismantling of the Kroch concern continued under socialism in the GDR after National Socialism. 
With this book, Spitaler made a contribution to coming to terms with the injustices committed against the Kroch family by both National Socialism and the socialism of the GDR. 
The Kroch restitution case was not just any restitution case related to Aryanization, but one of the largest private restitution cases ever.

Mauthner was trained for the stage profession at the Vienna Conservatory. 
Her first station was the City Theater in Vienna (directed by Karl von Bukovics). 
She then went to Koblenz, Nuremberg and the Deutsches Theater in Budapest, where she met her husband Hans Förster, whom she married in April 1885. 
A permanent engagement from 1893 to 1895 at the Dresden Residenztheater followed. 
In 1897 she made a guest appearance at the Theater in der Josefstadt, was in Hamburg, and in 1899 joined the company of the Stadttheater in Brno. 
In the mid-1930s she was active at the Volkstheater in Vienna. 
The official cause of death was given as inflammation of the bowel.[2]

Im Staatlichen Textil- und Industriemuseum in Augsburg wird die Deportation Arnolds erwähnt.[1] 
Arnold became a member of the German Democratic Party in the Weimar Republic and was a deputy for it in the Augsburg City Council from 1920. 
He became co-owner of his father's cotton spinning and weaving mill Spinnerei und Weberei am Sparrenlech Kahn & Arnold, which had 940 employees in 1933 despite the world economic crisis. 
The company was Aryanized in 1938. 
In 1940 it was transferred to the Neue Augsburger Kattunfabrik (NAK). 
The Kahn and Arnold families received nothing for the factory. 
After the end of the Second World War, a questionable compensation came about.[1] 
The Kahn brothers, who were related to him by marriage, were able to emigrate with their family to London and Bombay respectively. 
Benno Arnold was deputy head of the Israelite religious community and board member of the Jewish old people's home. 
In 1941, he had to take over the board of the Augsburg Jewish community and help organize the evictions and deportations. 
Benno Arnold died there in March 1944. 
In 1928, Benno Arnold had acquired the spacious "Sieben Eichen" estate in Holzhausen am Ammersee. 
This served him and his wife Anna more and more as a retreat during the Nazi dictatorship. 
At the end of 1938, he had to sell the stately property to the municipality at a ridiculous price. 
The new owners were the Munich building contractor Fritz Schönmann and his wife Marion.[1].The couple were close confidants of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. 
After the collapse, the estate was returned to the surviving heirs. 
On January 27, 2022, Holocaust Remembrance Day, at the request of the "Jewish Museum Augsburg Swabia" Foundation in Holzhausen am Ammersee, "Seehholzstraße 1-3" was unnamed "Anna und Benno Arnold-Platz".

Memorials 
Matthias Hartmann in Deanery Office of the University of Applied Sciences Berlin 
As an expert for innovation and technology management, he worked as a business consultant. 
In his function as staff officer of the reserves, he was a consultant in Germany’s Federal Ministry of Defense. 
From 2018 to 2020, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of the HTW Berlin. 
In this function, he was responsible for supervising the university. 
Beyond that, since 2016, he headed the Digital Value Application Center,[3] which is supported by the European Fund for Regional Development and in which he fostered small and mid-sized companies from Berlin in their efforts to digitalize.[4] Especially such companies without research capacities of their own profit from the Center’s knowledge resources and interdisciplinary research teams, as Prof. Hartmann’s support project Digital Entrepreneurship shows.[5] What digitalization can mean for Berlin as a site for startups, for the people who live and work there, and for its visitors from all over the world was discussed at, for example, the event MittendrIn Berlin! (in the middle of Berlin).[6] 
His academic work was characterized by research guided by theory and strongly oriented toward practice and by system-theoretical influences like those of Niklas Luhmann and the epistemological and theory-of-science considerations of Karl Popper. 
In the studies under Werner Pfeiffer, Professor for Industrial and Retail Management, that shaped him, he consistently applied these ideas to business management issues like system rationalization and system economic efficiency, which ultimately provided the canon of his work in technology and innovation management. 
As a result, Matthias H. Hartmann worked out a form of technological accounting with which he earned his doctorate in 1996. 
In the following years, he published articles on technological accounting, company management, determining technological potential, and technological cost-analysis. 
He also wrote articles on the reporting systems of technological companies. 
He thereby answered questions on how financial control systems can be used for reporting systems, how new digital technologies can influence reporting systems, and how new digital technologies affect the company system.[7] His focus thereby was on the effect of technologies on the managing system or governance of companies. 
He published systems-theoretical articles on business models, IT security, and sustainability. 
Beyond that, he published empirical articles on the factors of success in the digital transformation of small and mid-sized companies.

Matthias H. Hartmann grew up in Berlin’s Wilmersdorf district. He attended college-prep high school in Bavaria: from 1975 to 1984 at the Dominicus von Linprun Gymnasium in Viechtach. 
In 1984, he became a reserve officer in Germany’s army, the Bundeswehr; trained as an individual fighter and pioneer paratrooper; later became a consultant for strategy and operations in the Federal Ministry of Defense; and finally, as Colonel of the Reserve, served until his death as Department Head of the Bundeswehr’s Operations Command in Potsdam. 
From 1986 to 1991, he studied Business Administration at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, majoring in Business Informatics, Industrial Management, and Accounting and graduated with a Diploma in Business Administration. 
As Business Manager at the Chair for Industrial Management of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg from 1992 to 1997, he was a doctoral candidate under Werner Pfeiffer, completing his doctorate with the title of Dr. rer. pol. 
Hartmann realized early that all successful activity requires both an adequate theoretical foundation and an understanding of practical implementation. 
This combination of theory and practice was the basis of his activity in all areas, whether academic instruction, company management, or the athletic challenges of volleyball, underwater rugby, skydiving, or triathlon, in which he repeatedly completed an Ironman. 
He displayed his particular way of thinking and acting especially as an officer of the Bundeswehr, most recently as a staff officer of pioneers with the rank of Colonel of the Reserve. 
Precisely implementing the principles of military leadership doctrine in combination with his practical experience as a leader of soldiers and with aspects of employee motivation and successful company strategies shaped his way of thinking and operating. 
Matthias H. Hartmann was married to Klára, née Némethy. 
The marriage produced two sons. 
Academic work 
Feldmann studied art in Munich and then went to Paris. 
There he was a student of Théophile Steinlen, among others. 
He became acquainted with the artists' circle of the Café du Dôme and August Macke. 
He appeared as an artist with drawings, etchings and watercolors as well as with designs for commercial graphics. 
At the beginning of 1912 he set up the Rheinischer Kunstsalon gallery in Cologne on Hansaring, followed by the Neue Galerie in Berlin at Lennéstrasse 6a at the end of 1913. 
After World War I, Feldmann married Ida Levy and settled with her and her daughter from her first marriage in Cologne-Deutz. 
In early 1939, the family left for Czechoslovakia. 
Feldmann himself, however, was arrested by German authorities in March 1939. 
In 1941 he was sent to the Theresienstadt ghetto, from where he was transported to Sobibór in 1942, where he met his death. 
His widow managed to emigrate to the USA in the same year. 
Galeries 
In 1912, Feldmann established the Rheinischer Kunstsalon gallery in Cologne, where he exhibited artists of today's Classical Modernism, such as Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Auguste Renoir, Braque, Derain and Pablo Picasso, as well as representatives of Italian Futurism. 
Among the German artists shown, in addition to Macke, other representatives of Rhenish Expressionism were in the gallery. 
Feldmann seems to have had contacts with the Parisian Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler through the German-Jewish gallery owner Alfred Flechtheim, who gave him works by Henri Matisse, Marie Laurencin, and Jules Pascin, among others, on commission for his branch at the Neue Galerie in Berlin. 
Feldmann's second Berlin exhibition at the end of 1913 was entirely devoted to Pablo Picasso and was entitled Picasso - Negro Sculpture. 
The catalog of the exhibition shows the image of the head a wooden statuette from the Ivory Coast, from the Baule people. 
The catalog mentions to the Berlin audience for the first time the connection of African sculpture with the new art of cubism.[1] 
openPetition gGmbH has been organized in steward-ownership since February 2022. 
As a steward-owned property, openPetition belongs to itself and cannot be sold or inherited. 
New managers or investors cannot make decisions that betray the company’s policy. 
Any profit the company makes, goes back to the company. 
If the position of managing director at openPetition opens up, his successor has to come from the company’s own ranks. 
openPetition supports the "Transparent Civil Society Initiative" launched by Transparency International Germany in June 2010. 
There are no legally standardised transparency obligations for non-profit organisations in Germany. However, openPetition made the voluntary commitment to follow the guidelines of the Transparent Civil Society Initiative by publishing an annual transparency report on company goals, the origin and use of funds as well as the internal decision-making processes.[6] 
Goals 
openPetition is committed to simplifying and further developing the tools of participatory democracy. 
The organisation’s goals are to advise and support people in creating, disseminating and submitting online petitions. 
In addition, openPetition educates people about the right to initiate petitions and to participate in political decision-making processes – among others through lectures, scientific cooperation and a data compilation project, called the petition atlas[8][9]. 
Furthermore, the platform aims to strengthen political participation: at municipal level through the "openDemocracy-Tool", at the national level through the so-called "House Parliament" platform published in 2020[10] as well as internationally through the creation of a common platform for all European and some non-European countries - upholding the guiding principle of political neutrality in all its endeavours. 
According to company sources, openPetition represents the largest dialogue platform in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) and is currently available in 27 languages.

Values and working methods 
According to the right to petition, anyone can submit his or her concern to the Petitions Committee in the form of a request, complaint or proposal. openPetition helps people to make use of this right whilst sticking to its principles as a politically neutral and transparent organisation. 
Signatures can be collected not only via the platform, but also through widgets embedded on other websites as well as through offline signatures on paper forms that can be uploaded to the website. openPetition is the only platform to have a quorum for regions in Germany as well as in Austria.[11] If a quorum, a regional relevance threshold, is reached through a certain amount of signatures, openPetition asks the responsible parliament of the respective region for a statement which is then published on the petition website. openPetition also guarantees the submission of petitions to the responsible petition committees.[12] Periodically openPetition publishes the so-called petition atlas that compares all petition committees of the German federal states and the federal government by taking into account the three categories “digitisation”, “citizen-approach” and “transparency”.[9] This way, openPetition contributes to a transparent dialogue between citizens and politicians. 
In the same year, openPetition introduced a new format “House Parliaments”, where interested parties can debate political issues in private discussion groups and then vote on them. 
Data protection 
Both the organisation and the servers of openPetition are based in Germany and are therefore subject to the Federal Data Protection Act, the Telemedia Act and the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
All data transmissions to the servers are encrypted with TLS.[13][1] 
openPetition is an online platform for petitions, free of charge and open to all. Registered as a non-profit limited company, openPetition supports people in starting petitions, generating public interest and submitting them to decision-makers in politics, business and society. openPetition’s overall aim is to promote democracy and citizen participation as well as to contribute to a transparent dialogue between citizens and politicians. 
Furthermore, the organisation advocates for a more effective petition law in Germany and Austria.[1] Since 2019, it has also been providing a free petition system at local level called the openDemokratie-Tool to interested municipalities.[2] [1]

In 2021, 3.410 petitions were published on the platform, supported by more than 5.9 million online signatures. 
The beginnings 
Jörg Mitzlaff, founder and creator of the platform openPetition, was already politically active in the democratic association Mehr Demokratie when he saw the need to create a more effective and digital tool for political participation. 
In 2009, he took a sabbatical in order to programme the petition platform alongside with other software developers. 
Until 2012, openPetition was run as a voluntary project. 
After openpetition.de went online in April 2010, Mitzlaff resumed full-time employment and maintained the petition site in his spare time.[7] In June 2012, Jörg Mitzlaff and the association Campact founded openPetition gemeinnützige GmbH in the legal form of a non-profit limited company, with Jörg Mitzlaff as managing director. 
Since 2020 openPetition has been financially independent of Campact e.V. Since February 2022 it has been organized in steward-ownership. openPetition gGmbH is based in “Werkstatt Digitale Demokratie” in Berlin.

Thea Bauer was the daughter of the wealthy screw manufacturer Georg Bauer, who left her a fortune of two million Reichsmarks after his death in 1906. 
She was raised Catholic and attended girls' boarding schools, including one in Brussels. 
While still a schoolgirl, she began a correspondence with Maurice Maeterlinck. 
In 1906 she left Arthur Löwenstein for good; the marriage was divorced in 1906, and Löwenstein was given custody and asset management of both daughters, although the second was Sternheim's child. 
In 1907 she married the art collector Carl Sternheim. 
In 1908 she and her family moved into the castle-like estate "Bellemaison" in Höllriegelskreuth near Munich, which she had designed herself and which was subsequently built by the architect Gustav von Cube. 
She became estranged from Sternheim because of his sexual infidelity, his delusions and the squandering of her fortune, and finally withdrew his administration: "I must get used to living with Karl without being his wife. [...] 
Since November I have been managing my assets alone. [...] 
If I had never placed unconditional trust in him, I would never have been exposed to the embarrassing feeling of being deceived at my expense.“[1] In 1927 she was divorced from Carl Sternheim. 
Before the beginning of World War I, she moved into La Hulpe Castle in Belgium with Sternheim, but returned to Germany again and again for temporary stays, primarily in Munich. 
She formed intense friendships with, among others, Frans Masereel, André Gide, Gottfried Benn, as well as with the Belgian painter Herman-Lucien de Cunsel (1908-1971), her lifelong friend for decades, and most recently in Basel with Peter Geiger. 
She translated various French-language works by André Maurois, among others, into German.[1][2] 
In France, she was briefly interned in the Camp de Gurs at the outbreak of war in 1939, but was able to escape in company with Alexandra Ramm-Pfemfert, among others. 
In Germany, her assets were frozen, and she eventually lived impoverished in a small apartment in Paris. 
In 1944, she was deprived of her German citizenship. 
After the end of the war, she remained in France. 
There she maintained contact for a time with the Berlin society photographer Frieda Riess, who had emigrated to Paris in the 1930s. 
Thea Sternheim received a reparation payment for her daughter's suffering in the Nazi concentration camp.

Franz Joseph Esser: Self-portrait with pipe, ink pen on drawing paper, ca. 1929 
In the years up to 1933, his close contacts with the Cologne Progressive group developed, where he became acquainted with Gerd Arntz, Hannes Maria Flach, Marta Hegemann, Heinrich Hoerle, Franz W. Seiwert and Luise Straus-Ernst. 
Study visits took him from Cologne to Istanbul and Paris between 1927 and 1929, where he presented his work in solo exhibitions. 
In 1928/29 the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in Cologne acquired several of Esser's works. 
In 1929 he participated in a double exhibition together with Adolf Schleicher at the Cologne Kunstsalon Dr. Becker & Newman. 
Between 1930 and 1933 he worked part-time as a press artist for the Kölnische Zeitung, writing and illustrating reports for the baths supplement "Die Reise". 
Although politically more left-wing, Esser joined the NSDAP because he saw no career opportunities for himself without this step.[3] 
Three of these were produced at the Franz Mayer'sche Hofkunstanstalt in Munich. 
In his denazification proceedings, he was banned from working as a caricaturist for three years by the Spruchkammer München-Land on May 11, 1948. 
However, from 1949 to 1964 he was again active as a cartoonist at the Nürnberger Nachrichten. 
Along the way, he again worked to a limited extent with abstract oil painting. 
From 1958, designs for book illustrations moved to the forefront of his work. 
Esser died at the age of 73 in Seefeld am Pilsensee and was buried in Gräfelfing. 
Work 
Between 1908 and 1964 Franz Esser was continuously active artistically as a painter or caricaturist. 
His works include watercolors, ink, pencil, colored pencil and charcoal drawings, lithographs, woodcuts, etchings, oil paintings, stained glass window designs (3 of which were executed), caricatures, and illustrations of travelogues and children's books.[1][2] 
The graphic collection of the Museum Ludwig in Cologne has six of Franz Joseph Esser's works, the Karikatür Müzesi (= Caricature Museum) in Istanbul holds two of his caricatures, and the city archive of Unkel has five of his printed works. 
All other works are privately owned. 
Family 
Exhibitions 
His wife's mother was the daughter of the Cologne history painter Michael Welter. 
Education In 1907, as a 16-year-old schoolboy, Esser began painting oil pictures. 
In 1910 he graduated from the Royal Kaiser Wilhelm Gymnasium in Cologne. 
He then studied art history at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Bonn with Paul Clemen, at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin and at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich with Heinrich Wölfflin until 1914. 
At the universities he also took drawing and modeling courses, where he met Max Ernst. 
In 1912 he went on a study trip to Constantinople. 
Following his studies, he was employed as a volunteer at the Bockhorni Royal Court Glass Painting Company in Munich. 
Wartime service 
At the beginning of the First World War in August 1914, Esser enlisted as a war volunteer. 
He was initially deployed to the Western Front on the Somme and in the Vosges, and later to the Eastern Front in Galicia and Romania, where he became a Russian prisoner of war in 1917. 
His subsequent odyssey through various camps in Siberia (Khabarovsk, Kansk) and a lengthy journey home through Manchuria can still be traced today on the basis of numerous sketches he made. 
He returned to Germany by sea via Vladivostok. 
Professional development 
After his return, in 1921/22, he initially sought connection to Berlin artistic circles and became a member of the "Kommune," which soon dissolved, and in whose 1st and 2nd Manifestos he participated together with Otto Freundlich and Raoul Hausmann. 
Between 1922 and 1925 he stayed with or near his parents in Unkel. 
From there he made several trips to Prague.

Karl Neumeyer was the younger brother of the judge and chairman of the Association of Bavarian and Jewish Communities Alfred Neumeyer. 
He attended the Maximiliansgymnasium and then studied law in Munich, Berlin and Geneva. 
In 1901 he habilitated at the University of Munich and became an associate professor in 1908. 
Among other things, he dealt with private international law and founded the legal field of international administrative law. 
In 1913 he declined a call to the University of Zurich. 
In 1926 he received the title of full professor, in 1929 also full professor. 
In 1931 he became dean of the faculty. 
After the transfer of power to the National Socialists in 1933, Neumeyer's work became increasingly difficult due to his Jewish origins. 
In 1934 he was forced into retirement and banned from teaching and publishing. 
In 1941, faced with imminent deportation and murder, he and his wife committed suicide. 
He is buried in the New Jewish Cemetery in Munich. 
Commemorations 
Memorial sign for victims of the Nazi regime in Munich for Karl and Anna Louise Neumeyer 
In Munich, several sites commemorate Karl Neumeyer: At Königinstraße 35a in Maxvorstadt, a memorial sign of the City of Munich commemorates him and his wife since July 2019. 
In 1962, Neumeyerstraße in Allach-Untermenzing was named after him. 
In 2008, the building of the Faculty of Law of the University of Munich at Veterinärstraße 5 was named Karl-Neumeyer-Haus.[1]In the building there was already since 1970 a Neumeyer hall and a memorial plaque.[2] 
The art collection of the Jewish entrepreneur Carl Sachs, (born 1868 in Jauer/Jawor; died 1943 in Basel), who lived with his wife Margarethe in a villa in what was then Kleinburgstraße in Breslau, included numerous paintings, watercolors and graphics before his death. 
In 1939 he emigrated to Switzerland with his wife. 
Works by French and German artists were represented. 
Among the French artists were Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, Eugène Delacroix, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley, while among the German artists in the collection, apart from Wroclaw painters, there were mainly Wilhelm Leibl, Wilhelm Trübner, Fritz von Uhde and the main representatives of German Impressionism Lovis Corinth, Max Slevogt and Max Liebermann. 
There were also paintings by Hans Purrmann, who was close to Matisse. 
Furthermore, in his collection there were Dutch paintings of the 17th century, such as a picture by David Teniers the Younger. 
Sachs also owned a collection of prints and drawings with works by James McNeill Whistler, Edvard Munch, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Francisco de Goya, Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Pablo Picasso and Honoré Daumier. 
Sculptures by German and French artists were also part of his collection, including works by Georg Kolbe and Aristide Maillol. 
NAK Stoffe AG, formerly Neue Augsburger Kattunfabrik (NAK for short), was a German fabric printing company based at Vogeltor in Augsburg. 
It existed from 1702 to 1996 under various shareholders and company names. 
The company's shares were listed on the Munich Stock Exchange. 
The factory printed fabrics made of tree and rayon, artificial silk and synthetics for clothes of all kinds and exported them to all continents. 
The company remained in the hands of the Apfel family for two more generations. 
In 1757, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. 
The company had debts amounting to 36,000 gulden. 
Johann Michael Schöppler took his brother-in-law Gottfried Hartmann from Nuremberg into the company as a partner and continued to run it under the name Schöppler & Hartmann. 
During these years, Augsburg calico printing experienced its heyday. 
The heyday ended in 1791 with the French Revolution. 
Sales declined and the company suffered heavy losses. 
The number of employees fell to 200. 
Schöppler withdrew from the management of the company and was replaced by another brother-in-law, Georg Paul Forster.[1]With the Continental Blockade imposed by Napoleon in 1806, a ban on imports of goods from England and its colonies, business picked up noticeably.[2] 
Carl Forster shaped and developed the company to a particular extent. 
New finishing methods made production cheaper and faster. 
The company's fabrics achieved world fame. 
He co-initiated the founding of the German Customs Association on March 22, 1833. 
In 1837, he co-founded the Mechanische Baumwollspinnerei und -weberei AG in Augsburg. 
Its purpose was to cover the company's raw material requirements. 
For the same reason, he also founded the weaving mill at Sparrenlech in Augsburg in 1856 with 112 looms.[1] 
Schöppler & Hartmann flourished. 
The company won a first prize at a major industrial exhibition in Berlin and Carl Forster was honored with the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle in 1845. 
In 1848, 600 employees were working on six printing presses, generating an annual output of 1 million guilders..[1] 
The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 led to sales stagnation. 
The Versailles Peace Treaty of February 26, 1871, led to the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine to the German Empire. 
The strong calico printers in Alsace competed with the German companies. 
Prices fell. 
In 1870, Ernst Forster, a son of Julius Forster, took over the management of the company, but he was unable to prevent further decline..[1] 
In 1880, three years after Karl Forster died in 1877, his heirs converted the company into a stock corporation and named it Augsburger Kattunfabrik AG. 
This was done under the management of the Augsburg banking house von Stetten.[1][2] These redevelopment efforts were unsuccessful. 
The factory facilities were obsolete. 
The depression of 1882 to 1885, which originated in the USA, also contributed to the decline of the Augsburg calico factory. 
It went bankrupt. 
The subsidiary weaving mill at Sparrenlech was auctioned off and acquired by the textile trading company Kahn & Arnold owned by Jewish entrepreneurs Aaron Kahn and Albert Arnold. 
The bankruptcy trustee sold the company to a newly founded company, Neue Augsburger Kattunfabrik AG, while operations continued..[3][4] 
Under the leadership of the banking house Friedrich Schmid & Co., the stock corporation Neue Augsburger Kattunfabrik AG was founded on January 12, 1885. 
It acquired land, machinery stocks and took over the workforce from the bankruptcy of Augsburger Kattunfabrik AG. 
Significant investments were made under the supervisory board chairman Paul Ritter von Schmid (* 1842, † 1928). 
The machinery was renewed, production rationalized and geared to mass production.[1] 
From 1903, Walter Clairmont became the new sole director and drove forward the modernization of the company. 
Nazi era 
NAK's factory premises were located in Augsburg's textile district at Vogeltorplatz in the southeast of Vogeltor. 
It was acquired by the company as early as 1705 and was located outside the city walls at that time. 
In 1937, Walter Clairmont resigned as a board member, and Fritz Piepenburg became the new board member. 
In 1938, NAK acquired the spinning and weaving mill at Sparrenlech Kahn & Arnold. 
The company had already belonged to the predecessor company Schöppler & Hartmann between 1869 and 1885. 
After the decree eliminating Jews from German economic life, Kahn and Arnold were forced to sell their company. 
Instead of a purchase price, they received shares in the NAK, which they had to exchange for Reich bonds. 
The Reich bonds were blocked for them and were worthless at the end of the war. 
The Kahn and Arnold families therefore saw nothing of the purchase price. 
Berthold Kahn was able to flee Nazi Germany with his son. 
Two Arnold brothers were deported and died in the Dachau and Theresienstadt camps. 
After the war, family members of the Kahn and Arnold families made claims for damages under Military Government Act No. 59. 
In a settlement, NAK was able to agree with the families on compensation in the amount of DM 2.8 million..[1] 
The Second World War 
During the Second World War, fabric printing almost came to a standstill. 
Camouflage fabrics were still produced for the German Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front and in Africa, as well as Reich war flags and pennants for the navy. 
In the interest of war, electrotechnical parts were produced. 
Production halls were emptied for this purpose, and three printing presses were dismantled and put into storage. 
For this production, foreign and forced laborers were now also employed.[1] 
The economic problems of the NAC are reflected in the number of employees during the Second World War. 
Postwar 
In June 1945, with the permission of the American military government, NAK resumed production with the three printing presses that had been taken out of storage during the war. 
The demand for clothing was great. 
The company's upswing did not begin until after the currency reform in 1948. 
Investments were made in machinery and the reconstruction of destroyed buildings. 
Initially, production was only order-related and mainly supplied to retailers and wholesalers, as well as department stores. 
It was not until 1960 that NAK began to deliver more to clothing manufacturers..[1] 
In 1970, the company was converted into the rare legal form of a partnership limited by shares. 
The new name was NAK Stoffe Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien. 
In 1977, Ludwig Kuttner became NAK's sole personally liable partner and held a majority share in the capital. 
Due to mismanagement and the general downturn in the textile industry, NAK's business situation deteriorated visibly. 
When Ludwig Kuttner died on March 20, 1983, NAK was on the verge of bankruptcy. 
His widow Adelheid was the sole heir. 
In addition, NAK paid her an annual pension of 380,000 DM. 
He had paid off his 11 children.[1] 
In 1983, the company was reincorporated as a pure stock corporation under the name NAK Stoffe AG. 
Werner Slansky became the new sole member of the Executive Board. 
In 1984, Adelheid Kuttner sold her NAK majority to the building contractor Walter Klaus. 
Werner Slansky remained sole director. 
He succeeded in turning the trend around. 
NAK's fabric collections became more fashionable. 
90% of customers were now clothing manufacturers. 
The export share rose to 45% of sales. 
The most important export countries became the USA, England, Italy and France. 
Sales grew considerably and in 1985 the operating result became positive for the first time in 10 years. 
In 1987, the Pegasus Group under Heiner Diechtierow took over the majority of shares from Walter Klaus. 
In the same year, the last remaining balance sheet loss was repaid and a dividend was again paid in 1988. 
In 1990, Pegasus was also able to acquire 52% of the capital of the neighboring AKS Augsburger Kammgarn-Spinnerei AG.[1] 
In mid-1991, Pegasus sold 20% of NAK's capital to Bayerische Beamten Lebensversicherung a.G. 
Three of its employees joined NAK's Supervisory Board, including Thomas Berger, who took over from Heiner Diechtierow as Chairman in February 1993. 
At the end of 1991, it was reported that Pegasus no longer owned any NAK shares. 
BBV built its NAK majority to over 50 percent by 1993. 
Pegasus sold at the right time, and sales declined steadily in the following years. 
Losses increased from DM 8.6 million to DM 30.7 million in the same period. 
NAK became a restructuring case.[1][2] 
In 1994, Werner Slansky retired from the Board of Management for reasons of health. 
He was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit for his services to Augsburg and the textile industry. 
Jürgen Bönsch, a personal friend of BBV's CEO Dieter Schweickert, became the new Chairman of the Board. 
Jürgen Bönsch, who was inexperienced in the textile industry, did not succeed in turning the company around. 
The personnel and other cost-cutting measures introduced were not effective..[1] 
Beginnings of fabric printing in Augsburg 
On March 11, 1996, Bönsch applied to the Augsburg Local Court for the opening of court composition proceedings to avert bankruptcy. 
NAK's economic situation was desolate. 
In the last five years before the insolvency proceedings, the company generated only losses with declining sales. 
The reason for the high losses was the falling demand for printed fabrics. 
Import pressure from Turkey, Eastern Europe and East Asia due to the lower wage levels there and the lack of environmental regulations increased from year to year..[1] At NAK, a lack of quality management led to high reject rates in production. 
A large proportion of the goods produced had to be sold as second choice. 
A large number of notices of defects led to payment credits. 
In February 1996, the majority stockholder and the banks involved recognized NAK's inability to restructure. 
The banks therefore terminated the credit lines at the beginning of March 1996, so that the application for a composition was unavoidable.[1] 
Bankruptcy trustee Grub continued to run the company after filing a petition for composition and, with the help of management consultants Budde & Partner, Beilstein, examined the possibilities of restructuring the company. 
Even with drastic measures, the company could not be restructured. 
NAK had a company size and cost structures that could no longer be reduced. 
Efforts by the bankruptcy trustee to find a buyer for NAK's production in Augsburg also failed. 
In view of the crisis situation in the industry, there was no interested party for the production capacities in Augsburg.[1][2] 
A social compensation plan for the employees with a total volume of DM 5.6 million was agreed upon.[1] 
The Frankfurt-based company Troostwijk was commissioned to sell the machinery. 
The sale by private treaty generated proceeds of DM 12.2 million. 
The current collections with designs and stencils were acquired by the Ulmia company in Ravensburg. 
In 1688, Gerhard Neuhofer, a draper from Augsburg, went to Holland and England to gain knowledge of calico printing, a colorful printing process for fine cotton fabrics that originated in India. 
After his return, Gerhard Neuhofer and his brother Jeremias founded the first cloth printing works on German soil in Augsburg, making the city the center for cloth printing in Germany.[1] 
The sale of further plots of land extended until 2001.[2][3] 
Bankruptcy trustee Grub ended the bankruptcy proceedings in 2002. 
The bank loans of DM 42.7 million were fully satisfied. 
Preserved to this day are the sample books and sample drawings that were collected by the company over a long period of time as the "NAK Archive". 
The fabric sample archive went to the city of Augsburg in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings for a purchase price of DM 1.2 million. 
The purchase was subsidized by the Free State of Bavaria and the Stadtsparkasse Augsburg. 
A sale abroad was not possible because on December 3, 1996, the Bavarian Ministry of Culture initiated the entry of the archive in the register of nationally valuable cultural property in accordance with §1 Para. 
1 of the Law for the Protection of German Cultural Property against Emigration (Gesetz zum Schutz deutscher Kulturgutes gegen Abwanderung)..[1] 
The fabric sample archive gives a vivid picture of the history of the company, which is over 290 years old. 
There are 560 dated fabric sample books, the oldest dating from 1792, containing a total of 1.9 million samples, most of which are also numbered. 
An additional stock of working tools such as wooden models and various objects for rouleaux printing provide insight into various fabric printing techniques.[1] 
Since 2010, the fabric sample archive has been located in a State Textile and Industry Museum built by the Free State of Bavaria in a production hall of the former Augsburger Kammgarn-Spinnerei AG. 
The decisive initiator was the trade union secretary Werner Heidler, who had already worked as a fabric printer at NAK and ensured that the fabric archive was elevated to the status of a German cultural asset.[1][2]

Flow Field Thermal Gradient Gas Chromatography (FF-TG-GC), also known as Hyper-Fast GC, is a separation method based on classical gas chromatography that uses very short separation columns, a resistively heated enveloping capillary and a negative spatial temperature gradient to perform gas chromatographic separation of substances within seconds to few minutes.[1][2] For various applications, FF-TG-GC drastically improves speed, sensitivity and selectivity over conventional gas chromatography.[3] The first FF-TG-GC prototype was developed in 2013 by Peter Boeker and Jan Leppert at the University of Bonn.[4][5] In 2017, Boeker and Paul Chambers founded the company HyperChrom SA, which has evolved, marketed and supported FF-TG-GC since then, together with HyperChrom Deutschland GmbH.[4] 
Principle of measurement 
Theoretically, the FF-TG-GC can be used with all detectors commonly used in gas chromatography. 
However, a particularly high recording frequency of the detectors is needed. As analyte peaks have very small peak widths of usually well below one second, peaks are otherwise characterised with an insufficient number of data points or are not detected at all. 
Particular practical experience exists in using especially fast flame ionisation detectors as well as quadrupole mass spectrometers (especially in SIM mode) and time-of-flight mass spectrometers (also suitable in scan mode). 
The selection of a suitable detector highly depends on the respective application. 
Column connectors 
Conventional column connectors are unsuitable for use in FF-TG-GC because they have too high an unpurged volume. 
This volume causes peaks to tail for up to several seconds, which is not relevant in conventional gas chromatography; however, in FF-TG-GC, with run times of e.g. 50 seconds, such peaktailing would be very disturbing and lead to frequent coelutions. 
The heated transitions between injector, helix tower and detector, the so-called transfer ovens, therefore include specially designed purged connectors through which different separation columns can be interconnected. 
By purging the resulting additional volume with pre-conditioned carrier gas, the negative effect on the peak shape is prevented and the use of transfer lines or guard columns is made possible without impairing the analytical results. 
This also allows the injector to be backflushed during the measurement in order to minimise the introduction of solvent-contaminated carrier gas from the injector and to avoid coelutions of early analytes with the solvent. 
Applications 
The applications for which FF-TG-GC is suitable correspond roughly to the applications for which classical gas chromatography is used as well, i.e. qualitative and quantitative analyses of highly volatile to medium volatile substances. 
However, due to the limited column length and the slightly reduced resolution, there are also unsuitable applications, especially if they require a longer separation column due to particularly challenging separation problems. 
It is therefore particularly suitable for comparatively easy separation problems where a significant increase in measuring capacity is advantageous. 
This is the case, for example, in laboratories with high sample throughput. 
This strength of the FF-TG-GC is also of enormous advantage when a short time from injection of the sample to the measurement result is required, for example in incoming goods inspections, process controls or public safety issues.[1][2][3] 
General setup 
The basic design of the FF-TG-GC corresponds to the design of a conventional gas chromatograph, consisting of an injector with gas supply, a heatable fused silica separation column and a detector, e.g. a flame ionisation detector (FID) or a mass spectrometer (MS). 
Explanatory concept diagrams can be found on the manufacturer's website.[1] 
In FF-TG-GC, the column oven used in conventional GC is replaced by a resistively heatable stainless steel envelope capillary, which is inserted helically into a support structure, the so-called helix tower. 
A 2 to 4 metre long classic, manufacturer-independent fused silica separation column is manually inserted into this enveloping capillary. 
The temperature of the enveloping capillary is measured and controlled without direct contact using IR sensors. 
Due to the low thermal mass of the heating capillary and the efficient transfer of the heat of the heating capillary to the separation column situated within, the temperature of the separation column can be controlled very quickly and precisely. 
The temperature of the separation column can be controlled over its entire course from injector to detector. 
However, the programming of fast heating rates (analogous to the oven programme in conventional gas chromatography) is limited to the main part of the column, the helix; the remaining heating zones are heated statically. 
Setup of the helix tower and principle of the negative thermal gradient 
The helix tower, which is the support structure for the heating capillary, fixes both the heating capillary and the inserted separation column in a helical channel. 
Through this channel, an air flow can be directed from inside the helix tower in a controlled manner that eliminates random convection in the vicinity of the heating capillary and thus significantly increases reproducibility. 
A so-called flow field is created. 
By using flow dampers inside the helix tower, this flow field can be adjusted in a way that a stronger air flow is directed over the heating capillary in the lower area of the helix (which is closer to the detector). 
The result is a continuous, stronger cooling of the column section closer to the detector; a negative spatial temperature gradient is created. Both the flow field and the thermal gradient give the technology its name. 
With temporal temperature programming only, as is common in classical gas chromatography, an analyte will begin to migrate along the column when it reaches a certain temperature. 
During the migration to the detector, the temperature of the column increases following the temporal temperature programme, causing the analyte peak to broaden. 
Due to the negative temperature gradient, the analyte migrates across the column at a constant temperature, and the peak broadening does not occur. 
Physically, this effect can also be explained by a temperature-induced slow peak front at comparatively high velocities of the analytes in the peaktail. 
The combination of these effects leads to a spatial peak focussing. 
The negative thermal gradient thus increases the chromatographic resolution and reduces the elution temperature at the same time, which is particularly advantageous for temperature-sensitive analytes such as explosives.[1] 
In addition, the helix tower offers the possibility of water cooling via an external recirculating chiller. The chiller keeps the environment of the separation column thermally very stable and minimises retention time fluctuations. 
In addition, this enables starting temperatures from 25 °C.

Leslie Tarlton, in 1905 
He was the leader of numerous safaris, including the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition of 1909–1910. 
The route ran from Mombasa in British East Africa to the Belgian Congo, on to the Nile and up the river to Khartoum. 
Theodore Roosevelt and his son Kermit shot 512 big game alone. 
Throughout the expedition Cuninghame was responsible for the selection and guidance of the almost 200 porters as well as the askari and the servants for weapons, horses and tents, assisted by Tarlton.[1] A few months after the expedition, in July 1910, Tarlton traveled to the United States. 
He visited Roosevelt's ranch and was shown the first American national parks.[1] 
In 1925 Tarlton led the US bow hunter Saxton Pope on a lion hunt. 
Pope shot seven lions with his bow. 
However, Tarlton forbade him from bow hunting buffalo, elephant and rhino because he was concerned that Pope could only wound an animal and provoke an attack. 
In the 1930s Leslie Tarlton ran safaris for the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII ) and the Duke of York (later George VI). 
The Tarltons took an active part in the life of the white upper class in British East Africa. 
Leslie Tarlton's brother Henry was considered one of the best jockeys in the colony.[1]

Youth and Second Boer War 
Leslie Tarlton was born in South Australia to Robert Tarlton, a banker and politician. 
He first attended Prince Alfred's College, Adelaide. 
In 1889 the family moved to Tasmania, hoping the climate would alleviate the eldest son Tatham 's tuberculosis. 
Leslie was attending Launceston High School in Tasmania at the time. 
As his brother's health continued to deteriorate, he moved to the Transvaal Highlands in the South African Republic. 
In 1894, also encouraged by the news of gold discoveries in the Transvaal, Robert Tarlton and his large family followed. 
Tatham died that same year, but the Tarltons stayed in South Africa. 
The three eldest of the surviving sons, including Leslie, enlisted in the first contingent of the South Australian Mounted Rifles and fought in the Second Boer War.[1] 
Big game hunters and entrepreneurs in East Africa 
After the war, numerous British veterans, including Leslie, his brother Henry and an Adelaide friend Victor Newland, trekked around British East Africa and German East Africa as soldiers of fortune. 
Some bought land or got a place in the soldiers' camps in British East Africa, others hired themselves out as guides for wealthy tourists from Europe and the United States. 
The Tarlton brothers and Newland arrived in Nairobi in 1903, which had been established a few years earlier as a railroad warehouse and supply depot. 
The city at that time was just a collection of tin sheds.[1] 
In 1904 the Tarltons and Newland were able to raise a seed capital of £ 200 with which they founded Newland , Tarlton & Co. 
The company was the first professional safari outfitter and quickly found great success organizing safaris for European and American hunting tourists. 
Leslie Tarlton was responsible for the organization at "N & T" and left the finances to Victor Newland. 
Tarlton personally accompanied expeditions by important customers, such as that of Carl and Delia Akeley in 1906. 
He was an excellent hunter of Cape buffalo, elephant and rhino, but his high reputation was based on his skill at lion hunting. 
Hunting lions was particularly dangerous. 
Twice Tarlton was injured by a charging lion and several of his hunters lost their lives on the job.[1][2][1] 
Leslie Tarlton with Theodore Roosevelt, 1909 
Tarlton's most important expedition was the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition from April 1909 to March 1910, in which he served as hunter and guide. 
Theodore Roosevelt was leader of the expedition and wanted to take over the organization himself. 
Only after being urged by Frederick Selous did he give in and hand over the organization to Newland, Tarlton & Co. in Nairobi. 
The expedition was led by Richard John Cuninghame, who was recommended to Roosevelt as the best elephant hunter in Africa.[1] Roosevelt followed Cuninghame's advice and hired a second white hunter, Tarlton, as his "adjutant" for the time in East Africa, since no one could lead a year-long expedition with 250 men alone. 
Tarlton occasionally went on short hunting trips away from the large group with Kermit Roosevelt.[2][3] Kermit Roosevelt later stated that Cuninghame's marksmanship matched that of his father. 
But both were surpassed by Tarlton.[4] The enormous number of animals shot meant that Edmund Heller, who was also employed as a taxidermist, often had to be assisted by Cuninghame. 
Occasionally Tarlton had to be called in for this work as well.[5] 
After completing his Ph.D., Meijer spent a year as a post-doc at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San José, California, where he worked on laser desorption mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy, as well as fullerene research. He then returned to Radboud University as a University Lecturer, where he continued his research on cavity ring down spectroscopy and fullerene crystals. In 1995, Meijer was appointed as a Full Professor in Experimental Physics at Radboud University, where he continued his research on laser-based spectroscopic techniques and cold molecules.

Discography 
View into the competition hall at the 25th Rheintalcup 2022 
The Rheintalcup is the only international artistic gymnastics tournament for male juniors and seniors in Switzerland. 
With the exception of the first edition in 1995, the competition took place in Widnau in St. Gallen Rhine Valley. 
The Rheintalcup serves older gymnasts as a qualifying competition for various national and international competitions in the junior and senior sections. 
On a second day of competition, younger Swiss gymnasts compete there as part of the annual Eastern Switzerland Cup. 
Friday: Setup and training 
Since the competition weekend cannot take place in the small training hall of the TZ Rheintal, the multi-purpose hall in the Sportzentrum Aegeten in Widnau will be used for the event. 
The mats prescribed by the International Gymnastics Federation and the six pieces of Olympic gymnastics apparatus are set up on the hall floor by club volunteers. 
As is usual in international competitions, there will be a podium training session on the set-up apparatus before the competition, which will allow the gymnasts to make final preparations. 
On the one hand, the special features of these devices should be learned in order to adapt to the competition. 
On the other hand, entire exercises or relevant elements can be tried out again on the equipment on site in order to determine the final exercise for the competition together with the trainer. 
Since the training for juniors and seniors from all participating countries is designed as free training, there is also the opportunity to get to know gymnasts and their elements better in advance. 
However, there is no obligation to participate in this training. 
In a concluding technical session, the demands and needs of the delegations for the devices will also be discussed.

Saturday: International competition 
The international competition consists of several parts: an all-around for juniors, an all-around for seniors and an apparatus or team final. 
Since 2015, the two all-around competitions with open freestyle exercises have been taking place in accordance with the rules of the International Gymnastics Federation (Swiss program 6). 
The difficulty and execution of the exercises will be judged by a panel of judges composed of members of the participating nations according to the international Code of Points. 
In previous years, the juniors could compete in the Swiss program 5, which includes compulsory and bonus elements and is evaluated differently accordingly. 
If too many gymnasts are registered for the all-around competitions, the competitions can take place in several subdivisions. 
There is no obligation to participate on all devices. 
The winner of the all-around is the person with the highest number of points of all participants, and the cantonal champion for St. Gallen in program 6 is also determined. 
The following countries have taken part in the international competitions so far: Belgium, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Germany, England, France, Italy, Japan, Croatia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Russia, the Czech Republic and Hungary.[1][2] At the same time, there is a competition in the open program in which Swiss amateur gymnasts compete. 
Here only the four best gymnastics devices are judged and the winner is awarded separately. 
The all-around competitions at the Rheintalcup serve the Swiss gymnasts as qualifying competitions for their national championships. 
Occasionally, official qualifications for national and international competitions in the junior and senior sections also take place at the Rheintalcup.[1][2] For example, the qualification for the Junior and Senior European Championships 2014 and the qualification for the European Olympic Youth Festival in the same year were held there for the Swiss gymnasts. 
The Rheintalcup in 2022 was officially recognized as a qualifying competition for the Universiade. 
In the evening after the all-around competitions, an apparatus final in the junior and senior sections on the three apparatuses floor, parallel bars and horizontal bar take place.[1] Occasionally, as at the 25th Rheintalcup, team finals of the best participating nations take place, in which a junior and a senior gymnast have to collect points together on the same apparatus in order to determine the winning country.[2] 
In the context of the international competition, there are often other activities such as a sponsored aperitif or a raffle. 
Sunday: Ostschweizer Cup 
After a modification of the hall for younger gymnasts, competitions in the Swiss categories introductory program to program 4 take place on Sunday exclusively for Swiss junior gymnasts aged six to 13 years. 
Since these competitions are part of the Ostschweizer Cup (Eastern Swiss Cup),[1][2] gymnasts mainly from these regions take part. 
In addition to the organizing TZ Rheintal, this also includes the gymnastics centers in Fürstenland and Graubünden, the Turnfabrik (gymnatics factury) in the canton of Thurgau and the Regionales Leistungszentrum Ost (Regional Performance Center East) in Wil (from program 3 on). 
In addition to the gymnasts from Eastern Switzerland, juniors from other regions, for example from the cantons of Aargau, Schaffhausen and Zurich, also take part.[3] The competitions within the Ostschweizer Cup serve as qualification competitions for the Swiss Junior Championships and as a cantonal championship in St. Gallen.[4][5] 
The competitions are also held as all-arounds. 
In some cases, programs are combined in one run if the number of participants is low. 
The six Olympic apparatuses are adapted for the younger gymnasts in each program. 
This includes the modification of jumping tracks with mini-trampolines instead of springboards, smaller parallel bars and additions to the regulr pommel horse with two pommels such as a gymnastic mushroom without or with a pommel, horses on the ground or horses without pommels. 
A panel of judges composed of the participating clubs evaluates compulsory and bonus elements according to the Swiss adaptations of the international Code of Points for these programs. 
The winner of the all-around is the person with the highest number of points of all participants per program. 
In addition, the cantonal champion is awarded in the various programs.

Artistic gymnastics competitions were held in the St. Gallen Rhine Valley between 1985 and 1994. 
Before the first Rheintalcup took place in the Oberstufenzentrum Kleewies (high school) on 9 April 1995, the Meyer Cup was held ten times in Diepoldsau at the same place. 
The competition got its name from the region. 
Since the second edition in 1996, the competition has been held annually in Widnau, most recently in the Sporthalle Aegeten (sports hall). 
The 25th anniversary edition, which was already planned in these years, was deferred to 2022. 
In the beginning, the competition only consisted of a regional part, in later years it was supplemented by an international part.[1] 
Organization 
The organizer of the competition is the Turnzentrum Rheintal (Gymnastic Centre). 
The association was founded in 1995 by the TZ Diepoldau (later KTZ Diepoldsau-Schmitter) and offers training opportunities for boys from 4 to 13 years of age before they can qualify for training in the Regionales Leistungszentrum Ost (Regional Training Center East) in Wil. 
The competitions at the Rheintalcup take place early in the competition year and often serve as orientation for the gymnasts.[1][2] Unlike other international competitions in other countries, the largest international competition in artistic gymnastics for male juniors and seniors in Switzerland is not organized by a national but by a local organizer.[3] The Swiss Cup, which has an even higher international profile and takes place at the end of the competition year, offers a kind of cup competition with duels between two countries and separates the junior and senior competitions instead of an all-around competition with finals. 
As is usual with other competitions of this kind, the Rheintalcup is supported not only by entry fees, but also primarily by sponsorship, raffles and the committment of volunteers from the association, and generates a quarter of the annual budget of the Turnzentrum Rheintal.[1] In addition to show competitions by local gymnastics groups, majorettes from the Czech Republic are part of the program and show their exercises at the award ceremonies and accompany the gymnasts when they march in and change apparatus during the competitions.[1] In the Sportzentrum Aegeten itself there are rooms for participants in the competition.[2]

After graduating from the König-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Breslau, Senftleben studied physics at the University of Breslau and received his doctorate with Rudolf Ladenburg. The dissertation was about the glow of flames, which he attributed in part to light scattering from small particles in the flame. He was then an assistant in Breslau (with Carl Hintze, Arnold Eucken and Otto Lummer) and Marburg (with Clemens Schaefer), where he habilitated in 1924 and became a privatdozent at University of Marburg.

Family 
Karl August von Witzleben was married four times. 
All of his wives (whose first names begin with an A) were around 19 years old at the time of the marriage, which was not always understood, especially his marriage to Auguste in which she was more than 32 years younger: 
“[…] A. von Tromlitz (Karl August von Witzleben), a tall, stately, very courageous-looking, albeit elderly gentleman. […] I, on the other hand, could not understand at all how a beautiful young lady could have decided to marry him […]. 
Pappenheimer was the last work by Tromlitzen that I read; they, whose struggle he compared to lions and tigers, took away all my desire to repeat such terrifying scenes. 
It was only later, when Saphir said: A gentle way of dying for him should consist in chasing a Tromlitz novel through his head , did I realize why Tromlitz's creations failed to inspire me. 
He is said to have lived on his vineyard for many more years, carefully looked after by the lovely woman, which I begrudged him from the bottom of my heart – despite the Pappenheimers .” — Karoline Bauer: Erinnerungen[1] 
The marriage with Auguste seems to have been very harmonious, despite the great age difference between the two. 
Shortly before his death Tromlitz writes: 
An Auguste …… […] Now take it, you angel of my life, You my staff and consolation at the goal of my path, Accept the songs kindly from me, And the imagination did not create them in vain. 
and (from a third marriage) the later Chamberlain Hermann von Witzleben.

Baumgärtner, Leipzig 1828–1839 (continued by Theodor Mügge) 
His maternal grandfather was the salt works owner Johann Christoph von Stecher. 
Life and Work 
He received his education at the Gymnasium in Halle. 
He came to the court in Weimar as a page. 
There Johann Karl August Musäus and Johann Gottfried Herder were his teachers. 
But in 1786 he went into Prussian service and took part in the War of the First Coalition. 
During the War of the Fourth Coalition, he was in the Duke of Brunswick's headquarters during the Battle of Jena and then took part in the retreat with Hohenlohe, before being taken prisoner near Prenzlau. 
There he met the French Marshal Murat (at the time Grand Duke of Berg). 
After this, According to the Peace of Tilsit , all foreigners had to leave the Prussian army, including Witzleben. 
He switched to Bergisch services and initially became a captain in the infantry. 
He soon became squadron chief in the Berg Lancer Regiment. 
In 1809 he became a major and formed a new regiment of Lancers in Munster, of which he became commander in 1811. 
With the regiment, he took part in Napoleon's campaign in Spain. 
The regiment returned to Berg in 1812. 
When Prussia declared war on France in 1813, he switched to Russian service and ultimately commanded the Hanseatic Legion at the rank of Colonel. 
After the Peace of Paris, he lived as a farmer on his wife's manors in Beuchlitz near Halle, he moved to Berlin in 1821 and to Dresden in 1826.[1] 
In 1831 he acquired the Kynast winery in Zitzschewig (today a district of Radebeul ) just outside of Dresden in order to spend the rest of his life as a writer. 
He was very successful as a writer of entertaining novellas with a historical background. 
A. von Tromlitz' grave in the Neustadt Cemetery in Dresden 
"It was not without justification that he was reproached with used motifs, especially in his later works, but especially that the fact that in the choice of his historical subjects he limited himself too much to a sphere, that of the Thirty Years' War and despite this never turned into one have raised a higher historical view. 
Nevertheless, he has acquired a large audience through tireless work and a generally lively performance." — Meyer's Konversations-Lexikon, 1853 
"His stories sometimes suffer from the trickiness of the language and the arbitrariness of the invention, his historical novels at least tried to offer the reading world stronger fare than was usual at the time, and the great interest that his works found speaks for the readers deeming the intention achieved.” — Karl Goedeke: Grundriß zur Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung aus den Quellen, 1881

Myron Levoy grew up in the borough of Queens, New York City. 
His mother was Hungarian, and his father was a Jewish immigrant from Hanover. 
As a child, Myron showed affinity for writing literature. 
He later studied engineering at Purdue University. 
He originally worked in the field of space engineering. 
He first began writing poetry, comedy, and short stories for children, and when he became successful in children's stories, he concentrated on writing. 
Myron Levoy lived with his wife and two children in Rockaway, New Jersey. 
His books, in which socially marginalized characters were often at the center of the plot, are not only directed against prejudice and racism, but also describe the problems of finding one's identity and standing up for oneself. 
Myron Levoy was actively involved in the American peace movement and also participated with his family in the anti-nuclear protests during the Cold War, in New York City in June 1982. 
He has published poetry, plays, a novel, several short stories for children, a picture book, and two books for young adults. 
His first novel, A Necktie in Greenwich Village, was published in 1968. 
His book Alan and Naomi, was awarded the German Youth Literature Prize in 1982 (as well as numerous other prizes). The book was adapted into a film of the same name.

Awards and Honors 
Frank N. Keutsch (born in Tübingen) is a German chemist and a researcher on solar geoengineering. 
From 1992 Keutsch studied chemistry with Vladimir E. Bondybey in Munich with a scholarship from the German National Academic Foundation. 
After graduating in 1997, Keutsch moved to the University of California at Berkeley, where he received his Ph.D. in physical chemistry. 
His supervisor was Richard J. Saykally. 
Keutsch then went to Harvard University as a postdoc, where he worked on stratospheric chemistry under the supervision of James G. Anderson. Keutsch began his independent academic career in 2005 as an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Eventually, he accepted the call to the Stonington Professorship in Atmospheric Engineering and Science at Harvard University. 
After completing his doctorate, he moved to a research laboratory at BASF in Ludwigshafen-Oppau. Brill published the first work on electron densities in crystals and established the experimental determination of electron densities. In 1941, Brill became the successor to Eduard Zintl, who had died in January 1941, at the Technical University of Darmstadt. 
Brill was appointed to the Chair of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry and at the same time was made head of the institute. Due to his special professional and organizational skills, Brill was the only candidate that the university suggested to the state government. As the successor to Eduard Zintl, who was promoted by Gauleiter Jakob Sprenger, Brill had a new building, about half-completed, with generous financial and human resources at his disposal. 
In 1942, his institute for inorganic and physical chemistry was classified as a "military enterprise", which was associated with certain privileges for the institute. After the American army marched into Darmstadt in March 1945, the usable parts of the new institute building at Herrngarten were used as a medical center. As a result, there were practically no more job opportunities for Brill.

Temporal hours or temporal hours are the former division of the light day and night into 12 sections each, regardless of the season. They are also called biblical or Jewish hours and ancient or Roman hours, Latin horae temporales. 
They are sections of time of unequal length because the light day is longer in summer than in winter (vice versa for night). Their use in everyday life was replaced from the late Middle Ages by the equinoctial hours of equal length common today.

The first month day in the ancient Egyptian lunar calendar began on the day "of the disappearance of the old light moon crescent" at dawn before sunrise. Since the last night hours belonged to the "old day", the non-visibility of the moon was a reliable signal immediately before the rising sun. At new moon, the sighting of a moon crescent is generally not possible, as the moonrise takes place almost simultaneously with the sun without a moon crescent formation and the new light moon cannot be seen with the naked eye. 
The transformation of "Re in Heliopolis as the sun of the day" into the evening form of Atum illustrates the special situation of the "interval of Re". In this sense, the first two night hours could still be counted as part of the day in ancient Egyptian mythology, as the "hours of the night" originally began with the "swallowing of Re". This was also the case for the last two hours of the night, in which Re left the Duat during the "birth process" but had not yet reached the horizon and appeared as dawn in the form of the deity Chepri. 
Calendar Definition 
Day 
It is therefore possible that the literature of those Egyptologists is used as a basis for defining the beginning of the day from dawn, while at the same time defining the beginning of the day from sunrise at another point. For example, Richard Anthony Parker and Otto Neugebauer explain: Error: No text given for quotation (or equals sign used in the actual argument to an unnamed parameter) Preview warning: Page using Template:Blockquote with unknown parameter "Text" The significantly improved astronomical calculation possibilities and the emergence of new text sources have led to reevaluations of historical texts and corrections of incorrect statements in the existing older literature in Egyptology. Egyptologists and astronomers uniformly confirm that instead of the "invisible 70 days of Sirius" mentioned in ancient Egyptian sources, a period of "invisible 50 days" occurred in the Early Dynastic Period.

From 1950 at the latest, Richard Hessberg pursued his return migration to Germany, where he had already been staying since at least 1948. 
In October 1952, he returned to Essen in retirement, but continued his scientific work and again supervised the municipal "Sehschonungsschule" which he had founded. 
He died in 1960 in his hometown Essen. 
Publications 
Richard Hessberg was the son of an ophthalmologist in Essen. 
After attending school in Essen and Höxter (Abitur) and studying medicine, he obtained his doctorate in Munich in 1904. 
Back in Essen, he took over his father's practice and was also a miners' physician. 
In 1913, he was appointed chief physician of the eye clinic of the Municipal Hospitals in Essen on a part-time basis, "as it seemed desirable for the occupancy of the clinic that he could still maintain his panel practice". 
He married the non-Jewish Grete Koenecke from Düsseldorf and had three children with her. 
During this time he converted to Protestantism. 
The marriage was divorced in 1934. 
In addition to his practice and his work as chief physician, he published numerous scientific papers, successfully campaigned for the institutionalization of continuing medical education, and held an important position with the Ophthalmology Department of the "Society for Science and Life in the Rhenish-Westphalian Industrial District," at whose meetings he acted as rapporteur on several occasions. 
Among other things, a commemorative publication was dedicated to him at the 48th German Medical Congress in Essen in 1929. 
In addition to his professional activities, he was also involved in politics and literature. 
During the Weimar Republic, he was a member of the German People's Party. 
He was a member of the board of directors of the Folkwang Art Association and managing director of the "Society for Literature and Theater" in Essen. 
Dr. Hessberg was also a member of the Society for Bibliophilia, to which he donated a letter from Karl Immermann to Heinrich Heine in 1925. 
In 1920, Thomas Mann stayed with him. 
In 1929, the family of five moved into a villa in Essen-Bredeney, built according to the plans of the well-known architect Alfred Fischer, a representative of New Building (New Objectivity, Bauhaus), with which the Hessberg family had long been acquainted. 
At the end of 1933, he had to stop working at the Essen Eye Clinic. 
His previous income of about 2,200 marks per month was thus reduced to about 515 marks. 
In October 1938, his medical license was also revoked, and in the wake of the Pogrom Night he was imprisoned for five weeks until mid-December. 
While the children from the "privileged mixed marriage" remained in Germany, Richard Hessberg fled after selling his assets in May 1939, first to Bonstetten in Switzerland, from where he wanted to emigrate to Central America. 
He eventually emigrated to Cuba via Spain. 
Due to a lack of job opportunities there, he went to the USA in 1944, worked as an ophthalmologist in New York and obtained American citizenship. 
After the war, the marriage was recognized by the city of Hamburg retroactively from 1935, because the two had become engaged in 1935 but were not allowed to marry because of Nazi racial laws. 
He joined the Halle orphanage in 1720. He went to Tranquebar as part of the Danish Halle Mission leaving Halle on December 8, 1724 to Rotterdam, and then to London where he met members of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.

Road blocks at Berlin Central station (2022) 
The Last Generation is a group of climate activists that uses nonviolent resistance.[1] In German, they have been dubbed Klimakleber, "climate gluers", because they often glue themselves to the street. In 2022, the group performed 276 road blockades.[2] In Rome, they threw soup at The Sower [it] by Vincent van Gogh.[3][4] 
Methods

History of actions 
The Last Generation state that they have performed 370 actions between January and October 2022.[1] 
The group was formed by participants of the 2021 Hungerstreik der letzten Generation [de] which blockaded highways in Berlin. 
They chose the name to signal that Earth is approaching climate tipping points and that their generation is the last to prevent climate collapse.[1] 
Goals and topics 
Die group states that there is a climate emergency,[1] and demands that citizens decide their own future via citizens' assemblies, while the cost of solving the crisis should not be borne by workers, but rather by the rich. 
The group demands a debt cut and monies paid to states of the Global South, as compensation for climate change.[2]

Climbing areas are often not clearly delineated, so that various competing classifications based on different criteria can be found in the literature. 
Furthermore, climbing areas can be further subdivided hierarchically into individual subgroups, climbing crags, climbing gardens or sectors and have very different sizes.[1] In many cases, the definition and delineation of territory, including subdivision into subareas, is carried out by the respective Kletterführerautoren.

Shibrain studied Fine Arts at the School of Design at the Khartoum Technical Institute (KTI), that later became the College of Fine and Applied Art in Khartoum, and at the Central School of Art and Design in London. 
In 1972, he was Commissioner for Art in the Sudanese Ministry of Youth and later also Secretary of Culture in the Ministry of Culture and Information. 
In 1975, he became dean of the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the Sudan University for Science and Technology.[1] 
Along with Ibrahim El-Salahi, Shibrain is considered one of the leading representatives of the Khartoum School, which combines Islamic, African and Western artistic traditions.[1] Both artists are also representatives of the so-called hurufiyya-movement (derived from the Arabic word for letter) as they developed contemporary pictorial representation from traditional Arabic calligraphy.[2] Shibrain's large-format calligraphy, in which the words of Islamic texts are interpreted as independent ornaments and images, attracted international attention.[3][4]

Aided Cheit maic Mágach [ ] („The Death of Cet mac Mágach“) is the name of an irish Ulster Cycle's saga about a duel between Conall Cernach and Cet mac Mágach and the cunning of Bélchú. 
In the saga Scéla mucce Meic Dathó ("The Story of Mac Dathó's Pig"), the Connacht warrior Cet mac Mágach argues with Conall Cernach over the hero's bite. 
The weaker Cet eventually relents, but severely insults Conall.[1] When Cet later kills several warriors during a raid on Ulster, Conall kills Cet in a bloody duel, but is also badly wounded. 
A briuga (landowner) named Bélchú takes the injured man to his house, but announces a fight to the death after he recovers. 
However, knowing Conall's strength in battle, Bélchú instigates his three sons to murder the man sleeping in his bed. 
Conall, presenting the deed, ties Bélchú to the bed and so he is speared to death by his own sons. 
Conall then kills all three of them and cuts off the head of the three sons and their father and take them home as trophies

His hometown of Crooksville was characterized by mining and formed the basis (fictitiously identified as "Wiggam's Glory, Ohio") for several of his books. 
A major character in the novels aspires to leave mining but does not succeed, thereafter setting his hopes on his son, who then attended Harvard University and escaped southeastern Ohio. 
Brown himself graduated from Ohio Northern University in 1903 and earned a master's degree from Harvard University in 1905. 
He was married to Ella Abigail Brocklesby. 
With several books (The Art of Writing English, How the French Boy Learns to Write, and The Writer's Art), he shared his knowledge of written rhetoric with a large audience. 
He believed, in the end, that he could better use his talents outside the classroom, thereafter devoting himself entirely to journalism. 
He collected articles and published them as books, such as The Creative Spirit: An Inquiry into American Life (1925). 
Brown evolved into a biographer. 
As a summer resident at MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, Brown formed an intimate friendship with the poet Edwin Arlington Robinson; his book Next Door to a Poet was dedicated to him. 
In addition to a series of four novels (The Firemakers, Toward Romance, The Hillikin, and As of the Gods) dealing with labor unions and the coal industry in Ohio, his fascination with literary portraiture continued, such as the haunting observations in I Travel by Train (1939). 
Lonely Americans (1929) captured the feel of the USA during the Depression Era. 
He was a sought-after keynote speaker.[1] He was against mixed universities because it was at the expense of the humanities; men would leave the fine arts subjects to women in the case of a mixed student body.[2]

Most Famous Poem 
Ah, our radiant days Sparkle like eternal stars. As a solace for future lamentation They glow from the golden distance. Do not weep because they are past! 
Ludwig Jacobowski was born in Strelno, the third son of a Jewish merchant. 
In April 1874 the family moved to Berlin. 
Here Jacobowski attended the Lutheran boys' school and the Luisenstädter Oberrealschule. 
After graduating from high school in 1887, he studied literature, philosophy and history at the Humboldt University in Berlin . 
In 1889 he moved to Freiburg im Breisgau and received his doctorate there in 1891 with his work Klinger und Shakespeare - a contribution to Shakespearomanie of the storm and stress period . 
During his studies he became a member of the Franconia Freiburg fraternity in 1889 . 
In 1889 he published his first volume of poetry: From moving hours . 
In 1890, together with Richard Zoozmann , he founded the magazine Der Zeitgenosse , whose program was "to let everyone who has a whole individuality have their say" . 
Despite the collaboration of well-known authors such as Detlev von Liliencron , Gustav Falke and Karl Bleibtreu , the paper was published within a year. 
Jacobowski wrote for over 30 newspapers and magazines over the next ten years. 
He was co-editor of the semi-monthly for life, criticism and poetry . 
Later he also became editor of the journal Die Gesellschaft. 
Semi-monthly for literature, art and social policy . 
In the last year of his life, he founded a free reading circle called The Coming Ones , which met weekly for readings and lectures in the Nollendorf Casino. 
Ludwig Jacobowski was close friends with Rudolf Steiner , to whom he entrusted his literary estate . 
After Jacobowski's death, Steiner published two volumes of posthumous poems and prose texts and took over the management of the coming ones . 
Ludwig Jacobowski died on December 2, 1900 at the age of 32 in Berlin (Krankenhaus am Urban) as a result of meningitis . 
Importance 
Beyond his literary work, the importance of Ludwig Jacobowski lies in his representative work in Berlin at the turn of the century. 
The merging of Jewish and Western cultural impulses led to an extraordinarily rich work in the most diverse social areas. 
In addition to the extensive journalistic support of his time, his commitment to folk education should also be mentioned here, especially his attempt to make valuable literature available to the general public with "Zehnpfennig-Heften". 
His work in the Association for the Defense of Anti-Semitism , founded in 1890, was also reflected in his work. 
He was Professor at Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University in Frankfurt. 
"Bolometer geringer Trägheit".

He was the son of the pediatrician Adalbert Czerny, his mother was the daughter of a large landowner in Upper Silesia. 
He attended high school in Strasbourg and later achieved the rank of lieutenant in the Guards Infantry. 
His left elbow was shot through in 1916 during World War I. From 1918 he studied at the Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg and then at the University of Berlin. 
In 1923 he received his doctorate in Berlin with a dissertation in infrared physics entitled Über eine neue Form der Rubensschen Reststrahlmethode (On a new form of Rubens' residual beam method), which he began under Heinrich Rubens and which was supervised by Gerhard Hettner after his death. 
He then became an assistant at the Physics Institute. 
Czerny attracted attention at the time when, following the Stern-Gerlach experiment (1922), which demonstrated the existence of half-integer quantum numbers in electron spin, he also found them in the rotation bands of molecules (gaseous hydrogen halides). 
His subsequent study of the rotation bands on alkali halide crystals (with R. Bowling Barnes, C. H. Cartwright) provided the first evidence of what were later described as multiphonon effects. 
His predecessor Karl Wilhelm Meissner, who wanted to bring Czerny to Frankfurt in 1934, had previously been dismissed there by the National Socialists. 
Initially, Czerny had to pay for the equipment for infrared spectroscopy out of his own pocket, since the institute in Frankfurt had previously operated optical spectroscopy. 
During the Second World War, his institute was largely destroyed by bombing raids. 
After the war, in 1947, he spent six months in military research for the US Navy in California. 
After the war he led the slow reconstruction of the Physics Institute and retired in 1961. 
However, Czerny worked until 1976 in the internship for beginners. 
He died in a retirement home in Munich. 
Czerny continued the research of the infrared spectral range from (at Rubens) to 300 microns wavelength up to about 1400 microns by developing new measuring methods and apparatuses begun by his teacher Rubens. 
During his time in Berlin, he was also known for his work with A. F. Turner and the doctoral student V. Plettig on astigmatism in mirror spectrometers.[1] He dealt with thermal limits of measurement (which was by no means common knowledge in the 1920s), techniques of infrared photography (evaporography) and, in World War II, sensitivity of the eye to high-intensity infrared (important in why Allied bomber crews apparently used the infrared - could detect anti-aircraft headlights). 
The insensitivity to infrared is an adaptation of the visual system to the thermal radiation of one's own blood, as Czerny showed in 1949.[2] In 1972 he published a paper on changes in the optics and vision of the eye after cataract surgery (e.g. greater sensitivity in the ultraviolet).[3] After World War II he published on lightweight bolometers,[4] the beginnings of the later alternating light process. 
He also dealt with application problems in the glass industry (heat conduction by radiation). 
In his spare time he played the cello and made music with Albert Einstein and Max Planck during his time in Berlin.[1] 
In 1966 he received an honorary doctorate in Göttingen. 
Czerny married Octavia Gaupp in 1934. 
She was chargé d'affaires of the embassy in Germany from June 2020 to June 2021.

Honors and awards 
Typical Mainzer Fastnachtsbütt mit der Eule 
A Büttenrede is a humorous speech originating in the West-German cultural tradition that is given for carnival, usually performed at carnival conventions, revue-like events organized by carnival societies. 
They are often rhymed and are performed from a special lectern called a bütt (rhenish franconian/moselle franconian/colognian/rhinelandic for barrel) in a local German dialect. 
Over the last few decades, Büttenreden have also become more popular in East Germany, especially at the Berlin carnival. 
Origin 
The Büttenrede can be traced back to the medieval practice of "Rügerecht", through which peasants were allowed to freely criticize their rulers during carnival without fear of retribution. 
Rhyme structure 
Structurally, the traditional rhymed Büttenrede is known to use a very consistent metre, for example iambic pentameter. 
It is often divided into multiple stanzas, that, like a refrain, end in the same, reoccurring punch line. 
The preferred rhyming scheme is a couplet (aa-bb). 
Forms 
Especially in the Rhenish carnival tradition, the structure of the traditional Büttenrede has undergone many changes. 
The spectrum of Büttenreden nowadays ranges from elements of stand-up comedy and sung interludes to dialogues and ventriloquism. 
Even the "bütt" itself is only rarely visible, although this is usually for technical reasons. 
The content of the speeches has also gradually shifted from an expository, ironic mirroring of society to merely performing a collection of jokes. 
The Subarachnoid Lymphatic-like Membrane (SLYM) is an anatomical structure in the human brain that represents a fourth layer of the meninges. 
The SLYM is located in the subarachnoid space, the space between the middle reticular meninges and the innermost tender meninges that lie close to the brain.[1] It divides the subarachnoid space into an outer, superficial compartment and an inner, deeper area surrounding the brain.[1] 
Structure 
The SLYM is very thin, but consists of several cell layers and contains its own immune cells.[1] It is similar in structure to the lymphatic vessels in the body and could therefore play an important role in immune protection and fluid balance in the brain.[1] It consists of only a few layers of cells and is similar in nature to the mesothelium. The SLYM prevents larger molecules such as peptides and proteins from passing into the interior of the brain and could thus assume a barrier function.[1] 
Discovery and importance 
According to the publication in 2023, the SLYM is a newly discovered anatomical structure in the human brain.[1] The discovery of the SLYM represents an important addition to existing anatomical knowledge and may contribute to new insights into brain function and potential therapeutic approaches.[2] However, further studies are needed to better understand the exact function and potential clinical relevance of the SLYM.

Ther grew up in Bavaria. 
His father, Otto Ther, directed several educational institutions, including the Outward Bound schools in Baad and Berchtesgaden. For a time he also taught at the German School in Istanbul, where Philipp Ther spent part of his childhood.[1] 
Ther studied Modern History, Eastern European History, Sociology and Political Science at the Universities of Regensburg and Munich from 1988 to 1992. 
He lived in Ukraine and Poland for several years. 
Ther graduated in 1993 from Georgetown University with a Master’s Degree. 
In 1997/1998, he was a John F. Kennedy Fellow at the Center for European Studies at Harvard University. 
Subsequently, he was a research associate at the Center for Comparative European History at Freie Universität Berlin until 2002. 
In 2002, he worked as junior professor for Polish and Ukrainian studies at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder), where he published his habilitation on the political and social function of the opera house in the 19th century. 
Ther gained recognition as an expert on the history of expulsion and displacement in Europe and publicly criticized the German Federation of Expellees, whose policies he described as not being aimed at reconciliation even after the end of the Cold War. 
The federation's then president Erika Steinbach subsequently intervened by lodging a complaint with Ther's publishing house Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. 
The publisher released this letter to the public and described it as "brazen meddling" [1] 
After receiving the Wittgenstein Award in 2019 he founded the Research Center for the History of Transformations (RECET), an interdisciplinary research institution focusing on transformation processes in Eastern and Central Europe.[1] 
In July 22, it became public that a selection committee at Viadrina University proposed the historian as the only candidate to be elected university president.[1] Philipp Ther rejected the offer in August 2022.[2]

Luterbacher is a member of ProClim, the forum for climate and global environmental change of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. 
They initially lived in Switzerland and England, from where the management of all their business in Central Europe was carried out via straw men. 
Subsequently, all of them moved to the USA by September 1939.[3] 
Franz Petschek was the last to leave Aussig in early September 1938.[1] After the Treaty of Munich, the Nazis gained access to the business premises in Aussig in October 1938.[2] 
In November 1938 Franz Petschek fled to Brazil and emigrated to the USA in 1940.,[1] and became a naturalised citizen.[2] In the process, he changed his first names to Frank Conrad and settled with his wife in New York City. 
Here later their children were born (two daughters).[1] In January 1939, the property of the Ignaz Petschek heirs in Germany was placed under receivership.[3] In the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia, however, the Nazi authorities were only able to seize the family's company assets and property after the breakup of the rest of Czechoslovakia. 
This was then done by order of the Reich Protector for Bohemia and Moravia on October 28, 1939.[4] 
Straw men acting as agents were able to transfer some of the assets and shareholdings of the Petscheks to Switzerland and the USA via Brno.[1] [2] 
However, it was noticeable in the context that at the very top of the G.B. special search list, arranged according to priority, were the brothers Karl, Ernst and Wilhelm Petschek, but Franz Petschek was completely missing from this list and was therefore not to be "recorded and seized".[1] After the war, it was possible to establish, among other things at the Flick trial, that the Nazi authorities had treated the assets of Franz and Karl Petschek in particular separately and that Franz Petschek did not appear to have been exposed to difficulties with the German tax offices.[2][3] 
Franz Petschek came from an assimilated Jewish home.[1] He was the sixth of seven children of the industrialist Ignaz Petschek and his wife Helene, née Bloch. 
The Petschek family was one of the most influential industrialists in Austria-Hungary. 
Together with his brothers Isidor and Julius, Ignaz Petschek controlled almost 50% of the lignite mining industry in Europe. 
They also owned numerous shares in banks and in the paper, glass and chemical industries. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, Ignaz Petschek parted company with his brothers and acquired considerable shareholdings, especially in the central and eastern German lignite industry, which gave him a dominant position there.[2]Ignaz Petschek's family lived in Aussig, but at times also permanently in Berlin.[3] Ignaz Petschek, in particular, retired to Aussig whenl he was very old.[4]

Volume VI. 
Besides German, Franz Petschek learned English and French. 
After the dissolution of the Danube Monarchy, Aussig was assigned to the newly founded Czechoslovakia in 1918. 
The majority of the population of Aussig saw themselves as part of the German minority. 
The Petscheks also always declared themselves as ethnic Germans in censuses. 
They cultivated the German language and culture both privately and publicly, their businesses bore German company names, and their bookkeeping and all private and business correspondence was in German. Neither the people of Aussig nor the Petscheks of Prague were supporters of Czechoslovak nationalism; they spoke and knew hardly any Czech..[1] 
At the beginning of the 1930s, the disintegration of the economic empire of the Petscheks began. 
This process had family, economic and political reasons. 
Ernst, Karl and Wilhelm Petschek had lived in Berlin since the mid-1920s, where they had permanent residences. 
Only Franz Petschek, his wife and his mother remained in Aussig.[1] 
This means that Franz Petschek no longer had a share in the family's property in Germany after his father's death. 
Ignaz Petschek's shares in German companies passed to Karl and Ernst Petschek and to a Western European consortium led by Karl Petschek. 
Franz Petschek, on the other hand, continued his father's former ventures in Czechoslovakia on his own without the participation of his brothers. Family dissonance had already arisen in 1932 during the Caro-Petschek trial. 
The driving force behind this absurd family dispute was Franz Petschek, while his brothers wanted to avoid an escalation in the interest of the family's reputation. 
The trial had a devastating effect on the reputation of the Petscheks.[1][2] 
In the course of the sale of all shares in companies of the Prague Petscheks in Central Europe, an industrial consortium consisting of Friedrich Flick KG, I.G. Farben, Wintershall Holding and Riebeck'schen Montanwerke offered the heirs of Ignaz Petschek the purchase of all their mines in Germany and Northern Bohemia in the fall of 1937. 
Ernst and Franz Petschek signaled their willingness to talk, but Karl and Wilhelm Petschek refused any sales negotiations. Hermann Göring set up a committee in January 1938 to find ways of quickly "Aryanizing" the Petschek companies..[1] 
This commission initially urged "voluntary Aryanization" and declared that expropriation and "Aryanization of commercial enterprises was not desired, but rather a 'transfer' by purchase into Aryan hands.“[1] Shares in mines owned in Germany by Ernst Petschek were not seized but "sold" to non-Jews.[2] .[3] 
Official Logo Bundesverband GEDOK 
GEDOK, founded in 1926 as the "Gemeinschaft deutscher und oesterreichischer Künstlerinnen und Kunstfreundinnen" “ [1] (Association of German and Austrian Women Artists and Friends of the Arts), is still the oldest and largest network in Europe for women artists of all artistic genres. 
Shortly after the National Socialist seizure of power, Ida Dehmel was forced to resign from the board in 1933 because of her Jewish origins and was eventually expelled from GEDOK. 
The persecutions by the National Socialist regime drove her to commit suicide in 1942. 
Of the 7000 [1] members at the time, 5000 are said to have resigned in solidarity with Ida Dehmel. 
Elsa Bruckmann (a Nazi party member) was appointed as the new chairwoman, and the women artists' association was renamed "ReichsGEDOK". 
In 1948, the federal association GEDOK was newly formed. 
The constituent first meeting took place in the house of Anna Maria Darboven on the initiative of Marianne Gärtner, the niece of Ida Dehmel, in Hamburg. 
In 2010, the "Austrian Section" dissolved itself for the time being. 
In 1990, after reunification, further regional groups were founded in the new German states, including GEDOK Brandenburg, GEDOK Mitteldeutschland in Leipzig and GEDOK Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, so that today the association with its 23 regional groups forms a functioning network. 
Board of Directors 
The headquarters of the Federal Association GEDOK e.V. is in Bonn (Haus der Kultur), where its office is also located. 
Within the board as a whole, the executive committee with representatives of the artists and art patrons consists of the president, the first deputy chairwoman, the second deputy chairwoman, the treasurer and the secretary. 
Ulrike Rosenbach, among others, served as president of GEDOK from 2012 to 2018. 
Her successor was Ursula Toyka-Fuong. 
In October 2022, Béatrice Porthoff was elected to this office. 
The association is recognized as a non-profit organization. 
The members work on a voluntary basis. 
The association draws its financial resources from contributions and donations as well as project-related grants. 
A special feature is that not only female artists of all sections, but also art-promoting members are admitted. 
Admission to the association takes place through the regional groups. 
For female artists, a university degree is desirable, but qualified self-taught artists can also apply. 
A jury of experts in the regional groups decides on the admission of female artists. 
Organisation und goal 
Der Bundesverband zählt zur Zeit mehr als 2.750 Mitglieder in 23 Regionalgruppen in Deutschland[1]. 
Der BundesverbThe national association currently has more than 2,750 members in 23 regional groups in Germany. The national association and the regional groups present female artistic work in the fields of fine arts, applied arts/art design, literature, music and interdisciplinary/performing arts to the public in order to promote female artists and to improve their particular living and working situation. 
The non-profit association is committed to the gender-appropriate design of all areas of artistic creation as well as to the equal appointment of women to committees and top positions in art and culture. 
The association is present in public through interdisciplinary art projects, exhibitions, concerts, readings, symposia, publications and catalogs. 
Through the commitment of its art-promoting members, the association supports its artistically active members ideally and financially. 
The association facilitates diverse encounters with art and women artists through exhibition and studio visits, workshop discussions, art and cultural trips. 
The work of women artists is promoted through the announcement of prizes and awards, awards, scholarships and announcements of competitions by the national association and the regional groups. 
The following prizes are awarded for outstanding works: Ida Dehmel Art Prize of GEDOK and Gabriele Vossebein for Visual Arts, GEDOK FormART Elke and Klaus Oschmann Prize for Applied Arts, Ida Dehmel Literature Prize and GEDOK Literature Promotion Prize. 
In the field of music, GEDOK e. V. promotes music through concerts and competitions. 
GEDOK e. V. participates in the awarding of the Gabriele Münter Prize for female visual artists and is the publisher of catalogs, documentations, anthologies and editions.[1] The Federal Association is involved in national and international cultural institutions, political bodies and associations and is represented, for example, in the following national and international organizations: International Society of Fine Arts, German Cultural Council, German Arts Council, German Literature Conference, German Music Council, Stiftung Kunstfonds, German Women's Council. 
GEDOK e. V. is represented in the Verwertungsgesellschaft Bild-Kunst and in the selection jury Kunst am Bau of the Federal Government. 
In the above-mentioned bodies, the federal association works on cultural policy in favor of the professional interests of women artists. 
Internally, GEDOK sees itself as a network and enables its women artists to engage in intensive exchange and collaboration - across disciplinary and regional boundaries. 
Origins 
Ida Dehmel was a member of the Werkbund and on the board of the first Zonta Club. 
It was not only here that she stood up for women's rights. 
In particular, she promoted women artists by setting up a network of committed patrons to support them. 
The grave of Eberhard Czichon and his wife Ruth at the Baumschulenweg cemetery in Berlin 
Eberhard Czichon (* August 8, 1930 in Luckenwalde; † September 8, 2020 in Berlin) was a Marxist German historian. 
When a student from Marburg cancelled her account with Deutsche Bank in March 1970, referring to Czichon's book, the branch manager responsible replied that the allegations made in it were "untrue and insulting in all essential points". 
This letter was printed in a student magazine, whereupon Czichon threatened the Marburg branch with a libel suit in which he wanted to obtain DM 5,000 from the bank "in favor of the freedom struggle of the Vietnamese people..[1] 
Trials 
Abs, who originally wanted to minimize publicity of the controversy, then sued Czichon and his publisher Manfred Pahl-Rugenstein for libel and defamation. 
On August 12, Abs and Deutsche Bank filed an action for an injunction against twenty, and later forty, of Czichon's allegations with the Regional Court in Stuttgart. 
They also demanded damages and a judicial declaration that his publications were "political tendentious writings." 
Among other things, the suit concerned Czichon's allegations that Abs had personally enriched himself in the "Aryanization" of Jewish companies, that he had been a "convinced supporter of the Hitler regime," that he had been responsible for the forced labor of concentration camp prisoners and even children, and that Abs and Deutsche Bank had plundered property from countries occupied by Germany..[1][2] The aim of the plaintiffs was to prevent a second edition of the book. 
In this, Abs and Deutsche Bank were represented by Martin Löffler; he was supported by Josef Augstein, among others, while on the side of the defendants, Friedrich Karl Kaul acted as lawyer, supported by the West German lawyer Heinrich Mackenrodt.[3] In September 1970, the Regional Court issued an injunction against the book, which Kaul appealed. 
He also filed a complaint against Abs for perjury, because Abs had made various affidavits about his behavior during the Nazi era. 
In fact, Czichon had overinterpreted his sources, namely with regard to the accusation of personal enrichment. 
However, historian Sebastian Brünger also points out that the court largely followed the traditional legal positivist narrative of the apolitical and thus innocent functionary, as if the Aryanizations had been completely normal business transactions and Abs should not have been accused of his collaboration in the racist policies of the Nazi regime..[1] 
After the trials 
Czichon submitted his Abs biography as a dissertation under the title Der Techniker der ökonomischen Aggression (The Technician of Economic Aggression), but it was dismissed as an "unscientific work of fiction" in a 1974 expert opinion by the historian Dietrich Eichholtz. 
Czichon's doctoral project thus failed again, and a further career in the GDR's scientific establishment was ruled out. 
From then on, he published nothing until the end of the GDR. 
This was attributed to the Stuttgart trial, which had done considerable damage to the reputation of GDR historical scholarship abroad. 
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Czichon explained his academic failure with a plot by the new First Secretary of the Central Committee of the SED, Erich Honecker, who would have sacrificed the historical truth allegedly represented by Czichon in the hope of obtaining Western credits.[1] 
In 1995, a revised new edition of his book Der Bankier und die Macht. 
Hermann Josef Abs in German Politics under the title Die Bank und die Macht.

In this, according to historian Lothar Gall, the "incriminated passages have been replaced by new ones and the orthodox communist 'fascism analysis' has also been partially eliminated." In his opinion, the source references "are still inaccurate, however, and in some cases simply not comprehensible, which is particularly striking when, after the end of the GDR, large holdings are now freely accessible.“[1] 
Czichon lived in Berlin until his death in September 2020.[1] 
Writings 
His 1967 book on the role of big business in the rise of the NSDAP is now considered refuted, and a publication on Hermann Josef Abs during the National Socialist era was banned by the Stuttgart Regional Court in 1972 on the grounds of false statements of fact.

Youth and professional life 
Czichon first did an apprenticeship as a wholesale merchant, then took his Abitur at a workers' and farmers' college and went on to study history. 
He then worked first as a lecturer, then in the Institute for Local History Museums at the Ministry of Culture. 
In 1948 he joined the SED, and for a short time he also worked as an unofficial employee of the Ministry for State Security. 
His solitary nature repeatedly brought him into conflict with state and party authorities. 
A doctoral project on the role of big industry in the rise of the NSDAP failed..[1] At the Academy of Sciences of the GDR, he was first employed in the Office for Academy History and, from 1970, in the Scientific Information Center.[2] 
The book Wer verhalf Hitler zur Macht? 
In 1966, he met Paul Neuhöffer in Cologne, the head of the West German Pahl-Rugenstein publishing house, who convinced him to summarize the preliminary work on his dissertation and publish it with him. 
The result was the 105-page book Who Helped Hitler to Power? in 1967. 
The historian Brünger calls the book a brochure.[1] In it, Czichon tried to explain the rise of the NSDAP with manipulations of big industry. 
Adolf Hitler had been only the "laboriously played up and expensively paid political candidate" of a "Nazi group" of industrialists, bankers and large landowners. 
Since the publications of the American historian Henry Ashby Turner, this agent theory has been disproved..[2] This work was widely received in student and trade union circles in the Federal Republic of Germany.[1] It was published in six editions until 1989. 
Discussion with Hermann Josef Abs 
Publications 
At Neuhöffer's suggestion, Czichon began researching the behavior of Deutsche Bank and its new Supervisory Board Chairman Hermann Josef Abs during the National Socialist era. 
In the archives of the German Institute for Economic Research, he found extensive files, which he began to work through after hours. 
Overwhelmed with the technical language of the financial world, he also wrote to Abs himself asking for help in understanding, but he did not reply. 
The result was a longer essay for the Blätter für deutsche und internationale Politik, published by Pahl-Rugenstein. 
For reasons of length, the text was divided into three parts, the first two of which were published in 1967. 
Upon Abs's intervention with the co-editor Viktor Renner, the third did not appear. 
Renner left the editorial board in a dispute over Czichon's essay. 
As a result, the text appeared in two different book versions. 
A shorter one was published in 1969 by Union Verlag in East Berlin under the title Hermann Josef Abs. 
The western version, published the following year by Pahl-Rugenstein, was more detailed and endeavored to provide a theoretical underpinning for the material presented. 
It was entitled Der Bankier und die Macht. 
Hermann Josef Abs in German Politics, with a foreword by the American historian George W. F. Hallgarten. 
More than a third of the text in both volumes dealt with Abs' postwar career. 
Hereby, Czichon tried to make plausible the unbroken continuity of the pernicious influence of business on politics up to the time of the Federal Republic of Germany.[1]

Self-portrait of Emma Kirchner on her business card (taken between 1863 and 1871) 
She was the first, and for over 30 years, the only professional woman photographer working in Delft and the surrounding area.[1] 
Otto-Peters lived permanently in Leipzig from 1860 and published the socially critical novel Neue Bahnen in 1864,[1] in which she addressed the problems of a working, single woman. The novel's lead character received training from an independent photographer with her own studio.[6] Whilst there is no definitive evidence of Kirchner's training or professional photograpic activity in Leipzig, she is thought to have learned the photographic craft during this time, as well as the basic knowledge of running a business.[7] When Kirchner moved to the Netherlands, she declared her profession as a photographer upon arrival, and opened her photo studio shortly after.[7] 
Living and working in the Netherlands 
In 1860, Kirchner's sister Maria married the gunmaker and blacksmith Frederik Gräfe from Delft and moved to the city. 
On 6 November 1863, Emma Kirchner and her mother also moved to Delft. 
They lived at Wijk 1, No. 179 (today Vijverstraat 11). 
Kirchner registered as a photographer with the Delft Wijkmeester (the official responsible for a district). 
Before the end of the year, she and her brother-in-law Frederik Gräfe opened a photographic studio under the name E. Kirchner & Co in the Zuiderstraat, which ran parallel to the street she lived in.[1] The business cards for their studio show different house numbers and, for a short time, her residential address. 
Historian Petra Notenboom concluded from her research that this occurred through several periods of alterations to the studio.[1] 
In September 1871, Kirchner and Gräfe parted as business partners. 
In 1875 Kirchner entered into a new business partnership with Henri de Louw (full name Johannes Hendricus Jacobus de Louw), who married her daughter Doris in July of that year. She had employed him as an apprentice about three years earlier. 
From then on the studio advertised vitreous enamel portraits and the enlarging of visiting cards. 
In 1876 the younger couple moved into their own flat and had their first child. 
After about a year of working together under the name Henri de Louw en Emma Kirchner, the business partners separated and de Louw opened his own photography studio at the Koornmarkt in Delft.[1] 
Kirchner's mother died in 1878, and her sister Maria in 1883. 
Kirchner continued to run her own studio until May 1899, when she retired at 69 years old. 
From 1863 until the end of her working life, she had been the only female professional photographer in Delft and the surrounding area. 
She sold her studio to Johannes van Doorne.[1] He had been trained by Gräfe and was employed by Kirchner as an assistant from 1890.[2] 
After retiring, Kirchner first moved to The Hague, where her daughter Doris's family now lived. 
After her daughter's divorce in 1901, she moved with her to Amsterdam.

Early life and education in Leipzig 
Further reading 
Johanna Frederika Doris Emma Kirchner was born in Leipzig on 30 March 1830, the eldest daughter of Johanna Frederika Fritzsche and Carl Pancras Kirchner, a tailor. 
Three years later, her sister Maria Amalia Louisa was born but her father died just four months later. 
Her mother continued to run the family tailor's shop. 
In 1841 the family moved into a house at 7 Neukirchhof in the centre of Leipzig (destroyed in the Second World War, and now called Matthäikirchhof). 
Not far from there, her mother opened a new tailor's shop at 24 Große Fleischergasse.[1] 
The father was the Leipzig publisher and bookseller Rudolph Löes but they did not marry. 
Her sister Maria had also given birth to a daughter, Emma, a few days earlier.[1] 
Emma Kirchner age c. 25 (in 1855). 
Photographer: Bertha Wehnert-Beckmann 
Due to the location of her home and her mother's place of work in Leipzig, the local early photographic studios are thought to have been a familiar sight to and influence on Emma Kirchner. 
There is evidence of its use in Leipzig that year[1] and of printed instructions for taking photographs using the daguerreotype being published in the city.[2] 
There was a photographic studio in the Große Fleischergasse, the street where Kirchner's mother ran her tailor's shop.[1] Not far away at Burgstraße 8, Europe's first professional woman photographer, Bertha Wehnert-Beckmann, like Kirchner the daughter of a tailor, ran her photographic studio. 
Beckmann had previously worked in Dresden and travelled as a self employed photographer, opening her studio in 1843 with daguerreotypist Eduard Wehnert who she then married. By 1847 Wehnert-Beckmann was widowed and ran her Leipzig studio with employees. 
From 1849 to 1851 she worked in New York in her own successful photo studio on Broadway, then on her return to Leipzig, she bought a property in a good residential area and had a house with a studio built.[2] Researchers assume that Emma Kirchner received her training as a photographer from Wehnert-Beckmann, but there is no definitive evidence for this.[1][3]

Ancestry and education 
Takeover of Kölnischen Volkszeitung 
In 1941, the Reich Propaganda Ministry banned the centrist Kölnische Volkszeitung, a Catholic newspaper published by the Christian publishing house J. Bachem for 80 years. 
It was a direct competitor to DuMont's Kölnische Zeitung. 
Its editor Reinhold Heinen was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp for four years because of his conservative activities critical of the state. 
Kurt Neven DuMont took over the subscriber base of the Kölnische Volkszeitung at a price of 23 Reichsmarks per customer. 
Thanks to good connections with the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW), the publishing house M. DuMont Schauberg also benefited from Wehrmacht welfare: The Kölnische Zeitung was obtained by the propaganda department of the OKW and sent to German soldiers on the front. 
In the summer of 1944, Neven DuMont was awarded the 1st Class Cross of War Merit with Swords by the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, which honored special services under enemy fire or in military warfare. 
Kurt Neven DuMont kept a number of journalists critical of the regime, such as August Dresbach, Fritz Hauenstein and Gert H. Theunissen, on the editorial staff of the Kölnische Zeitung and employed a female employee of Jewish descent as a secretary until the last years of the war. 
Postwar 
After the end of World War II, DuMont's papers were banned, as were all newspapers that had published during the Nazi regime. 
Even later, the Kölnische Zeitung was not granted a license by the British occupying power. 
After the founding of the Federal Republic in 1949, only the previous local Cologne edition, the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, was revived by the DuMont publishing house. 
For reasons of tradition, this has had the subtitle Kölnische Zeitung since 1962. 
The publishing house is also said to have used political prisoners to repair war damage on the premises. 
As late as 1947, the city of Cologne had to issue a reminder for the payment of back wages for such work assignments. 
The publishing house rejected claims that Kurt Neven DuMont and his wife had benefited privately and commercially from the Aryanization of Jewish assets: the purchase of the land and real estate in question in prime locations in Cologne between 1938 and 1941 had been carried out at market value and was not directly connected with the emigration or deportation of the former Jewish owners..[1]

New beginnings after WWII 
Immediately after the end of the war, various Cologne newspapers received the press license they needed to resume publication. 
In addition to the communist Volksstimme and the social democratic-oriented Rheinische Zeitung (licensees: Hans Böckler and others), the CDU-affiliated Kölnische Rundschau (licensees: Reinhold Heinen and others) was launched as the successor to the Kölnische Volkszeitung. 
Only Kurt Neven DuMont was denied the corresponding license by the military government because he was considered politically incriminated.
