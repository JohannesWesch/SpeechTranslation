It was only after the abolition of the licensing requirement for daily newspapers with the founding of the Federal Republic that Neven DuMont was able to publish the first edition of the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger after World War II on October 29, 1949. 
On his father's side, Kurt Neven DuMont came from the family of Mathieu Neven (1796-1878), who had immigrated from Liège in the eighteenth century and initially achieved great prosperity in tobacco manufacturing. 
The subject of Kurt Neven DuMont's dissertation was German reparation payments after the First World War. 
Succession 
In September 1953, Kurt Neven DuMont's son, Alfred Neven DuMont, joined the publishing house M. DuMont-Schauberg, where he was initially the journalistic director of the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger from 1955. 
In 1960, he switched to the publishing side and, together with Ernst Brücher, a son-in-law of Kurt Neven DuMont, and Dieter Schütte, August Neven DuMont's son-in-law, became personally liable partners of the M. DuMont-Schauberg company. 
Kurt Neven DuMont was married to Gabriele DuMont, née von Lenbach, daughter of the painter Franz von Lenbach, and had four children. 
Neven DuMont died on July 6, 1967, at the age of 65 in the University Hospital in Munich. 
His gravesite is at the Holzhausen cemetery on Lake Starnberg.[1] The successor as sole editor of the press products published by the publishing house was his son Alfred Neven DuMont. 
Since 1976, the West German Academy for Communication has awarded an annual Dr. Kurt Neven DuMont Medal, donated by Alfred Neven DuMont, "for special services to advertising."

Professional career 
Footnotes 
Neven DuMont joined the management of his parents' publishing company and large printing house M. DuMont Schauberg on January 1, 1927, after completing a lengthy period of training at a major Berlin publishing house. 
Journalism in the Nazi era Kurt Neven DuMont joined the Nazi Pary on May 1, 1937. The publisher's biographer Manfred Pohl sees three developmental phases in Kurt Neven DuMont's attitude to National Socialism - from the critical to the undecided to the conformist spirit.[1] In 1933 in particular, the publishing house had to hold its own against takeover attempts by the Westdeutscher Beobachter - the Rhineland offshoot of the NSDAP organ Völkischer Beobachter - which was waging a campaign against the established rival papers in Cologne by dumping prices, calling on advertisers to boycott the paper and attempting to intimidate subscribers. 
Kurt Neven DuMont succeeded in securing the existence of his publishing house until the end of the war, not least because his then internationally renowned Kölnische Zeitung was under the direct supervision of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda and, as a journalistic fig leaf vis-à-vis foreign countries, was intended to maintain the appearance of a free press in the Third Reich. 
Weeks before the Nazis came to power in 1933, Neven Dumont adhered to the Nazi line - earlier than other publishers. [1] . 
In its New Year's issue of January 1, 1933, the Kölnische Illustrierte Zeitung printed a euphoric article about fascist youth education in Italy,[2] the Kölnische Zeitung headlined on the same day: "It all depends on Hitler!" and predicted: "The year 1933 confronts Hitler with the decision whether he wants to remain at the gates of politics as an idolized leader and perhaps also as a martyr of a religious community, or whether he is prepared to bear the responsibility of throwing the positive forces of his movement into the scales of practical politics. 
In the interest of national consolidation, one would hope that Hitler would find the second way." 
In its issue of November 11, 1933, the Kölnische Illustrierte Zeitung interfered directly in the Reichstag election, a mock election with an NSDAP unified list coupled with a referendum, by suggestively transforming the front page into a ballot paper. 
In the background of the picture montage, masses of people can be seen raising their hands in the Hitler salute. 
The publisher also embraced the National Socialists' ideas on "degenerate art" at an early stage by showing a bicycle deliberately overloaded with SS symbols by the artist on the cover of the illustrated magazine on July 1, 1933, and referring to the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur in Cologne, which wanted to "combat precisely such tastelessness" with a current exhibition. 
The front page, dated June 13, 1940, showed "victorious German soldiers" and a photo of a captured African colonial soldier. 
The caption read, "With this scum of humanity, the French wanted to conquer German cultural land in 1940, too." On the tenth anniversary of the seizure of power in 1943, the Kölnische Illustrierte Zeitung honored Adolf Hitler as the "creator of the Greater German Reich" with his likeness on the cover. 
Alfred Neven DuMont was a son of the publisher August Neven DuMont. 
After studying law in Geneva and Strasbourg, he was trained in the printing trade at the Vienna Hof- und Staatsdruckerei in 1890. 
He then worked at the Reichsdruckerei Berlin and a paper shop in Cologne. 
In 1892, he joined the publishing house M. DuMont Schauberg, which was run by his father, and managed the printing plant there. 
In 1895, he became an authorized signatory. 
When his father died the following year, Alfred Neven DuMont took over the management of the publishing house as a full partner together with his older brother Josef Neven DuMont. 
In 1915, he became senior partner of the company and managed it together with his nephew August Neven DuMont. 
He published the "Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger" and, from 1926, the "Kölnische Illustrierte Zeitung". 
He was also a commercial judge, Vice Chairman of the Association of German Newspaper Publishers (VDZV) and a member of the Board of the Association of Rhenish Newspaper Publishers.

He was married to the women's rights activist Alice Minderop (1877-1964). 
Alfred Neven DuMont was buried in the family grave at Melaten Cemetery in Cologne (Parcel 63a).

The Reich Chamber of Fine Arts (Reichskunstkammer for short) was an institution in the "Third Reich" that had the task of promoting fine art that corresponded to the sentiments of the time, but also of suppressing directions that contradicted them. 
German art" in the sense of National Socialism was contrasted with "degenerate art". 
In this way, the Reichskunstkammer contributed to the Gleichschaltung of culture and society during the period of National Socialism. 
Only members could exhibit in the German Reich and practice art as a profession. 
Artists with a Jewish or Communist background were not allowed to exhibit or were excluded. 
If they could not leave Germany in time, they were murdered or executed in the Holocaust (Oda Schottmüller, Cato Bontjes van Beek). 
Functions 
Structure 
The Reich Chamber of Fine Arts was divided into the following professional associations:[1] 
The Reich Chamber of Fine Arts had its headquarters in what was then Berlin W 35, Blumeshof 4-6 (today the Tiergarten district). 
Throughout the Reich, it was divided into 31 regional sections, which were led by so-called Landesleitungen and their "Landesleiters". 
The regional leaders included 
Impact 
Like all other Reich chambers, the organization saw itself as the professional representative body of all artists belonging to it. 
All full-time members belonged to it, as far as they were assigned to the professional associations of the occupational groups. 
Membership in the Reich Chamber of Culture was mandatory for all German artists. 
This institution was a state authority that acted authoritatively in the sense of the Nazi dictatorship. 
All previous professional organizations (including all independent artists' groups and associations) were dissolved or forcibly transferred to the Reich Chamber of Culture. 
Persons without proof of Aryan origin were gradually excluded. 
In addition, artists whose works represented system-critical content and/or "degenerate art" were excluded and banned from painting and exhibiting. 
The corresponding determinations were made by relevant Gaukammer committees. 
These usually made their decisions after field observations by party-linked art commissioners at exhibitions, in the art trade, or by private denunciation. 
Anonymous denunciations were the order of the day and were feared by all artists whose works did not correspond to popular taste. 
New admissions to the Reichskulturkammer were made exclusively on application. 
In 1936/37, the organizational Gleichschaltung of art under National Socialism in the sense of a "National Socialist-influenced popular culture" was largely complete. 
From then on, only those who were registered as members of the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts received state funding, public commissions, and exhibition opportunities in the German art trade. 
Ultimately, the systematic withdrawal of the economic basis meant a professional ban for all unorganized artists. 
In the biographies of almost all full-time artists active at the time, obligatory membership in the Reich Chamber of Culture (and its subgroups) is concealed. 
In fact, mere membership does not yet justify the suspicion that the artist was an active supporter and advocate of National Socialist ideas. 
With the outlawing of all "folk-subverting" art movements and all artists who were in any way connected with Judaism, the professional artists as members of the Reichskunstkammer were faced with a review of the content and style of their artistic work and, if necessary, also with readjustments or new adjustments. 
Each had to find his own answer to this. 
Thus, some went into inner emigration and strove for innocuous subjects such as portraits, still lifes, landscape painting or an apolitical naturalism. 
A few artists continued to stand by their art and their own style of artistic expression. 
If their art was denounced as degenerate, they fled into exile. 
Others renounced German art and the organized art business and took up another profession. 
The German artists of Jewish origin were persecuted, had to flee or were murdered in the Holocaust..

The Reich Chamber of Art or Reich Chamber of Fine Arts was founded by the Ministry of Propaganda on November 1, 1933 as one of seven departments of the Reich Chamber of Culture. 
Its purpose, as veiledly defined by Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, was to consist of 
In fact, it functioned not only as a non-profit professional organization, but also as an organ of control and so-called Gleichschaltung of artists by the Nazi regime. 
In 2015, art historian Nina Kubowitsch came to the following conclusion based on her research into the activities of the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts: "The mass of tens of thousands of artists in Germany was very heterogeneous; there were not only the persecuted and 'degenerate' artists on the one hand and the 'Nazi artists' on the other. 
The actual mass of artists and cultural workers in Germany lay between these two poles. 
Their fates must also be considered when examining the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts, for they formed the actual membership base." The Chamber was not to be limited unilaterally to its function as a mere controlling body or as a mere representation of artists' interests.[1] 
To be admitted to exhibitions, membership in the Reichskunstkammer was essential. 
Some artists were rejected or excluded "if there were facts that the person in question did not possess the reliability and aptitude required for the exercise of his activity“.[1] 
The presidential councils of the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts included Albert Speer, Hans Herbert Schweitzer, Hans Weidemann, Otto von Kursell, Franz Lenk (1933 to 1936), Richard Klein, and Hans-Peter Meister. 
The first president from 1933 to 1936 was the architect Eugen Hönig. 
His successor until 1943 was Adolf Ziegler, who had been well acquainted with Hitler since 1925 and was for many years in charge of fine arts in the NSDAP. 
He was followed by Wilhelm Kreis from 1943 to 1945. 
1941 Arno Breker was named Vice president 
With the Control Council Law No. 2 of October 10, 1945, the Reich Chamber of Culture and consequently also its subdivision Reich Chamber of Fine Arts was banned by the Allied Control Council and its property confiscated.

Jewish collectors in Wroclaw existed in the Weimar Republic until the National Socialists came to power. 
They played "the most important role[1] in the art scene because it was they who began to bring the first modernist works to the Silesian capital for exhibition. 
Jewish collectors from Wroclaw were particularly interested in the masterpieces presented by the leading galleries in Berlin and Paris, which, according to Marius Winzeler, made them one of the "great collector[s] of Germany".[2] In 1923, Karl Scheffler paid detailed tribute to the Jewish Breslau collections and emphasized their importance for Germany:[3] 
Heinz Braune, who was director of the Silesian Museum of Fine Arts in Wroclaw from 1919 to 1928, knew how to interest Jewish art collectors living in Wroclaw in the museum. 
Several Jewish collectors in Breslau supported Braune with donations, such as the then Breslau city theater director Dr. Theodor Loewe with a second version of Bendemann's "Mourning Jews" and a female figure by Robert Bednorz. 
Important Jewish collectors and philanthrophists in Breslau 
Małgorzata Stolarska-Fronia mentions five Jewish collectors in Wroclaw: 
Marius Winzeler also names Toni and Albert Neisser, Max Pinkus, and Otto Ollendorff as "protagonists of Jewish collectorship and patronage in Breslau".[1] 
Ramona Bräu also mentions the Jewish Breslau collectors Schottländer, David Friedmann and Öttinger..[1] 
According to Winzeler, the list of Jewish art collections and collectors of Jewish origin remains incomplete.[1] 
Małgorzata Stolarska-Fronia also emphasizes the value of Jewish collectors: "Jewish art collectors became the predominant promoters of new trends in art." Jewish collectors were Ismar Littmann, Carl Sachs, Max Silberberg, Schottländer, David Friedmann, Leo Smoschewer, Emil Kaim, Hugo Kolker, Leo Lewin as well as Öttinger.“[1] 
Type of collectors and philanthropists 
In the case of the Neisser couple, the creation of Villa Neisser as a "cultural center[...]"' was at the center of their activities, as well as the "establishment of a cultural memorial"..[1] However, this was not the case for the collectors Lewin, Sachs and Silberberg. 
For them, the private enjoyment of art and the collecting of artworks by leading contemporary artists represented a balance to their work. 
The selection of artworks was an expression of their "self-image as modern cosmopolitans.[2] They were particularly interested in the masterpieces presented by the leading galleries in Berlin and Paris. 
Thus they ranked themselves among the "great collectors of Germany"[2] Karl Scheffler paid detailed tribute to the three collections (Lewin, Sachs, and Silberberg) in 1923, saying.: 
Nazi era and its impact on the Jewish collectors 
When the Nazis come to power, the cultural sector implemented anti-semitic laws. 
Jewish art collectors were forced fro their positions, plundered and murdered. Erich Wiese - Heinz Braune's successor as museum director - was a representative of modern art and was therefore dismissed by the National Socialists on June 23, 1933. 
After Jewish businesses were aryanized and many were also banned from their professions, the Jewish middle class lost its livelihood and Jewish art patrons were deported, had to emigrate or died shortly afterwards. 
Max Silberberg was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942 and later to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he perished. 
Aryanisation of Jewish art collections 
After the Jewish art collectors had died, been deported or emigrated, the "recovery" of the remaining and confiscated Jewish art collections could now begin.“[1]Cornelius Müller-Hofstede and his colleague Sigfried Asche were active as recyclers of Jewish art assets. 
They wanted to add Jewish collections to the two most important Silesian museums in Breslau and Görlitz. 
The employees of the Museum of Fine Arts in Wroclaw sifted through the Sachs, Silberberg and Smoschewer collections for art possessions of interest to the museum and drew up an overview of the pieces to be considered, and prepared a list with a total of 84 works of art from the Sachs, Silberberg and Schmoschewer collections.[2] 
In 1935, Leo Lewin was forced by political and economic constraints to sell his collection to Max Perl in Berlin.[1][2] 
In addition to the Jewish collections of Friedmann and Sachs, Silberberg's collection was of "special interest" to museums and the city government.[1] On January 30, 1940, Silberberg was forced to hand over his immense art treasure to the Breslau-Süd tax office, because he had previously been accused of tax evasion after declaring the assets of his works of art. 
In addition, he had to hand over all sales proceeds to the local tax office. 
After the Silberberg collection had been taxed by the Breslau-Süd tax office, the Breslau district president asked the Breslau-Süd tax office in a letter dated February 1, 1940 to wait with the disposal until Dr. Barthel or Dr. Gindel of the Museum of Decorative Arts and Antiquities had been given the opportunity to comment. 
At that time, a large part of Silberberg's art treasure was in storage at the Museum of Fine Arts in Wroclaw. 
Many others were still interested in the immense Jewish art treasure and - "the race for the most valuable pieces began". The Aryanization Commissioner, Regierungsrat von Natzmer, expressed his desire to purchase a small bronze from the Jewish art collection to the museum director, Müller-Hofstede. 
The museum then waived its right of first refusal and handed over the valuable sculpture from Jewish ownership to the Aryanization Commissioner. 
On July 5, 1941, Müller-Hofstede attempted in a letter to the Breslau government to allocate the more valuable part of the Jewish art treasure to the Breslau Museum of Fine Arts free of charge. 
However, the Chief Finance President of Lower Silesia successfully objected to this on March 26, 1942 to the Breslau Government President. 
Wilhelm Perlhöfter's collection "often enough attracted the visit of museum directors and art dealers".[1] 
The family approached Professor Hertel (head of the Kunstkammer for Silesia) as part of the household liquidation and hoped to obtain an export license for the art collection. 
Helene Perlhöfter knew to report that "Professor Hertel [was] a glass expert himself and [knew] our collection exactly. 
He demanded that the museum directors first be given the opportunity to select suitable pieces from the collection. 
The museum directors then came to us and selected a number of pieces that interested them. 
For all the rest we received [...] a certificate that it was not of interest for German cultural purposes".[1] 
The Perlhöfters were expatriated on July 16, 1941, and their assets fell to the Reich. 
The family's lifts were confiscated by the Bremen Gestapo and part of the removal goods, as well as the art collection, were auctioned off. 
The auction proceeds in the amount of 9,421.92 Reichsmark were later transferred by the Bremen-Ost Finanzkasse to the Oberfinanzkasse Breslau. 
Whereabouts of the art collections and restitution to heirs in the post-war period (from 1945) 
Today's National Museum in Wrocław ([Muzeum Narodowe we Wrocławiu] has hardly any evidence left, which reminds of the donations and the "Jewish patronage of the interwar period.“[1] [2] 
Thus, the Wroclaw art collections were transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw in the post-war period. 
Also much from the donations to the Wroclaw Museum of Fine Arts from the interwar period can be found today in the National Museum in Warsaw. 
In the depots of the Warsaw Museum are stored works that were taken over by Müller Hofstede from the expropriated remaining collections Kaim, Sachs, Silberberg and Schmoschewer. 
In countless museums and private collections in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Israel and the USA, works were found that had formerly belonged to "Jewish Breslau collectors" and had been taken away from them.[1] 
Jewish art collectors and philanthropists in Breslau 
Individual works from the Sachs, Silberberg, Smoschever and Littmann collections were restituted. 
The Municipal Collections in Görlitz restituted seven works of art to the heirs of the former owners Sachs, Smoschever and Ollendorff (Woman with Lilies in a Greenhouse). 
In addition, three objects that had belonged to Max Pinkus. 
The remaining paintings, sculptures and works of fine art, which were proven to be Jewish property, had not been returned in the post-war period from their storage locations, which had become Polish in the meantime. 
Together with the rest of the items that had been removed from storage - 80% of the collection in Görlitz had been removed from storage - they had been taken by the Polish authorities to other collection centers. 
The most important Jewish art objects from Breslau thus ended up in state museums in Warsaw, Krakow and others. 
Other paintings later appeared in the art trade and changed owners. 
For example, in the 1990s the painting from the Carl Sachs Collection, the female portrait created by Wilhelm Trübner in 1874 was offered in a Berlin gallery. 
In various cases, restitution has also already been disputed.[1] 
Die Beziehungen zwischen Juden, Protestanten und Katholiken in einer deutschen Großstadt von 1860 bis 1925 (= Kritische Studien zur Geschichtswissenschaft. 
First, Winzeler explains Jewish patronage and collectorship in general terms. 
Early on, Breslau counted "an astonishing number of representatives of the up-and-coming Jewish bourgeoisie"[1] in the Wroclaw art and cultural scene, such as the "Silesian Society for Patriotic Culture," in which Jewish members had held "prominent positions" since the 1850s.[1] . 
The Society was also instrumental in the establishment of the Wroclaw Museum of Fine Arts.[2][3] 
In the past 300 years, the share of the upper middle class among the Jews had developed far more strongly than among the rest of the population, according to Till van Rahden.[1] Werner Sombart describes that in 1905 Wroclaw's Jews were so enterprising that they alone could pay four times as much in taxes as the rest of the population. 
Marius Winzeler also explains that Wroclaw's Jewish merchants were so successful that they were able to contribute an "above-average share" of Wroclaw's municipal tax revenue.[2] 
The Jewish art collections entered the public museums of Wroclaw through municipal purchases and private donations.[3] [4] 
From 1920 onwards, representatives of the upper Jewish bourgeoisie can be found in prominent positions in many associations and boards of trustees. 
Since 1921 there was the "Society of Friends of Art", which focused its interest especially on contemporary and modern art. 
Life and work 
Walter Feilchenfeldt was born in Berlin on January 21, 1894, the son of a doctor. 
Amsterdam and Zürich 
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Feilchenfeldt was persecuted due to his Jewish heritage. 
Their first son Walter Feilchenfedlt Jr was born in 1939. 
His business partner Grete Ring dissolved in 1937 the Berlin branch of Cassiser and founded in London a British company, Kunsthandlung Paul Cassirer Limited. 
Feilchenfeldt moved to Switzerland with his family and worked as an art dealer lin Ascona and Zürich. 
The art dealership was then directed by his widow, Marianne Breslauer-Feilchenfeldt, until 1990. 
She was joined in 1966 by their son Walter Feilchenfeldt Jr who later managed the business until 2011. 
Feilchenfeldt Jr was also the director of Kunstvermittlung AG in Zürich. 
Hans Kroch (full name Hans Meyer Zwi Kroch) (* June 3, 1887 in Leipzig; † February 7, 1970 in Jerusalem) was a German-Jewish banker. 
The Israel Museum. 
Kroch attended the König-Albert-Gymnasium in Leipzig. In 1922 he joined Privatbank Kroch jr. 
In 1923, he was a founding and supervisory board member of Leipziger Messe- und Ausstellungs-AG. 
In 1928, Bankhaus Kroch moved into the Kroch high-rise building on Augustusplatz, designed by the architect German Bestelmeyer. 
At 43 meters high, it was Leipzig's first high-rise building. 
In addition, as the main shareholder of AG für Haus- und Grundbesitz, Kroch financed the construction of the Krochsiedlung in Leipzig-Gohlis in 1929-1930, which was soon popularly named after him, a residential complex of early social housing in the style of classical modernism. 
In the course of the "Aryanization" of German companies by the National Socialists, Kroch was arrested on November 10, 1938, after the Pogrom Night and deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp, later Sachsenhausen. 
Only after he had submitted a waiver of the corporate assets of Bankhaus Kroch on behalf of all family members was he released and the bank finally taken over by Industrie- und Handelsbank AG. 
Kroch managed to escape to Amsterdam together with his children, later he emigrated to Argentina and finally to Israel, where he built the hotel complex Eretz Hatzvi ("Hirschland", later renamed Holyland) in the Jerusalem suburb Bayit veGan.[1] His wife Ella Kroch, née Baruch (* 16 July 1896 in Karlsruhe, d. 
12 May 1942 in Ravensbrück), who initially stayed behind to conceal the escape, was however arrested during her own escape. 
She was deported to Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1940 and murdered there two years later. 
The son Jacob fell in 1948 in the Israeli War of Independence during the battle for Kibbutz Nitzanim. 
In his memory, Hans Kroch donated the Holyland model to the city of Jerusalem. 
It has been on the campus of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem since 2006.[1] 
Cornelius Müller Hofstede (photo 1963) 
Publications (Selection) 
Cornelius Müller Hofstede was born the son of the priest Müller. 
His mother was a sister of the Dutch scholar Cornelis Hofstede de Groot (1863-1930). 
One of his sons was the art historian Justus Müller Hofstede (1929-2015). 
He passed his school-leaving examination in Weimar in 1918. 
Even at that time he worked for a time with his uncle Hofstede de Groot in The Hague. 
In the following years he published several studies on Dutch Baroque painting, which show him to be an excellent connoisseur of this period. 
After a period as a trainee at the Bavarian National Museum in Munich and at the State Museums in Berlin under Wilhelm von Bode, he took up a position as assistant and senior assistant at the Art History Seminar of the Berlin University under Adolph Goldschmidt and Albert Erich Brinckmann from 1927 to 1934. 
He subsequently chose the name Müller Hofstede to avoid confusion with colleagues. 
In 1934, he decided to enter the museum service and took a provisional position at the Silesian Museum of Fine Arts in Wroclaw, and two years later he was appointed as the Executive Director. 
During his tenure, several interesting exhibitions should be noted, which, in addition to 16th century Silesian painting, were particularly devoted to 19th century German painting, including Caspar David Friedrich, Carl Blechen and Adolph Menzel. 
The Wroclaw Museum, as a central state cultural institute, was also concerned with the care and registration of private art collections in Silesia and acquired knowledge that the National Socialist dictatorship intended to use in order to gain foreign currency and prepare for war. 
Here, it was primarily a matter of Jewish art ownership, for the value-relevant and material safeguarding of which Müller Hofstede was responsible as director. 
In this respect, as far as the relevant files allow a judgment, he "decisively and actively promoted the exploitation of former Jewish art possessions".“[1] Müller Hofstede's activity in Breslau ended in 1944 when he was called up for military service. 
The Braunschweig collections owe numerous studies to his scholarly activity, which were primarily concerned with the paintings of Rembrandt and his circle. 
He also published important results on the determination of Giorgione's famous self-portrait. 
The culmination of his professional career began with his appointment in 1957 as director of the Gemäldegalerie der Ehemals Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, which at that time was located in Berlin-Dahlem as a result of the division of the city. 
The return to the German capital and to the beginnings of his education also meant a challenge for the goals of his research, which were now primarily focused on Rembrandt. 
The genesis and reconstruction of Rembrandt's painting "The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis" in the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm formed a special focus. 
Müller Hofstede was a member of the Historical Commission for Silesia.[1] From 1961 to 1970 he was chairman of the Kunstgeschichtliche Gesellschaft zu Berlin. 
The Sokoliv Kamin (also: Devil's Stone, Sokol Kamin, Sokil Kamin) is a natural geological monument in Ukraine. 
It consists of a rock formation. 
It is located south of the village of Spas (Sambir Raion, Lviv Oblast) on a wooded hill near the Dniester River. 
The area of the protected area is 5.5 hectares, and the status has existed since 1984 (under the name "Rock 'Sokoliv Kamin' - the remnant of the Yamnenska Sandstones"). 
The status was granted to preserve an interesting geological object, the remains of the Yamnenska Sandstone. 
The rocks were formed by the separation of relatively hard sandstones from soft rock layers as a result of erosion (destruction of rock by wind, water, temperature changes). 
The Sokoliv Kamin is actually not made of a single stone, but of three remaining stones, the highest of which is 24 metres high. 
Legend about the "Devil's Stone" 
According to legend, friendly and peaceful people once lived there, always helping each other. 
Monks from a nearby monastery also contributed to this. 
Of course, the devil did not like that and decided to destroy the monastery and the village by giving it a devilish name: Spas. 
To this end, the devil found a stone in a distant land and carried it to the village of Spas. 
That night, a monk in the monastery had a prophetic dream, and he began to pray fervently to avert the disaster. 
It helped: when the devil was near the village, it dawned and the cocks began to sing. 
The devil, who had lost his powers, threw a stone and fled far into the Carpathians. 
Since then, the stone has stood at the edge of the village of Spas. 
Elisabeth and Marianne Leisching were her cousins. 
Ilse Bernheimer studied with Franz Strohofer from 1906.

Laurentina is the first beer brand and former brewery from Mozambique. 
It was founded in 1932 and since 2002 has been a brand of the Mozambican brewing group Cervejas de Moçambique, itself an Anheuser-Busch InBev subsidiary. 
Laurentina has a share of around 20% of the Mozambique beer market.[1][2] 
Laurentina is also available in some supermarkets in Portugal, but with no connection to Mozambique, and no significant market presence. 
A Portuguese who left Mozambique during the colonial war in Mozambique re-registered the brand in Germany after the Carnation Revolution and has since been producing Laurentina beer for Portugal.[1][2] 
Polemic around advertising campaign 2011 
An advertising campaign for the dark beer Laurentina Preta caused a stir in 2011. 
A stylized black woman's body was shown with a label of the beer and accompanied by an ambiguous slogan, which on the one hand was aimed at the improved dark beer (Cerveja preta - "black beer"), but on the other hand could be interpreted as an allusion to the availability of a black woman reduced to a sex object (original: Esta preta foi de boa para melhor - Agora com uma garrafa mais sexy., English roughly: "This black one is now available even better - Now with an even more seductive bottle. ").[1][2] 
After public protest and increasing international attention, in the Portuguese-speaking community and among international visitors to the 2011 African Games in Maputo, the CDM withdrew its advertising.[1][2][3]

A bottle of light Laurentina (Clara), enjoyed near the beach of Vilankulo. 
In the then Portuguese colony of Mozambique, the Greek immigrant Cretikos founded the Victoria Ice and Water Factory in 1916 as the first ice and mineral water factory in Mozambique. 
He subsequently expanded production to include soft drinks and also aimed to produce the first Mozambican beer. 
To this end, he traveled to Germany and hired a master brewer. 
According to his recipe, the production of the new beer began in 1932, which Cretikos named Laurentina, after the popular name for the inhabitants of his city, Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) - " laurentinos". 
The brewery later became the Fábrica de Cerveja Reunidas.[1][2][3] 
Laurentina became the best-selling beer in Mozambique and also sold in neighboring South Africa. 
It did not face serious domestic competition until 1962, when it was joined by the beer brand 2M, today the undisputed market leader. 
Manica from Beira, which had already been founded in 1959, was only regionally significant and had hardly any presence in the capital.[1][2][3] 
After Mozambique's independence in 1975, Laurentina sales declined extremely. 
The reason was the country's economic situation: in 1977, the Mozambican Civil War had broken out, and the planned economic restructuring was also not making any progress. 
Some important ingredients were now almost impossible to obtain. 
Laurentina beer, however, was produced continuously, despite the only slowly decreasing difficulties, even if the at times very low production could not nearly meet the demand of the capital alone..[1] 
After the end of the People's Republic of Mozambique in 1990 and the subsequent market-economy restructuring of the economy, Laurentina was then privatized in 1995 and sold to the French BGI/Groupe Castel.[1] 
In 2002, Castel sold Laurentina to Cervejas de Moçambique (CDM). 
The latter is 49.1% owned by the SABMiller Group (now AB InBev), which also manages the company. 
CDM also owns the other Mozambican beer brands, such as the market leader 2M, the likewise traditional Manica beer, and Impala, the world's first industrially produced beer made from cassava, which was launched in 2012.[1][2] 
International presence 
Since 2006, CDM began to export Laurentina again in a targeted manner. 
Alongside South Africa, Great Britain is the most important target country. 
However, exports represent only a small part of sales so far.[1][2] 
Cervejas de Moçambique (CDM) is a brewery group from Mozambique. 
It has its headquarters, in the capital Maputo.

The following Mozambican brands belong to CDM: 
In addition, it brews under license beers of other brands, in particular: 
Castle Lite Chibuku 
Further information 
CDM maintains a wine trade and distributes a range of spirits. 
In addition to its four production facilities, it has seven wholesale sales outlets in the country..[1] 
CDM is part of the AB InBev brewing group and owns all the major Mozambican beer brands. 
It thus holds over 90% market share in the country.[1] [2]It brews over 2 million hectoliters of beer annually at its four production sites in Maputo (two), Beira, and Nampula.[2] 
The company was founded in 1995, after the end of the People's Republic of Mozambique (1990) and the subsequent transformation to a market economy. 
The South African-US group SABMiller took over 49.1% and the management of the company. 
This was followed by modernizations to the facilities in Maputo and the construction of a new modern brewery in Nampula, in the north of the country, by the German company Krones in 2009.[2] 
In 2012, CDM introduced Impala beer, the world's first industrially produced beer made from cassava. 
This was intended to support the country's agriculture and reduce import dependency, as well as bringing a cheaper beer to the market. 
For production in Nampula, purchases are primarily made from regional smallholders, who until then had faced production surpluses that could not be sold. 
In 2015, about 7,500 family farms in the region supplied cassava to Impala.[1][2]

He was director of the Kunstmuseum Basel from 1939 to 1961. 
Georg Schmidt was born the son of Carl Schmidt, professor of geology at the University of Basel, and his wife Charlotte Hudtwalker, who came from Hamburg.[1] He was a younger brother of the architect Hans Schmidt. 
Already during his studies Schmidt was an art critic for the Basler Vorwärts. 
Later he remained a committed socialist and was at times close to the Communists, but renounced any party membership, not only out of consideration for his activities. 
In 1933 he set up a contact point for refugees from Germany in the Zett House on Badenerstrasse. 
Among those he supported was the writer Friedrich Wolf. 
The exhibition "Facts about the Soviet Union", which he played a leading role in organizing in Basel in 1934, was much criticised.[3] 
Works 
He was also an important mentor of the "Gruppe 33".[2].From 1923, Schmidt was a contributor to the architecture magazine Werk. 
Mies van der Rohe invited him to give lectures at the Bauhaus in Dessau, and Schmidt also repeatedly entertained the idea of going to Moscow, where his brother Hans was working as an architect. 
On March 1, 1939, Schmidt was appointed, against the will of the advisory commission, to succeed Otto Fischer as curator (director) of the Öffentliche Kunstsammlung Basel (Basel Art Museum). 
Georg Schmidt expanded the modern art department, which achieved international importance under his leadership. 
In 1949, he presented a Gauguin exhibition at the Kunstmuseum. 
As early as 1946, he planned the purchase of works by the artist Alberto Giacometti. 
Maria Netter was Schmidt's assistant from 1944 to 1945. 
From 1958 until his death in 1965, he held a professorship at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. 
In 1964 he was honored with the Dr. h.c. of the ETH Zurich.

Schenkeli, carnival pastries from Southern Germany and Switzerland 
A Schenkele, or Schenkela (in Alsace), Schänkeli, Schenkeli, Schenggeli, Schänggeli (in Switzerland) is a small cylindrical sweet deep-fried pastry eaten around Christmas and Fasnacht in Alsace and German-speaking Switzerland. 
They are also known as pieds de chèvre ("goat's feet") in the Canton of Jura (due to the small incision made at one end of the dough making them resemble cloven hoofs.[1] Other names include cuisses de dames ("women's thighs") in France.[1] 
Preparation 
Schenkele are made from a dough of flour, sugar, butter, eggs, ground almonds or walnuts additionally flavored using candied orange or lemon peel and Kirsch. 
The dough is formed into finger-sized cylinders, deep-fried and dusted with sugar.[1][2] They are shelf-stable and their flavor intensifies with storage.[2]

In the climate of the Cold War, a polemical media campaign had raged against Brecht's work and person, making it almost impossible for Viennese theaters to perform his plays. 
In mid-1953, Brecht declared his solidarity with the SED in a letter to Walter Ulbricht and Otto Grotewohl and sanctioned its measures. 
In 1954, Hans Weigel and Friedrich Torberg launched a campaign against Brecht performances in Vienna. 
In the political-literary magazine FORVM (whose sponsor at the time was the CIA field organization "Congrès pour la Liberté de la Culture"). 
The theater magazine "Die Bühne" joined in the anti-Brecht campaign by printing the refusals of theater directors Franz Stoß and Ernst Haeussermann to play Brecht. 
Günther Nenning, on the other hand, advocated a performance of Brecht's works in FORVM despite certain misgivings. 
The few voices that opposed the boycott, such as Friedrich Heer, were denounced as "crypto-communists." 
In return, Heer called Hans Weigel a "little McCarthy," which earned him a conviction for libel. 
The New Theater at La Scala 
Only the New Theater at La Scala, an ensemble of returned émigrés and committed anti-fascists (many of them communists), located in the Soviet occupation sector of Vienna, devoted itself to Brecht's plays. 
In 1953, under the artistic direction of Bertolt Brecht himself, Manfred Wekwerth staged Die Mutter with Helene Weigel, Ernst Busch and Otto Tausig, a re-staging of the Berlin Ensemble's production from January 1951. 
Shortly before the premiere, the Theaterfreunde, Scala's audience organization, organized another Brecht evening in which the choir of Brown-Boveri, a Soviet-administered company, sang songs composed by Hanns Eisler. 
However, "Scala" was boycotted by the press and became a battle site in the cultural Cold War in Austria. 
Torberg and Weigel accused Scala of staging allegedly "communist tendency plays". 
The actors were dubbed "communist agents" by Hans Weigel. 
As part of an anti-communist campaign in Austria against the author Bertolt Brecht, his work was boycotted for ten years. 
Between 1953 and 1963, no established Viennese theater performed his works. 
The initiators were the publicists Hans Weigel and Friedrich Torberg as well as the Burgtheater director Ernst Haeussermann. 
When the Communist Party stopped financial support for La Scala after the withdrawal of the Soviet occupying powers, the theater had to close in 1956. 
Karl Paryla played the title role in Brecht's Life of Galileo one last time at La Scala in 1956. 
Paryla, his wife Hortense Raky, the Scala director Wolfgang Heinz and the actress Erika Pelikowsky then found a new artistic home at Brecht's own theater in Berlin, the Berliner Ensemble, since there were no more engagements for them in Austria. 
Breaking the boycott 
The "Salzburger Nachrichten" wrote: "If Brecht's banishment was interrupted for the first time with 'Mother Courage', it now seems to have been lifted with the 'Chalk Circle'" and "Die Bühne" called the performance a "theatrical event". 
The "Wiener Montag," however, still saw in the play "a pure Marxist doctrinal demonstration" and wrote: "After three hours of 'pleasure,' one left the theater ice-cold to the fingertips and disgusted by such political rallies on stage." 
Other theaters 
There were isolated exceptions to the Brecht boycott at theaters outside of Vienna. The Graz Opera House performed Mother Courage on May 30, 1958. 
Finally, in the spring of 1964, there were performances of The Caucasian Chalk Circle in Linz and Klagenfurt. 
On December 14, 1958, as part of a guest performance by the Deutsches Theater Berlin, an evening of songs and recitations was held at the Vienna Konzerthaus. The Brecht matinee included "Songs. 
Poems. 
Stories." which had been performed for the first time in Berlin on February 10, 1957. 
The majority of the Viennese press kept quiet about the concert. 
In the Volksstimme, the central organ of the Austrian Communist Party, Edmund Theodor Kauer took the Brecht evening as an opportunity to criticize the continuing Brecht boycott." 
1966 saw Brecht's first performance at Vienna's Burgtheater, Life of Galileo directed by Kurt Meisel with Curd Jürgens in the title role. 
In the Federal Republic of Germany, too, a Brecht boycott was propagated intermittently in 1953 and after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, but it did not catch on. 
The Munich critic Joachim Kaiser called the Austrian "Brecht boycott" a "remarkable journalistic triumph.[1] 
As late as 1973, in the course of the Forum Stadtpark's split from the Austrian P.E.N. Club, Alfred Kolleritsch and Klaus Hoffer called Friedrich Torberg a "Brecht-blocker" and "CIA protégé" in the magazine manuskripte, which resulted in a libel case. 
Brecht's Citizenship 
Brecht and Austria 
Juli 2011, abgerufen am 7. November 2020. 
In: Der Monat 14, 1961. 
In 1948, Leopold Lindtberg directed Mother Courage and Her Children at Vienna's La Scala with Therese Giehse in the title role and in 1952, the Volkstheater staged The Threepenny Opera with Hans Putz and Inge Konradi. 
Brecht was stateless after the National Socialists revoked his German citizenship in 1935. 
A scandal ensued when, on the recommendation of the composer Gottfried von Einem, who was a member of the directorate of the Salzburg Festival, he was granted Austrian citizenship in Salzburg on April 12, 1950. 
The Austrian public, however, was not informed and when it became known through an indiscretion in the fall of 1951, a storm of protest ensued. 
Brecht had been living in East Berlin since 1948 and was considered a sympathizer of the East-German Communist regime. 
The leading theaters, above all the Vienna Burgtheater and the Theater in der Josefstadt, henceforth refused to play Brecht. 
Gottfried von Einem was expelled from the Festival Board at the instigation of Josef Klaus, governor of Salzburg, for "undermining the Festival." 
At a meeting of the Salzburg Festival Board of Trustees on October 31, 1951, Klaus insulted von Einem as a "disgrace to Austria" and a "liar" and demanded his immediate dismissal. 
(Die Neue Front). Other newspapers spoke of the "devil's poet," the "literary spawn," and "the greatest cultural scandal of the Second Republic." Brecht was now discredited in Austria's official cultural scene, and a collaboration with the Salzburg Festival failed, although Brecht had been envisaged by Gottfried von Einem to lead a "renewal of the Festival" and had been planning a "counter-Jedermann" for the Festival since 1949.

Nord Nord Mord is a 2011 German crime film series produced by ZDF. 
From 2011 until 2018, Robert Atzorn played the role of Chief Inspector Theo Clüver in eight episodes. 
The first episode with Peter Heinrich Brix as Commissioner Carl Sievers (the ninth in total) was broadcast on October 15, 2018.[1] 
Reception 
The films in the series predominantly gave the impression of “a crime series in the Rosamunde Pilcher style, full of clichés, predictable in plot and character development, with subtle dialogue jokes and a soft pop soundtrack [...], a classic example of the solid television film escapism that is in the program of ARD and ZDF plays a major role.”[1] 
Nord Nord Mord at IMDb Nord Nord Mord at fernsehserien.de ZDF Press Portal: Nord Nord Mord 
Plot 
At the Sylt detective agency, the edgy chief inspector Theo Clüver is more inclined to solve cases with empathy, patience and instinct rather than using modern investigative methods. 
His colleague, Ina Behrendsen, approaches the cases objectively, austerely and without emotion, while Hinnerk Feldmann, who comes from the Baltic Sea, stands out with his know-it-all attitude. 
After Clüver's (Atzorn's) retirement, his position was taken over by the rather reserved and uncommunicative chief inspector Carl Sievers, who was transferred from Kiel to Sylt and combines a professional approach with an alert mind. 
However, he seems to be also carrying a health burden. 
Cast 
Leading actor Robert Atzorn left the series at his own request after the eighth episode, Clüver and the Silent Death. 
His successor was Peter Heinrich Brix.[1]

Mario Markus (*born July 29 1944 in Santiago de Chile) is a German-Chilean physicist who worked for a long time in the Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology in Dortmund. 
In addition to his scientific work, Markus has exhibited his own computer graphics, as well as written novels and poetry and translated spanisch poems. 
In numerous encounters with the media[1] he has followed his main concern of bridging the "two cultures", science and art. 
In 2009 he published a comprehensive book on that subject with a CD-ROM for the reader to create such graphics. 
The german book “Die Kunst der Mathematik” (The Art of Mathematics) was also published in Spanish. 
Below are some examples of Markus Lyapunov diagrams that appear in that book. 
Simulation of hallucinations / the "light at the end of the tunnel" 
Simulation of a hallucination, which can occur, among other things, due to a lack of oxygen. 
In 1994, Markus published a computational simulation ofHallucinations, which are caused by a lack of oxygen, among other things, and which resemble the “light at the end of the tunnel” that is sometimes described in near-death experiences. 
Markus writes: 
"There is no doubt that the calculated concentric circles, spirals and tunnels are archetypal structures, as follows from well-known interviews conducted by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross with persons close to clinical death. 
Some of these persons had even been declared dead before their reports. 
She wrote several books about it. 
The visions of tunnels with a light at its end, which are described in these books and which are very similar to the available computer simulations, have been interpreted as 'evidence' of a path into the 'afterlife'. 
One of the arguments for this claim is that the visions are independent of the cultural or religious environment of the 'seers', giving the impression of being 'absolute'. 
In contrast, the results of the present work show that what all 'seers' have in common is not the 'afterlife', but the physiology of their brains." See: Mario Markus, “Hallucinations: their formation in the cerebral cortex can be simulated on the computer” — Mario Markus, in „Halluzinationen: ihre Entstehung in der Hirnrinde kann im Computer simuliert werden“, [1] 
2D Crystals 
Markus discovered and described in detail a special type of crystal in the sense of "Ludic Science". They have been shown in several exhibitions in Dortmund, Berlin[1] and Heidelberg, among others, and have received positive feedback in the press. 
These 2D crystals are formed when microscope slides are wetted with a hydrophilic substance and allowed to dry. 
A drop of a chemical solution spontaneously spreads over the entire slide and crystallizes in a form that is completely different from known 3D crystals or monomolecular 2D crystals.[2] Examples of Markus’ 2D crystals are shown here below. 
Prize for “Ludic Sciences” 
Research projects are nowadays increasingly being funded or rewarded under the aspect of concrete applicability. 
However, there are many examples in past times in which fundamental discoveries were made through curiosity or through play. 
This applies, for example, to the beginnings of electromagnetism by Oersted and Faraday, among others. 
Mario Markus coined the term "ludic science" (Latin: ludus, the game). 
Examples of this can be found in his book “Ludische Wissenschaften”. 
In order to finance the award, he leaves his house worth almost one million euros to the Gesellschaft deutscher Chemiker in his testament.[1][2]

Markus was born to German parents in Chile. 
He attended the Liceo Manuel de Salas in Santiago and spent the school year 1961/1962 as an exchange student of the AFS in the USA. 
In early 1963 he passed his high school diploma in Chile. 
In 1970 he obtained his physics diploma under Konrad Tamm at the Institute for Applied Physics at the University of Heidelberg with a thesis on the Pinch-Effekt in plasmas made up of electrons and holes in semiconductors. 
From March 1970 to 1973 he conducted research for his doctorate on instabilities in plasmas at this institute. 
At the beginning of 1973 he received his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.). 
After working as an assistant at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Heidelberg, he moved to the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt am Main in April 1974. 
From January 1975 he was a research associate at the former Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Nutritional Physiology (today's MPI for Molecular Physiology) in Dortmund in the department of the biochemist and biophysicist Benno Hess. 
In 1988 he habilitated at the University of Dortmund, where he was first appointed a lecturer and then, in August 1997, an associate professor. 
Since 1993 he has headed his own research group at the MPI for Molecular Physiology. 
In 2004 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Chilean Academy of Sciences (Academia Chilena de Ciencias). 
Markus has published around 160 original scientific papers mainly on questions of self-organization and chaos in biology, physics and chemistry. 
In addition to his scientific work, he has published several volumes of poetry, a novel, a comic and works on computer graphics. 
Works and exhibitions with computer graphics 
Since the 1980s, Markus has created numerous works and created exhibitions with computer graphics based on his novel representation of Ljapunow exponents (Ljapunow diagrams or Ljapunow fractals or Markus- Ljapunow diagrams). 
It should be noted, howeve, that many of these representations do not meet the mathematical definition of fractals, in which sections are similar or equal to the overall picture. 
The graphics were exhibited at the following locations, among others: 
Samuel Henzi, title page of LA CONQUETE DE LA SAXE (1745) 
Samuel Henzi was born the son of the pastor Johannes Henzi (1667-1740) and Maria Katharina Herzog. 
In his position as a copyist and bookkeeper at the Bern salt chamber, he was self-taught and possibly taught the patrician daughter Julie Bondeli as a private tutor.[1] In the hope of a career and fortune, he bought himself a captain's position in the service of the Duke of Modena and Reggio, but failed miserably.[2] 
In 1744, Samuel Henzi, who had signed a memorial for the restoration of Bern's old constitution, was expelled by resolution of the country's Great Council.[1] In Neuchâtel he was editor of the Mercure Suisse and a contributor to the Journal hélvetique.[2] Henzi wrote several French poems, some under the pseudonym M.O.L.E.E.B.H.[3] From 1747 he published the three-volume La messagerie de Pinde, which contains an ode and a sonnet on the election of the Bernese mayor Christoph Steiger. 
He wrote an ode to Frederick the Great and supported Johann Jakob Bodmer in his polemics against Johann Christoph Gottsched. 
In 1748 he was pardoned and worked in Bern as a sub-librarian.[4] Johann Rudolf Sinner, who was only 18 years old at the time, was given preference when he applied to be senior librarian.[5] 
In 1749, together with his brother-in-law, the merchant Samuel Niklaus Wernier, he got involved in a conspiracy that aimed to overthrow the Bernese government and that was known as Burgerlärm, later known as the "Henzi conspiracy" (Henzi-Verschwörung). 
In 1762 his drama Grisler ou l'ambition punie about Albrecht Gessler (= Grisler) and Wilhelm Tell was published posthumously and anonymously. 
It was able to maintain and even expand its high medical standards even after the political collapse of 1918. 
Because of a nursing scandal in the neighboring geriatric center, it was renamed Krankenhaus Hietzing (around 2000), but this was largely ignored by the general public. 
In 2020, the hospital was renamed Klinik Hietzing as part of the standardization of the naming of municipal hospitals.[1] 
Healthcare situation 1907–1918 
Until then, in addition to the university hospitals, practically only religious and private hospitals had been available to the inhabitants. 
Only in retrospect can the significance of this communal upheaval be assessed, which also earned much criticism. 
The (predominantly bourgeois) deputies overrode all reservations and created an institution for the benefit of the sick, in which "science will celebrate its triumphs for the salvation of mankind, free and independent of the pernicious clique system" (Karl Lueger at the laying of the foundation stone in 1908). 
The decision was also of a party and socio-political nature: in 1907 Austria introduced universal suffrage, which greatly increased the expectation of public assistance for everyone. 
When it opened, the hospital had eight departments: two medical, one surgical, and one each for urology, skin and sexually transmitted diseases, gynecology and obstetrics, and eye and ENT diseases. 
In addition, there was an X-ray institute and one each for physical therapy, for pathology and for serodiagnostics. 
The newly appointed primary physicians were soon among the world's leading medical experts. 
Far-sighted was the planning of the urology department. 
The Lainz department was one of the few independent institutes of its kind. Surgery of the urinary tract was not developed until 1897 in Trieste, and the need in Vienna was estimated at 100 beds. 
Almost all of Austria's later primary urological physicians came from this department. 
Further expansion after1918 
Although the monarchy collapsed in 1918 and Vienna's population declined in numbers, the Lainzer Spital was further expanded in the 1920s. 
According to the will of the now Social Democratic city government, it was to become a kind of social "counter-university" and was given elaborate treatment apparatus and additional hospital outpatient departments for emergencies. 
It received its most important enlargement in 1930/31 under City Councilor Julius Tandler, the great reformer of Vienna's health care system. 
Three new specialized departments (metabolic diseases, tuberculosis and lung diseases) and a department for radiation therapy greatly expanded the possibilities (see also Hilda Fonovits). 
The metabolic department was the only one in Austria to also deal with nutritional disorders and healing methods of dietetics. 
The TBC and lung pavilions are still exemplary today. 
The tuberculosis pavilion, which was urgently needed at the time, later became the heart-lung center. 
The special department for radiation therapy was established in 1931 on the model of the Radium Institute in Stockholm. 
Vienna was the third city in the world to purchase radium for the irradiation of cancer patients - a sensation at the time. 
The cost of the first 5,000 milligrams of radium was high, and Vienna was the talk of the town. 
The tradition started then continued in 1959 with the first so-called cobalt gun (cobalt-60 irradiation) and the first betatron facility. 
After Anschluss the Jewish doctors and hospital director were fired and persecuted and their history erased. During the Second World War, three pavilions of the neighboring nursing home (today Geriatriezentrum Am Wienerwald) were taken over by Lainzer Krankenhaus due to decreasing demand. 
New buildings were also added after 1945, all buildings were modernized and the former large wards were converted into small units of one, two or four beds. 
Like any hospital, "Lainz" changed according to the needs of patients and the city. 
A separate dentistry, a center for vascular surgery, a blood bank and a department for neurology were established. 
As of January 1, 2006, the Rosenhügel Neurological Center was merged with the Lainz Hospital. 
Of the approximately 215,000 square meters of the park, only a few percent have been built up to date. 
Again and again, plans emerge to reallocate it for residential buildings and budget renovation. 
Since 2020, the hospital has been operating under the name Klinik Hietzing. 
Trinity Chapel 
The Holy Trinity Chapel is a Roman Catholic hospital chapel located on the mezzanine floor of Pavilion IV of the hospital built according to the plans of architect Johann Nepomuk Scheiringer. 
It was built as a rectangular hall with barrel vault and polygonal choir and inset organ loft. 
The hall is lit on both sides by three rectangular windows surmounted by semi-circular arches. 
The choir is separated by a bronze lattice communion bench. 
Erected figures Sacred Heart of Jesus by Florian Josephu-Drouot and Sacred Heart of Mary by Anton Endstorfer. 
The triptych Heilkunst from 1913 is by Hans Zatzka. 
Glazed Stations of the Cross reliefs by Heinrich Epler from 1896 are embedded in the side walls. 
The Roland Fountain was erected in the course of the construction of the hospital in the center of the large garden courtyard, respectively in the main axis of the hospital, and was unveiled around 1913. 
On a three-tiered pedestal, where two steps are formed as fountain basins, stands a monumental statue of Roland, which was created by the academic sculptor Josef Heu and allegedly holds the features of the Viennese mayor Karl Lueger. 
„Lainz“ in the form of two institutions in the green 
The Lainzer Krankenhaus, or "Lainz" for short, as it was called by the population, was built according to the most modern health theory of the time as a complex with about 10 pavilions divided according to specialties in a park area of about 10 hectares. 
The area is located in the southwest of Vienna and the 13th district (Hietzing) and is only about 1 km from the eastern slopes of the Vienna Woods, which guarantees good air quality. 
On an area twice as large, adjoining to the northwest, the "Versorgungsheim Lainz" had already been built in 1902-1904 with two dozen pavilions for the care of several thousand old people. 
It last bore the name "Geriatriezentrum am Wienerwald" (Geriatric Center at the Vienna Woods) until its closure in 2015 and, like the hospital later, was the consequence of the new Homeland Law, which gave everyone the right to poor relief or old-age care after ten years of residence in Vienna. 
Together, these two large institutes consolidated the worldwide reputation of the Viennese medical school, which had been established by van Swieten and Ignaz Semmelweis, among others. 
In 1907, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph, the City of Vienna decided to build its first hospital "voluntarily and without recognition of any legal obligation ... with the intention of relieving Vienna's hospital shortage as extensively and as quickly as possible". 
Until then, medical care had been mainly on the shoulders of a few foundation and order hospitals. 
The new hospital was to be equipped with "state-of-the-art science and technology" and also serve to train doctors. 
Until 1918 it was called "Kaiser-Jubiläums-Spital". 
After that it was given the simpler name "Krankenhaus Lainz". 
He represented his native country as ambassador to the United Nations and as envoy to the United States, and served as Venezuela's minister of justice from 1958 to 1962. 
From 1991 until his death, he served as a judge at the International Court of Justice. 
Andrés Aguilar Mawdsley studied at the Universidad Central de Venezuela, where he earned a doctorate in political and social sciences, and at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, where he earned a master's degree in civil law. 
From 1958 to 1962, he served as Minister of Justice of Venezuela. 
He was also a member of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights from 1972 to 1985, during which time he served as president on several occasions. 
From 1986 to 1991, he again represented his home country as a permanent representative to the United Nations in New York. 
In November 1990, he was elected by the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly to serve as a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. 
He took office in February 1991, but died in October 1995 about halfway through his nine-year rotating term. 
In keeping with the traditions of the Court, his compatriot Gonzalo Parra-Aranguren was elected to succeed Andrés Aguilar Mawdsley for the remainder of his term. 
Andrés Aguilar Mawdsley belonged to the Academia de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales de Venezuela (Academy of Political and Social Sciences of Venezuela) since 1978 and was also a member of the Institut de Droit international since 1983.

Adler & Oppenheimer was for a time the largest corporation in the European leather industry. 
Adler & Oppenheimer Aktiengesellschaft was the commercial center of the group. 
Colloquially, the group and the stock corporation were known as A & O. The company was founded in Strasbourg in 1872 and was a stock corporation from 1900. 
The company headquarters were moved to Berlin in 1920. 
Major operating sites of the AG existed in Neustadt-Glewe and in Neumünster. 
Other important Group operating sites were in Oisterwijk (Netherlands), Wiltz (Luxembourg) and Littleborough near Manchester. 
The majority in the group was held by the German-Jewish owner families Adler and Oppenheimer. 
From 1919/20, the legal core of the A & O Group was N.V. Amsterdamsche Leder Maatschappij (Almi), which largely functioned as a holding company. 
The renaming of Adler & Oppenheimer AG to Norddeutsche Lederwerke AG in 1940/41 was connected with the Aryanization of the company. 
Adler & Oppenheimer did good business as a leather supplier during the First World War. 
Profits rose at a strongly disproportionate rate in the first three years of the war (see graph). 
Before the end of the First World War, Adler & Oppenheimer were able to acquire a majority shareholding in the Emil Köster AG leather factory in Neumünster, Germany..[1]Due to the good rail connection to the port of Hamburg, through which both raw hides and tanning materials were imported in large quantities, as well as the lack of restrictive water legislation in Schleswig-Holstein until 1913, a significant leather industry had developed in Neumünster.[2] 
After the end of the First World War, there were first coercive measures at the end of 1918 to the detriment of the Lingolsheim part of the company in the context of the reintegration of Alsace into the Republic of France. 
On January 2, 1919, the entire Alsatian property of Adler & Oppenheimer was confiscated by the French military administration..[1] In the following months, efforts were made to deport the founding families to Germany. 
A first attempt at expulsion failed due to the resistance of French members of parliament from the Bas-Rhin department and the Strasbourg city government. 
Nevertheless, the families had to leave France on March 17, 1920. 
Despite the expulsion, the families remained connected to Strasbourg. 
Many of the family members who died before World War II were buried in the Koenigshoffen Jewish Cemetery. 
New begining near Straßburg (1920–1930) 
An extraordinary shareholders' meeting of Adler & Oppenheimer AG moved the company's headquarters to Berlin on March 31, 1920. 
In accordance with the agreements of the Versailles Peace Treaty, the company received compensation of 48 million marks from the Reich government for the expropriation of the Lingolsheim plant. 
This compensation was to be used to rebuild production. 
The funds were used to completely take over the shares in the Emil Köster AG leather factory in Neumünster and in Lederwerke Neustadt G.m.b.H. and to considerably expand the plants. 
Sales offices were founded in Frankfurt am Main, Cologne and Pirmasens.[1] Furthermore, leather factories in the Netherlands and Luxembourg were purchased (see below). 
The link with the Dutch leather industry went beyond the purchase of a leather factory. 
The owner families transferred their company shares in A & O to the Dutch "N. V. Amsterdamsche Leder Maatschappij" (Almi), which had been founded for the import of hides..[1] 
The post-war history of the largely restituted Western European plants was marked from around 1960 by an increasingly existential crisis in the leather industry, which led to the closure of the plants. 
Only in the successor company in Neustadt-Glewe, the VEB Lederwerk August Apfelbaum, leather was produced in significant quantities until the "Wende". 
Through the employers' association Norddeutscher Gerbereiverband, A & O was involved in the collective bargaining disputes of 1923/24. 
The German Leather Workers' Association rejected an extension of working hours to 49 hours/week. 
After the economic upheavals of hyperinflation, the share capital was reduced to 15 million gold marks, the preferred capital to 0.12 million gold marks. 
World Economic Crisis and Nazi persecution (1930–1945) 
In line with the general economic situation in Germany, economic results deteriorated during the Great Depression, only to recover in the first half of the 1930s. 
The plant in Neustadt-Glewe alone employed 2000 people in the mid-1930s. 
After further conversions, Adler & Oppenheimer's share capital amounted to 18 million Reichsmarks in 1937. 
From 1936, sales fell again, especially the important foreign sales.[1] The company operated in the late 1930s the production of vache and sole leather, blank leather, chrome upper leather and fine leather.[2] 
Nazi persecution of company employees 
In 1934, a trial for "high treason" was brought against 14 Mecklenburg Communists in Bützow. 
From the mid-1930s, anti-Jewish repression also intensified in Holstein. 
Clemens Oppenheimer's two daughters, Anne and Hedwig Oppenheimer, also left Germany. 
Aryanization 
Founding and development (1872–1919) 
In July 1940, on the instructions of the Reich Minister of Economics to Abs, the company applied to change its name to Norddeutsche Lederwerke AG. Norddeutsche Lederwerke AG was listed on the stock exchanges in Berlin and Frankfurt.[5] .[6] .[7] 
"Aryanization" consisted of the takeover of a 75% shareholding by a consortium led by Deutsche Bank AG. 
After the occupation of the Netherlands, direct pressure could be exerted on Almi, but Almi had pledged a large part of the A & O shares to the USA. 
Furthermore, some members of the owner families lived in France. 
The "Aryanization" of Adler & Oppenheimer was the subject of U.S. investigations after the end of World War II (OMGUS Report), as well as two historical commissions. (OMGUS-Report[1]), .[2] 
Das Gericht bewertete alle Vorwürfe als unzutreffend und verurteilte Czichon auf Unterlassung und Zahlung von Schmerzensgeld.[1][2] Dem britischen Historiker Harold James zufolge wurde die Deutsche Bank vor allem wegen der komplexen internationalen Wirtschaftsverflechtungen mit Fällen wie dem von Adler & Oppenheimer befasst; auch Abs' persönliche Kontakte hätten eine zentrale Rolle bei der „Germanisierung“ von A & O gespielt. 
Im Zusammenspiel mit amtlichen deutschen Stellen habe sich die Bank an einer Erpressung beteiligt, um die Sicherheit von drei sich noch im Machtbereich Nazi-Deutschlands aufhaltenden Familienmitgliedern gegen die Zustimmung zur Eigentumsübertragung einzutauschen.[3] 
North German Leather Works in World War II 
Norddeutsche Lederwerke AG in Neumünster housed forced laborers. 
The Mecklenburg plant was used to produce aircraft engines due to the curtailed leather production. 
The plant survived the war without destruction.[1] 
Postwar 1945 
They founded the Adler & Oppenheimer OHG leather wholesale business there on May 6, 1872. 
On June 10 of the same year, they set up a leather factory in the Montagne-Vertedie district of Strasbourg. 
The company had great economic success due to the introduction of chrome tanning. 
In 1889, two children of the founders, Friedrich Léon Adler and Julius Oppenheimer, built a new tannery in Lingolsheim, a few kilometers away. 
Restitution to the Jewish family that owned the company 
The settlement was reached with Relda Trading Co. Ltd. 
(New York), which represented the interests of the Adler and Oppenheimer families. 
As a result, the former owner families were restored to a majority shareholding in the company via Relda and Almi. 
The plant in Neustadt-Glewe was affected by Soviet dismantling in 1945/46. 
In June 1946, the Soviet Military Administration (SMAD) released the plant into the hands of the German administration. 
In 1948, the plant was initially owned by the state of Mecklenburg, but was then converted into a nationally owned enterprise (VEB). 
From 1951, the plant was called VEB Lederwerk "August Apfelbaum". 
The name was given in honor of the trade unionist and communist August Apfelbaum, who had moved to Lüneburg after his dismissal from A & O in 1935. 
Apfelbaum had been interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp since September 7, 1939. 
He died in 1945 during an Allied air raid..[1] 
The Adler and Oppenheimer families soon belonged to the leading industrialist families of Alsace-Lorraine.[1] The importance of the families manifested itself, for example, in the election of the company founder Isaak Adler in 1885 as the first German Jew to the Strasbourg City Council.[2] 
The VEB had up to 1700 employees in the GDR era and was the largest leather manufacturing company in the GDR. 
The main focus was on pigskin (since 1949) and imitation leather (since 1974). 
Cowhide production was discontinued in 1972. 
At the end of the 1970s, VEB was the largest producer of pigskin in Europe. 
In the 1980s, the plant also produced medical and clothing products. 
The company was awarded a number of important GDR awards (including Karl Marx Order, Enterprise of Excellent Quality Work). 
The VEB was integrated as a plant into the VEB Kombinat Kunstleder und Pelzverarbeitung, Leipzig..[1] 
After 1990, the company operated under the names NG Leder GmbH and Nordleder GmbH. 
Leather production was discontinued in 2007. 
One business focus was on drive belts for industry. 
A new process was used for rapid tanning by means of water pressure. 
Following compensation for the forced sale of the Lingolsheim plant, Friedrich Léon Adler and Julius Oppenheimer bought the company on May 18, 1920. 
After an interim capital increase of 4 million francs, there was a further increase to 12 million francs in 1922. 
These new shares were subscribed by the Dutch company Almi, which served the Adler and Oppenheimer families as the holding company for the A&O Group. 
Major fires occurred in 1924 and 1926. 
In addition to the production of belts, the production of boxcalf and other fine leather was added in those years. 
The company, which in French was called IDÉAL Tannerie de Wiltz S.A., had 777 employees in 1935..[1] 
Im Eingangsbereich des Werks gibt es heute eine Erinnerungstafel und in Wiltz ein Ehrenmal.[4] 
In 1900, the company was transformed into the joint stock company Adler & Oppenheimer A.-G., Strasbourg i. Els. 
Louis Hartog, the founder and co-owner of Gocher Lederwerke, was appointed chairman of the supervisory board..[1][2][3][4] Produced mainly shoe leather and other high quality leather goods of international reputation.[5][6] 
In 1916, C.J. van der Aa and Rotterdam merchant Jan Adolf Vermetten founded a leather factory in Oisterwijk (Netherlands). 
In mid-August 1928, Almi reorganized its administration. 
40 employees were transferred from Amsterdam, Almi's headquarters, to Oisterwijk. 
For the newcomers, company housing was built in the street that is still called "Almistraat" today. 
At the beginning of 1930, the recreational association "Almy-Nevelo vereniging" was founded. 
The former telegram address "NEVELO" of the factory in Oisterwijk still gives the name to a soccer club in Oisterwijk, which goes back to the former factory club.t.[1][2] 
The factory was awarded the title of "Royal" leather factory (Koninklijke Lederfabriek te Oisterwijk) in 1932. 
He took Dutch citizenship in 1935. 
It is known of Erich Rudolph Adler that he fled to America with his wife and family in August 1940. During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, the plant came under external administration.[1] 
Es wird geschätzt, dass etwa zwei Drittel der englischen Kriegsproduktion an Oberleder für Soldatenstiefel aus Littleborough stammten.[3] 
After the establishment of the joint stock company, sufficient capital was available to establish or purchase further operating facilities. 
The first new factory ("Lederwerke Neustadt in Mecklenburg") was to be built in Neustadt-Glewe in Mecklenburg and produce cowhide.

The Constitutional Court of the Land of Berlin (BerlVerfGH) is the constitutional court of Berlin. It has its seat in the Kammergericht building at Heinrich-von-Kleist-Park in the Schöneberg district. President since 2019 is Ludgera Selting [de]. 
The Constitution of Berlin of 1 September 1950 already contained in its Article 72 the mandate to establish a Constitutional Court. 
However, due to the special political and legal position of the Land of Berlin, such a court was not constituted until German reunification, despite several political initiatives. 
Nor was any use made of the possibility offered by Article 99 of the Basic Law (GG) to assign jurisdiction over disputes under Land constitutional law to the Federal Constitutional Court. 
The Berlin House of Representatives passed the law on the Constitutional Court of Berlin on 8 November 1990. 
Even before the first election of constitutional judges, however, the law had to be amended. 
The main reason for this was the regulation on the judges' allowances. 
It was supposed to correspond to that of the members of parliament, and even higher rates were planned for the President and the Vice-President of the Constitutional Court. 
This would have meant that the expense allowances of the Berlin constitutional judges would have been far higher than those of the members of other state constitutional courts, which met with harsh public criticism. 
This provision was therefore revised, as was the provision on the majority requirement for the election of constitutional judges, for which a three-quarters majority of those voting was originally envisaged. 
As part of the amendment, the required majority was lowered to two-thirds of those voting. 
The constitution of the Constitutional Court was also delayed because the first elections of judges were preceded by a months-long dispute between the parliamentary groups represented in the House of Representatives over the question of who was allowed to propose how many candidates. 
At the time, the governing coalition of CDU and SPD would have been in a position to draw up the list of nominees on its own, as it could unite more than two-thirds of the mandates. 
In the end, however, it was agreed with the opposition to include one proposal each from the Liberals and the Greens; only the PDS was left empty-handed. 
In May 1992, the Constitutional Court was finally able to begin its work. 
The first president of the Constitutional Court was Klaus Finkelnburg, and Ehrhart Körting became vice-president. 
Other constitutional judges in 1992 included Hans-Joachim Driehaus, Klaus Eschen and Philip Kunig. 
The decision that a prosecution of Erich Honecker, the former Chairman of the Council of State of the GDR, was incompatible with human dignity under Article 1 of the Basic Law due to his state of health caused controversial debates both in the public and in jurisprudence. 
From 2007 to 2012, a woman headed the court for the first time, Margret Diwell. 
President since 2019 is Ludgera Selting.

She was a dedicated social welfare worker, educator and patron of the arts both in Cologne and after emigrating to the Netherlands and the United States. 
She settled on the west coast of the USA. 
Hertha Kraus, a social scientist and Quaker who had also fled Cologne, asked Margarete Tietz to help move an old people's home for refugees from Europe from New York to Newark. 
As she had done in Germany and the Netherlands, Margarete Tietz was committed to helping sick and elderly citizens, especially refugees and survivors of the Holocaust..[1] She established a social foundation in her name and took over the management of various social institutions. 
At New York University she deepened her knowledge in the field of gerontology..[2] She founded the Margaret Tietz Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, where - similar to the Riehler Heimstätten housing project conceived by Hertha Kraus in Cologne - residents of different denominations could live in a complex with a residential home, nursing homes and a care area for people with physical and mental disabilities.

As in Berlin, she also taught children from underprivileged backgrounds in Cologne 
Together with her husband, she supported numerous social projects in Cologne after the end of the war and was actively involved in social welfare. 
She was for a time chairwoman of the Sisters' Association of the Jewish Asylum, to which she had belonged since 1911, chairwoman of the Association for Mothers' and Children's Rights and Cologne Association for Women's Studies. 
Together with her mother-in-law Flora Tietz, she was a member of the Cologne Women's Club.[1] She also founded the summer camp for working women and was a co-founder of the Cologne Family Service. 
For a time she headed the Jewish Women's League in Cologne, the Sisterhood of the Rhineland and Moriahloge, and the Jewish People's Kitchen founded in 1919.[2][3][4][5] 
In 1929 she was one of the co-founders of GEDOK in Cologne. 
In the following period she supported numerous young female artists. 
Immediately after the Nazis seized power, Jewish stores and department stores were boycotted, loans were cancelled by the banks and the owners were put under massive pressure to hand over the management to "Aryan hands.[1] Financially cornered, on March 31, 1933 - one day before the first nationwide "Boycott Day" - the board of Tietz AG resigned in unison. 
Over the next few weeks, Leonhard Tietz was forced to sell the company far below its value. 
The department stores of Leonhard Tietz AG were "Aryanized" and "taken over" by Westdeutsche Kaufhof AG. 
Immediately before the boycott actions, the Tietz family fled to Amsterdam with their children and mother-in-law Flora Tietz. 
The Tietz couple returned to Cologne once again at short notice to settle business matters. 
Because of her Jewish origin, she had to give up all association offices in the spring of 1933. 
Margerete Tietz left Cologne on July 9, 1933 and went with her husband to the Saar region. 
In 1934, the couple also emigrated to Amsterdam. 
Here she became involved in the Jewish Advisory Board as well as in the Joodsche Vrouwencomité and founded a Club of Refugees in Amsterdam. 
She supported and taught German emigrants before their emigration to England and the United States..[2] 
Immediately before the Wehrmacht invaded Amsterdam, the Tietz family fled to Palestine in 1940 on the last ship to leave. 
A year later, on August 4, 1941, Alfred Tietz died at the age of 58. 
In order to secure her livelihood, Margarete Tietz opened a guesthouse in Jerusalem-Talpiot. 
She used the proceeds to finance her daughter Herta's medical studies. 
After the Second World War, a return to Germany was out of the question for Margarete Tietz. 
In 1948, she emigrated from Palestine to the United States, which was originally favored by the Tietz couple and where numerous relatives and close friends of the family had settled..[1]

„"Today is Paula's birthday. 
How may she spend it? 
Not even one's thoughts can be sent to a fixed point - and yet she will feel them," she wrote in a letter in August 1942. 
Relatives in Switzerland persuaded her to leave Hitler's Germany, but Hannah Karminski rejected all opportunities to emigrate herself or to escape illegally out of a deep attachment to her humanitarian duties.,[1]

Hannah Karminski, daughter of the banker Adolf Abraham Karminski and his wife Selma née Cohn, was born in her parents' apartment at 22 Oranienburger Strasse in the Spandauer Vorstadt district of Berlin[1]. 
After attending the Luisenschule, Hannah trained as a kindergarten teacher at the renowned Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus. 
She then worked for a short time in a Jewish kindergarten in Berlin and subsequently attended the Social Pedagogical Institute in Hamburg run by Gertrud Bäumer and Marie Baum, where she trained as a social worker. 
She took up her first post in Frankfurt am Main as head of the Jewish Girls' Club there. 
Here she came into contact with Bertha Pappenheim, who was almost 40 years her senior, and who won her over to the Jewish Women's League. 
Around 1925, Hannah Karminski returned to Berlin and took over the editorship of the Jüdischer Frauenbund's sheets for women's work and women's movement until 1938. 
An important concern of Hannah Karminski's was to assert and develop the education and occupation of adolescent Jewish women against the traditional image of the family, with the goal of their social equality. 
When, in April 1933, Jewish girls and women were no longer allowed to be admitted to the existing kindergarten teachers' and nursery nurses' seminaries, Hannah Karminski supported the establishment of a Jewish seminary for the training of kindergarten teachers, nursery nurses and child care workers. 
On November 10, 1938, Hannah Karminski was arrested, but released after a few hours. 
From that day on, the Jüdischer Frauenbund's papers were banned. 
From 1939, after the forced dissolution of the Jewish Women's League, Hannah Karminski headed the welfare department, or later welfare and emigration counseling, within the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, which was forcibly merged by the Nazi authorities. 
She held this office until her deportation. 
In this responsible position, she helped thousands of people to emigrate and thus saved them from imminent extermination. 
She personally accompanied children's transports to England, through which a total of about 10,000 Jewish children from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia were saved. 
In addition to her work for the Reichsvereinigung, Hannah Karminski taught in the Jewish Seminar for Kindergarten and After-School Teachers, which she co-founded, where she also occasionally had to give exams. 
She was a founder and active member of Cologne women's and welfare associations and a promoter of numerous social projects. 
From 1919 to 1933, she was chairwoman of the City Federation of Cologne Women's Associations. 
Because of her Jewish religious affiliation, she was forced to resign from the chairmanship of the city association on March 22, 1933. 
Life and work 
In 1927, she was one of the founding members of the Cologne chapter of the women artists' association GEDOK, together with Alice Neven DuMont, numerous women artists and patrons of the Cologne society.[1] In addition to her social project work in Cologne, Else Falk held board positions in numerous supraregional associations and political organizations, including the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Stadtverbände von Rheinland und Westfalen, the Rheinisch-Westfälischer Frauenverband, and the Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine. 
After women were admitted to political parties, Else Falk was chairwoman of the National Liberal Women's Group. 
In 1918, she joined the newly founded, left-liberal German Democratic Party. 
In committees of the Cologne City Council, she represented the interests of women and the poor population of Cologne. 
Concerned about political developments in Germany, in 1932 she was one of the signatories of an appeal by the Cologne women's associations against Hitler's election as Reich Chancellor..[1] In the same year, she joined the German State Party, which had been newly formed in 1930 from the German Democratic Party. 
Here she was elected as the main confidant for the Cologne-Aachen constituency. 
Despite the increasing exclusion, Else Falk continued to be committed to the Jewish women artists who were excluded from the GEDOK because of their religious affiliation. 
She headed the Jewish Art Community in Cologne from 1934 to 1938. 
Bernhard and Else Falk were forced to change apartments in Cologne several times after 1933. 
During the November pogroms in 1938, the Falk family's apartment was completely devastated. 
After the war, when she no longer had any family ties to Cologne, she settled with her son in Brazil. 
She died in São Paulo at the age of 83. 
Private life 
On April 3, 1894, Else Wahl married the Bergheim lawyer Bernhard Falk in Barmen. 
Four sons were born of this marriage. 
The eldest son Alfred (born 1895) was killed in action in January 1917 as an officer in Manfred von Richthofen's fighter squadron. 
The second-born son Fritz (born 1898), who was married to Margarete Oevel, held a doctorate in law from the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf. 
On September 11, 1933, after his work permit was revoked and he was increasingly marginalized and humiliated, he committed suicide. 
He later fled to South America via France and settled in Brazil. 
His mother followed him after the death of her husband to spend the rest of her life in São Paulo.

Else Wahl was born in Barmen as the fourth of seven children of the Jewish Kommerzienrat Hermann Wahl and his wife Henny. 
The family moved in the circles of Rhenish assimilated Jewry, among others in the Central-Verein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens (Central Association of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith) of 1893. 
Her husband was involved in the National Liberal Association of Coeln and was elected to the Cologne City Council in 1908. 
On the initiative of the Cologne Women's History Association, a street in Cologne-Longerich now commemorates the social politician. 
On October 5, 2020, in front of the long-time residence of the Falk family in Cologne-Bayenthal - initiated by the Rhineland-Cologne Section of the German Alpine Club - stumbling blocks were laid by the artist Gunter Demnig in memory of Else Falk, her husband Bernhard and their son Ernst Hermann.[1]

Vol. 1: Politik, Wirtschaft, Öffentliches Leben. 
Before World War I, Else Falk - together with Rosa Bodenheimer, Mathilde von Mevissen and Klara Caro - campaigned for women's suffrage in the Cologne chapter of the Prussian National Association for Women's Suffrage. 
In 1914, Else Falk was elected treasurer of the National Women's Association.[1]During World War I, she initiated numerous social projects, especially to alleviate the plight of war invalids and widows with their children. 
In 1918, for example, she set up the first public library for the war-blind in Cologne and ran a shoemaker's workshop to provide an income for war invalids..[2] To increase the stock of books for the library for the blind, she and a group of women punched out books in Braille. 
Appeal of the German Democratic Party for the enforcement of women's suffrage, signed among others by Else Falk (1919) 
She was part of the organizing committee that hosted the 1921 Reichstagung of the Federation of German Women's Associations in Cologne's Gürzenich. 
During the hyperinflation, after the departure of the Quakers who helped to ensure the food supply in Cologne after the First World War, she organized the food distribution in the Association for Child Feeding in the City Association to provide food to needy families. 
Due to hyperinflation, large parts of Cologne's population became impoverished. 
In order to provide emergency relief, especially for impoverished widows, she campaigned for the construction of housing for small pensioners.[1] In the following ten years, four homes for the elderly were built on their initiative.[2] In 1923, she became involved - together with Josephine Erkens - in the establishment of the Cologne Women's Welfare Police. 
This rather socially oriented institution had a store in Cologne where it advertised its social assistance services. 
In addition to women from Cologne, English officers also served in the first Women's Welfare Police in the British occupation zone.[3] 
Starting in 1925, Else Falk, together with Alice Neven DuMont, published the news bulletin of the Stadtverband Kölner Frauenvereine, which was a weekly supplement in the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger and provided information on topics and events specific to women. 
In the same year, she founded the Cologne chapter of the 5th Welfare Association and in 1930 took over the chairmanship of this federation of Cologne institutions of independent welfare work..[1] 
In the second half of the 1920s, Else Falk devoted herself to the care of working mothers. 
Women with few means, who were exhausted and overworked, were to be given the opportunity to recover in mothers' cures. 
To this end, she founded the Verein für Müttererholung und Mütterschulung and the Örtliche Erholungsfürsorge für Mutter und Kind. 
The construction of various facilities, such as the recreation home for working women in Hummelsheim (1927) and the professional women's home at Bornheimer Strasse 4 in Cologne-Zollstock (1930), can be traced back to her initiative..[1] Recreational gardens were set up for the women in Cologne-Brück. 
To honor her commitment to women's welfare, the residential home for working women in Zollstock was renamed Else-Falk-Haus shortly after its inauguration.[2] As early as 1927, she supported Hertha Kraus in setting up the Riehler Heimstätten homes for the elderly and infirm, which were converted from former barracks buildings. 
Another of Else Falk's concerns was the fight against alcohol abuse, as it was the cause of domestic violence and further impoverishment in many working-class families. 
In 1927, she co-founded the Cologne GOA (Restaurants without Alcohol). 
In addition to restaurants where no alcohol was served, the GOA initiative supplied events, factories and construction sites with inexpensive, healthy food on a mobile basis using vehicles. 
It also campaigned for the establishment of so-called refreshment rooms in university and court dining halls.[1]

The Guitar Summit is a trade show focusing on stringed instruments, primarily electric guitars, bass guitars, acoustic guitars, guitar amplifiers, effects pedals and accessories. 
Since 2017, it has taken place once a year over a three-day weekend in September and is held at the m:con Congress Center Rosengarten in Mannheim, Germany. 
The event is organized by the German magazine Gitarre & Bass with local support from the City of Mannheim and mg: mannheimer gruendungszentren gmbh. 
Concerts are held at the end of the event days. 
The musical program covers a wide range of genres: rock, blues, metal, jazz, singer-songwriter or acoustic fingerstyle. 
The exhibition is designed as a "silent show". 
This means that, apart from the Guitar and Bass Amplifier area and the workshop stages, testing and demonstrating the musical instruments on display is only permitted via headphones in almost all areas of the exhibition. 
This will help to keep the noise level down during the event so that attendees and exhibitors can communicate with each other. 
About 4,500 visitors came to the m:con Congress Center Rosengarten in Mannheim. 
106 workshops were held on 6 stages, each lasting 30 minutes. 
In the Guitar and Bass Amplifiers area, for example, visitors were able to combine different guitar amplifiers with guitar cabinets at the touch of a button using a switching system. 
In the area for electric guitars and basses, a separate Boutique Area was dedicated to the guitar and bass builders of the European Guitar Builders e.V. 
(EGB). 
They were able to showcase their creations at a shared booth or at their own booth. 
Among the participating artists were Guthrie Govan, Victor Smolski, Jen Majura, Thomas Blug, Jon Gomm, and the German post-rock band Long Distance Calling.[1][2][3][4][5] 
Guitar Summit 2018 – Uli Jon Roth at the Guitar Summit Electric Party 
There were approx. 6,200 visitors. 
The number of stages was supplemented by a "Headphone Stage" in the exhibition area, where the sound was transmitted wirelessly to the headphones of the audience. 
This additional stage increased the number of 30-minute workshops to 160. 
For the first time, master classes were offered separately from the workshops. 
Also new was a do-it-yourself area where attendees could build their own guitar amp with professional instruction. 
In the Guitar and Bass Amplifier area, guitarists and bassists had the opportunity to combine a selection of amplifiers with different cabinets. 
The following artists have been booked for the concert and workshop program of the festival Phil X, Uli Jon Roth, Marcus Deml with his band The Blue Poets, Stu Hamm, Pete Thorn, Sommerplatte with Hanno Busch and Claus Fischer.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Guitar Summit Web Camp 2020 – View behind the scenes 
In 2020, Guitar Summit was not able to take place in its usual format due to the spread of the Corona virus. 
In addition to a virtual tradeshow and on-demand workshop program on virtual stages, the event featured a hosted live stream of several hours of interviews, workshops and product demonstrations. 
In addition, YouTube influencers joined the live stream to help shape the program. 
Attendees were able to interact online with manufacturers, guitar luthiers, artists, the editorial team of German Gitarre&Bass magazine and each other. 
Also in 2021, the Guitar Summit could not take place as usual as due to the pandemic of the Covid 19 virus. A digital event was not possible because of the last-minute cancellation. 
The Guitar Summit is a trade fair for end customers on the topics of guitars, basses, guitar and bass amplifiers and effects devices. 
The event is based on an integrated concept consisting of a festival with live concerts, master classes, workshops and a trade show. 
In addition to workshops and concerts, the Guitar Summit is accompanied by an exhibition where various manufacturers and distributors of stringed instruments showcase their products.

Zur Unsinniade 4. 
Gesang. Aquarell by Ernst Welker (31. Dezember 1817)[1] 
The Unsinnsgesellschaft (Nonsenses Society) was a brotherhood of artists in Vienna that met regularly from April 1817 to the end of 1818. 
Its members included important artists of the Biedermeier period such as August von Kloeber, Johann Nepomuk Hoechle, August Kopisch, Josef and Leopold Kupelwieser and Franz Schubert.[1][2] 
Watercolour by Tobias Raulino (12. Februar 1818).[1][2] 
All booklets are divided into sections:[1] 
Politica or Politisches Allerlei Schöne Literatur: Short stories (f.e. Die Fee Musa oder die verwandelten Jünglinge), short plays (Barbarey ohne Größe oder Mord, Brand, Blut, Dolch und Frevel), poems Wissenschaftliche Gegenstände (Naturgeschichte des Bockes, Abhandlung über die Brüche) Avertissements (in the first year) or Intelligenzblatt (in the second year): Information, Classifieds, Advertisements Zum Kupfer: Description of the illustration (one watercolour or pen and ink drawing each) 
Both lived in the house of Café Wallner at Landstraßer Hauptstraße 32. 
Zur Unsinniade 1. 
Gesang. Aquarell von Carl Friedrich Zimmermann (31. Dezember 1817)-[1] 
The festivities, or already the preparations for them, were announced in the booklets. 
In order to depict these "thrusting" days - as it is formulated in the description of the first feast - for posterity, the members produced the illustrated feast acts, which are now kept in the Historical Museum in Vienna. 
A third (smaller) celebration was the name day of the "Generalquartiermeisterin" (Therese Fellner) on Theresientag (15 October) 1818. 
On this occasion a poem, a drama, a picture and several smaller contributions - almost the entire booklet - were dedicated to her. 
On 3 December 1818, plans were already being made for the next upcoming New Year's Eve celebration. 
Because the last issues are lost, it is not known whether this actually took place.[1] 
Members 
Activities of the Unsinnsgesellschaft 
Johann Carl Smirsch alias Nina Wutzerl.[1] 
The members of the Nonsense Society had aliases within their circle. 
According to Heinrich Anschütz, Franz Schubert was also one of the members of this nonsense society: 
9 Hefte als Digitalisat der Wienbibliothek im Rathaus.[1] Eduard Anschütz (Hrsg.): Archiv des menschlichen Unsinns: Ein langweiliges Unterhaltungsblatt für Wahnwitzige (1818). 
20 Hefte als Digitalisat der Wienbibliothek im Rathaus.[2] Rita Steblin: Die Unsinnsgesellschaft: Franz Schubert, Leopold Kupelwieser und ihr Freundeskreis. 
The members met once a week, on Thursdays, in the inn "Zum rothen Hahn" at Landstraßer Hauptstraße 40 in Vienna.[1] 
1 2 3 Schuberts literarische Heimat: Dichtung und Literatur-Rezeption der Schubert-Freunde. Böhlau. 1999. pp. 80f. 
The handwritten, weekly club magazine Archiv des menschlichen Unsinns - ein langweiliges Unterhaltungsblatt für Wahnwitzige (Archive of Human Nonsense - a boring entertainment magazine for the insane) contained various texts, essays, short plays and illustrations (such as watercolours). 
Because many members were talented painters, the resulting pictures are an important part of the overall artistic production. 
Among other things, they also travesty the academic painting of the time. 
The illustrations of two elaborately designed parties provide insight into the exuberant young artistic community. 
29 booklets (out of 86) have been preserved. 
The texts contain numerous allusions to current affairs, political events, parodies of classics as well as a comic epyllion in elegiac distichs (Die Unsinniade by Joseph Kupelwieser). By means of partly crude jokes, ambiguous puns and metaphors, but also comedies, sarcastic texts and absurdist plays, they mock the private affairs of the association, and topics such as current events, new discoveries, art, literature and everyday life. 
Size, layout and sections 
The booklets - all in the same format with a picture - were passed around the circle.[1] They each start with a witty motto,[2] such as: 
The list of Stolpersteine in Hamburg-Altstadt contains all Stolpersteine laid in Hamburg-Altstadt as part of the art project of the same name by Gunter Demnig. 
They are intended to commemorate victims of National Socialism who lived and worked in Hamburg-Altstadt. 
This page is part of the list of Stolpersteine in Hamburg, since this would be too large with a total of 6463 (as of November 2022)[1] stones and therefore a separate page was created for each district in which stones were laid. 
It bears the inscription 
Footnotes 
The Hirsch Institute for Tropical Medicine is an institute for medical research and training in Asella in the state of Oromia in central Ethiopia. 
It was officially opened in 2013 as a branch of the Clinic for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectiology of the University Hospital Düsseldorf and Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf by Dieter Häussinger, the director of the clinic and the institute. 
With 25 German and Ethiopian staff, it provides a platform for tropical medicine, infectiology, parasitology and hepatology research at an international level, serves to train Ethiopian and German physicians, scientists, medical students and other personnel, and as a base for development cooperations. 
The activities are carried out in close cooperation with the Arsi University in Asella, Ethiopia and the Asella Teaching Hospital, the teaching hospital of the university. 
Others 
In September 2014, Häussinger and his colleagues at the Institute were awarded the Medical Humanitarian Award of the Else Kröner-Fresenius Foundation for their activities in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in the Arsi region of Ethiopia. 
On the initiative of the Tropical Institute, an incinerator for potentially infectious hospital waste was built on the grounds of the hospital in Asella in 2016 by the German organization "Technik ohne Grenzen" (Erlangen chapter). 
Donors such as the Rotary Club Düsseldorf South made it possible to equip the institute with equipment such as the powerful emergency generator or various laboratory devices. 
[1] Homepage der Klinik für Gastroenterologie, Hepatologie und Infektiologie des Universitätsklinikums Düsseldorf Sonderforschungsbereich 974. 
History and origins of the Institute 
The decision to establish the Institute as a branch of the Clinic for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectiology of the University Hospital Düsseldorf on the premises of the Medical Faculty of the Adama Science and Technology University in Asella was taken in 2009. 
During a visit of Dieter Häussinger to Ethiopia, a letter of intent was signed together with the President of the Ethiopian University, Eichele, then Minister of Education of Ethiopia, D. Mekonnen, and the German Vice Ambassador to Ethiopia, M. Biontino. 
The construction of the institute was supported by a donation of Wolfgang Hirsch. 
After the conclusion of a cooperation agreement and a three-year construction phase, the institute was officially opened in 2013. 
After the establishment of the Arsi University in the cities of Asella and Bekoji in 2015 with the connection of the Medical Faculty in Asella, the transfer of the cooperation agreement to this new university took place. 
Asella Teaching Hospital, a hospital affiliated with the medical faculty as a teaching hospital, serves as a regional care center for the Arsi zone, an area with a population of approximately 3.5 million. 
There are specialized departments for internal medicine, gynecology including obstetrics, pediatrics and general surgery, an HIV/AIDS outpatient clinic, and other specialized outpatient clinics. 
The institute was built on the grounds of the Faculty of Medicine and in the immediate vicinity of the Asella Teaching Hospital. 
Building and laboratory equipment 
In the institute, German and Ethiopian scientists and physicians work together. 
The work is supported on site by a team of study nurses, laboratory assistants and administrative assistants. 
The building combines examination rooms, laboratories, a seminar room and offices. 
Equipment includes equipment for clinical examinations such as sonography, elastography, or critical fibrillation frequency analysis, laboratory analyses such as point-of-care diagnostics, hematological, blood chemistry, or molecular biology testing procedures, and various immunological, parasitological, or microbiological examination procedures, including bacterial culture procedures and resistance analysis. 
Safe laboratory work and reliable storage of study samples at -80 °C are made possible by a dedicated water tank and an emergency power supply via diesel generators. 
Two off-road vehicles are available to the institute for field work and supply runs. 
Researches 
The focus of clinical and translational research is in the area of hepatological, infectious and tropical medicine studies. 
Research focuses on chronic liver diseases, tuberculosis, sepsis, antibiotic resistance, intestinal parasitoses in HIV, epidemiology of various infectious diseases and resistance to antiretroviral therapy. 
Teaching 
The Institute provides a platform for the training of Ethiopian and German students, physicians and scientists. 
Medical students, PhD students and physicians from Germany are provided with tropical medicine education and training. 
Through exchange programs, scientific and medical training locally and in Germany, as well as regular practical training and lectures at the Institute and the Faculty of Medicine, the medical and scientific training of Ethiopian academics is promoted. 
In this context, the training of young Ethiopian scientists takes place within the framework of an international PhD program. 
Within the framework of a university and clinic partnership of the ESTHER initiative (Ensemble pour une Solidarité Thérapeutique Hospitalière En Réseau), training and further education in the areas of mother-child health, hospital hygiene and patient safety takes place. 
Feldbahn- und Lokomotivfabrik Smoschewer & Co., Breslau (advertisement, 1923) 
Still known today is Smoschewer's art collection, which included numerous paintings, watercolors and graphics by renowned artists. 
Around 1923, the company manufactured all kinds of light railway materials, such as switches, turntables, tipping wagons, special wagons and all other accessories for light railroads. 
The company had a special interest in light railway operation on farms. 
In this respect, the company owned special constructions, patents, etc. Furthermore, the company supplied all rail material with accessories for the execution of earthworks, for the equipment of small railroads, main railroads, standard-gauge sidings, and also had a special technical office for the design of small and branch railroads. 
Over a long period of time, locomotives of all types were manufactured in the extensive workshops that the company owned in the Wroclaw suburb of Schmiedefeld, both for construction companies and for industrial railroads, for standard-gauge sidings, for small public railroads, state railroads, etc. The company also had a special technical office for the design of small railroads and branch lines. A particular specialty was the production of small railway locomotives and shunting locomotives as well as fireless locomotives. 
The locomotive factory was equipped with the most modern devices and also received orders from foreign railroads. 
Another specialty was formed by the transport equipment department, which manufactured shunting devices (spills). 
These devices found an increasing market in the early 1920s as a result of high wages. 
They were installed on many sidings at home and abroad. 
The company had an extensive domestic and foreign organization, consisting of its own branches, agencies, etc. The company had its own branches in Berlin, Leipzig, Görlitz, Gdansk, Bromberg, Katowice, Prague and Bucharest. 
The main manufacturing plant was located in the Wroclaw suburb of Schmiedefeld, where there was a large locomotive factory and a special light-railway factory for small railroad cars, switches, etc. 
There were also larger workshops in Bromberg, Berlin and Leipzig. 
A total of about 800 workers were employed.[1]

The Smoschewer art collection included numerous paintings, watercolors and graphics. 
Represented were mainly German contemporary painters such as Lovis Corinth, Wilhelm Leibl, Max Liebermann, Max Slevogt, Hans Thoma and Wilhelm Trübner, as well as works by teachers from the Wroclaw Academy of Fine Arts, including Alexander Kanoldt, Konrad von Kardorff, Carlo Mense, Oskar Moll, Hans Purrmann and Max Wislicenus. 
The art collection also included sculptures by August Gaul, Theodor von Gosen and Georg Kolbe. 
Elise Smoschewer was portrayed by Lovis Corinth in 1906. 
In various cases, there have already been disputes about restitution for individual works of art.[1][2]

Leo Smoschewer was a co-owner of Smoschewer & Co. in Breslau, a company founded in 1899 and aryanized in 1938, which manufactured locomotives and wagons for light railroads, road rollers and other machinery. 
The company had branches in Berlin, Gdansk and Prague, as well as in Romania. 
Smoschewer had been Romanian consul general in Wroclaw since 1924. 
In the same year he was also appointed honorary senator of the Technical University of Wroclaw. 
After 1933, the persecution of Jews also affected the Smoschewer family. 
The company was Aryanized in 1938. 
In the course of the Aryanization, the Feldbahnfabrik F. W. Budich emerged from his company in 1938. 
Leo Smoschewer was a son of Emanuel Smoschewer, a grain wholesaler who came to Breslau from Krotoschin, and his wife Henriette Smoschewer née Reich..[1]Together with his wife Elise, he lived in a villa at Lindenallee 12 in Breslau. 
After Leo Smoschewer's death, his widow Elise initially wanted to emigrate to her children living abroad, but committed suicide in May 1939.

Political activities 
In his youth, Bernhard Falk was active in the National Liberal Party. 
In 1918 he became a member of the left-liberal DDP. 
From 1924 to 1932 he was a member of the Prussian Parliament, where he was chairman of the DDP parliamentary group. 
Bernhard Falk was a member of the executive committee of the Prussian Association of Cities and was the managing director of the Cologne synagogue community. 
As a patriotic German Jew, he belonged to the main board of the Central-Verein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens. 
On the occasion of the Cologne Millennium Exhibition in 1925, in the Cologne exhibition halls on the occasion of the "thousand-year affiliation of the Rhineland to the German Reich," Bernhard Falk published the editorial in the CV-Zeitung with the title Der deutsche Jude auf Rheinischer Erde. 
Family 
Bernhard Falk was the son of the butcher Salomon Falk and his wife. 
The family lived in Cologne from 1898. 
The couple had four sons. 
The eldest son Alfred was killed as an air force officer in 1917; the second son Fritz Falk (b. 
Son Ernst H. Falk (b. 
August 26, 1901; d. 
After 1945, the widowed Else Falk moved to her son in Sao Paulo.[1] She died there in January 1956. 
Life and profession 
Bernhard Falk was of Jewish faith and studied law in Bonn and Munich after graduating from the Apostelgymnasium in Cologne in 1885. 
In July 1893, Bernhard Falk was admitted to the bar at the District and Regional Court in Elberfeld and the Chamber for Commercial Matters in Barmen. 
On May 1, 1898, he moved to the Higher Regional Court in Cologne. 
During World War I, he was a captain in the Landwehr and for one year was adjutant to the district chief of Bastogne. 
In 1912 he was awarded the title of judicial councilor. 
After the seizure of power by the National Socialists and the law on the admission to the bar of April 7, 1933, Bernhard Falk was only able to remain in his profession after two petitions (on April 8 and May 3, 1933) as a former front-line fighter and father of a son killed in the World War. 
During the "Reichspogromnacht" his apartment was vandalized by SA men. 
After that, Bernhard Falk was forced to leave Germany. 
In April 1939 he emigrated with his wife to Brussels. 
There they found refuge with a judge and officer friend from Cologne at Rue Beffrai 41. 
Emigration to Switzerland was prevented by Berlin authorities.[1] Bernhard Falk died in Brussels on December 23, 1944. 
In Cologne-Longerich, Bernhard Falk Street was named after him on April 14, 1957. 
On October 5, 2020, Gunter Demnig laid stumbling blocks in front of the Falk family's longtime residence in Cologne-Bayenthal - initiated by the Rhineland-Cologne section of the German Alpine Club - in memory of Bernhard Falk, his wife Else and his son Ernst Hermann.[1]

Considered media-shy, Stefanini's last public appearance took place in March 2014 at a vernissage of the Kunstmuseum Bern. 
From 1930 to 1957, his father ran the Salmen restaurant on Marktgasse in Winterthur, which belonged to a cooperative of Italian industrial workers. 
In the building next door, at Marktgasse 47, Stefanini set up his real estate company Terresta AG. 
As a "secondo" he passed the entrance examination to the ETH Zurich, completed recruit school and served in the army up to the rank of captain. 
He abandoned his studies in natural sciences in favor of a career in the real estate industry. 
Stefanini owned many properties in the city; for example, he is said to have owned half of Steinberggasse in Winterthur's old town. 
He also owned the Sulzer high-rise building. 
Because he let his properties fall into disrepair, he repeatedly made the headlines for his unwillingness to cooperate with the city of Winterthur. 
In 2009, the city had two properties on Steinberggasse scaffolded because of danger to passers-by. 
His castles, including Salenstein Castle, also fell into disrepair, leading to media reports.[1] In 2010, he wanted to have the tenants measure the apartments themselves, since he apparently did not have this information.[2] 
He had transferred most of his assets to his foundation, which he set up in 1980. 
Foundation for Art, Culture and History 
Stefanini invested a large part of his fortune in art, which he managed in his Foundation for Art, Culture and History. 
It is one of the most important private art collections in Switzerland and includes four castles, numerous works of art and other curiosities. 
Among others, the foundation owns works of art by important artists such as Ferdinand Hodler, Albert Anker, Giovanni Giacometti, Alberto Giacometti, Giovanni Segantini and Felix Vallotton. 
Notable women artists in the collection include Angelika Kauffmann, Ottilie Roederstein, Alice Bailly, Helen Dahm, Meret Oppenheim and Niki de Saint Phalle. 
The four castles of Grandson on Lake Neuchâtel, Luxburg and Salenstein in Thurgau, and Brestenberg in Aargau also belong to the foundation. 
He owed the Rolls-Royce von Joe Carstairs[1], Deathbed and will of Napoleon Bonaparte, Officer cap, coat, dagger and pocket watch von General Guisan[2], a dress of Kaiserin «Sisi», a dish of John F. Kennedy, auf dem 1963 der Atomwaffensperrvertrag unterzeichnet wurde, sowie ein Tresor von Albert Einstein. 
Only a small part of this collection is open to the public. 
The value of the entire collection is estimated at over 1.5 billion Swiss francs, the objects at approximately 34,000 pieces..[3] 
Since an attempted amendment of the Articles of Association in February 2014, there had been a dispute between the family members and the Foundation Board. 
On December 17, 2014, the descendants Bettina and Vital Stefanini appointed a new Board of Trustees before the expiry of the term of office of the Board of Trustees elected by founder Bruno Stefanini. 
They had themselves and three other new members entered in the Commercial Register and deleted the old ones, including their father Bruno Stefanini. 
This prompted the supervisory authority to intervene by means of a superprovisional injunction.[1] Die Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht machte den Schritt der Nachkommen rückgängig und setzte den vom Stifter gewählten Stiftungsrat wieder ein. 
Life and Career 
Biography 
Like most Jewish women's rights activists, Rosa Dalberg came from a family of the Jewish assimilated bourgeoisie. 
Striving for recognition, Jewish girls were often obliged to adhere to bourgeois norms even more than non-Jewish girls and were generally not allowed to take up a profession, which is why many became involved in the bourgeois women's movement.[1] 
In 1896, Rosa Dalberg married the lawyer Max Bodenheimer from Cologne, a convinced Zionist. 
Bodenheimer later recalled their meeting: "I talked about Zionism, and Fräulein Dalberg turned out to be a women's rights activist. 
Both ideals sprang from the same feeling for justice and the same urge for freedom. 
The lively spirit, the interest in art, and her feeling for the oppressed attracted me powerfully." The couple had three children in quick succession, daughters Henriette and Ruth and son Friedrich Simon Bodenheimer. 
In 1931, the family lived at Belfortstraße 9; father Max and daughter Ruth had a joint law office in the house at Hohenzollernring 74[1][2] 
After the births of her children, Rosa Bodenheimer began to become involved in the Cologne women's movement and became one of its most prominent representatives. 
Admittedly, she mainly felt more German than "Jewish": "She wanted to implement her ideas of social reform and political and social equality for women for all women." On the other hand, she was confronted with growing anti-Semitism in Germany, so that after the 1907 Zionist Congress in The Hague, at a time when many Jewish women still rejected Zionism, she initiated the founding of the Association of Jewish Women for Cultural Work in Palestine, forerunner of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO).[1] 
The work of the ADF differed fundamentally from the charitable work of earlier associations in the 19th century: "Social activity has become a civic aid activity that ultimately searches for the causes of misery and wants to eliminate these causes.“[1] 
Bodenheimer represented moderate feminist positions. 
She assumed a difference in essence between men and women and emphasized the woman's task as "bodily and social mother".[1] The work of the ADF awakened many women's interest in local politics and subsequently in women's suffrage. 
After Rosa Bodenheimer heard a lecture by Marie Stritt, chairwoman of the Federation of German Women's Associations, in 1907, she participated in the founding of a Cologne suffrage group that same year. 
The Women's Suffrage Association for West Germany was initially limited to preparing women for politics; Bodenheimer, meanwhile, called for a major advertising campaign for women's suffrage in 1912, with which she was unable to prevail. 
In 1919, women were able to participate in the election to the National Assembly for the first time, but Bodenheimer had to realize in the following years that this did not mean any significant social improvement for them..[1] 
During World War I, Bodenheimer was a board member of the National Women's Movement. 
She received a Cross of Merit for this commitment to war relief. 
In 1922, together with Adele Meurer, she founded Das Lädchen in Cologne, a sales agency for the impoverished due to war and inflation..[1] 
Increasing anti-Semitism soon directed the attention of Rosa Bodenheimer and other committed Jewish women to other issues. 
Soon after the National Socialists seized power, the Bodenheimer family thought about emigration. 
After her daughter Ruth had narrowly escaped an attack on Jewish lawyers on March 31, 1933, the family fled to Palestine via Antwerp and Amsterdam in April. 
There Rosa Bodenheimer made contact with the women's suffrage movement and agitated against gender injustice in the Talmud.[1] In 1938 she died after a short serious illness in Jerusalem.[2] 
An incident longitudinal wave (L1) is reflected and transmitted at an interface of two solids as a longitudinal wave (L1' and L2), but also partially as a transverse wave (S1 and S2). 
Mode conversion is the splitting of an incident wave at an interface into other wave types (modes). 
In seismology awave conversion specifically refers to the conversion between P and S waves at discontinuities.[1] Space waves are reflected and refracted when they hit a boundary layer within the earth. 
Here, P-waves can be converted into S-waves (PS-wave) at interfaces, as well as vice versa (SP-wave).[2] Here applies analogously for an incident P-wave: 
Waves.

KIT. 
Principle 
Mode conversion occurs when a wave encounters an interface between materials of different impedances and the incident angle is not normal to the interface.[1] Thus, for example, if a longitudinal wave from a fluid (e.g., water or air) strikes a solid (e.g., steel plate), it is usually refracted and reflected as a function of the angle of incidence, but if some of the energy causes particle movement in the transverse direction, a second transverse wave is generated, which can also be refracted and reflected. Snellius' law of refraction can be formulated as:[1] sin ⁡ θ 1 V L 1 = sin ⁡ θ 2 V L 2 = sin ⁡ θ 3 V S 1 = sin ⁡ θ 4 V S 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {\sin {\theta }_{1}}{{V}_{L1}}}={\frac {\sin {\theta }_{2}}{{V}_{L2}}}={\frac {\sin {\theta }_{3}}{{V}_{S1}}}={\frac {\sin {\theta }_{4}}{{V}_{S2}}}} 
This means that the incident wave is split into two different wave types at the interface. 
If we consider a wave incident on an interface of two different solids (e.g. aluminum and steel), the wave type of the reflected wave also splits. 
Besides these simple mode conversions, an incident wave can also be converted into surface waves. 
For example, if one radiates a longitudinal wave at a shallower angle than that of total reflection onto a boundary surface, it will be totally reflected, but in addition a surface wave traveling along the boundary layer will be generated. 
The incident wave is thus converted into reflected longitudinal and surface wave. 
In general, mode conversions are not discrete processes, i.e. a part of the incident energy is converted into different types of waves. 
The amplitudes (transmission factor, reflection factor) of the converted waves depend on the angle of incidence.[1] 
Seismic Waves 
Main article: Converted-wave analysis An (longitudinal) P-wave is partially reflected and transmitted (PSt and PPt) as a (transverse) S-wave (PSr) and (longitudinal) P-wave (PPr). 
The nomenclature is as follows: First letter stands for the wave type of the causal wave (primary wave) and the second letter for the type of secondary waves generated after mode conversion.

Helene Hecht, who was considered to be very educated and culturally engaged in many ways, led together with Berta Hirsch (1850-1913),[1][2] who was also the founder of the first reading hall in Germany,[3] the largest salon in the city of Mannheim. 
In this salon, the two ladies facilitated communication between artists and notable citizens and at the same time opened a way for patrons to promote these artists.[4] 
Franz Josef Kampichler (* 27. June 1947 in Vienna) is a former Austrian polititian (ÖVP). 
Kampichler was Member of the National Council between the years 1985 and 2002. 
Since 2013 he heads the organisation "Association of Public Mandataries and Functionaries".

After completing compulsory school, Kampicher attended the commercial vocational school in Wiener Neustadt and Theresienfeld between 1961 and 1964. 
1967 he completed the mandatory military service. 
Kampichler worked as Store Manager of the company "Josef Kampichler" and was Vendor in 1961 und 1964 at the company "Kortmann und Schulte" in Vienna. 
In addition Kampichler worked as an Acquisitor at the company "Walter Bösch KG" in Lustenau.[1] 
Politics 
Er war auch Schulobmann der Volks- und Hauptschulgemeinde Edlitz[1]. 
Since the 29. October 1991 he was National Chairman Deputy of the Association "Rettet das Kind"[1]. 
Nach seiner Niederlage bei der Bürgermeisterwahl 2002 stellte Kampichler seine politische Funktion in Frage. Eine Bürgerliste, auf der die gesamte Gemeindeverwaltung kandidierte, hatte die absolute Mehrheit errungen und Kampichler eine schwere Niederlage zugefügt.[1] Nachdem der Niederösterreichische ÖAAB nicht ihm, sondern dem Wiener Neustädter Bezirksparteiobmann Johann Rädler die Zustimmung zugesagt hatte, verzichtete Kampichler auch auf eine Kandidatur an zweiter Stelle der Regionalwahlkreisliste. 
Zudem legte er in der Folge nach 20 Jahren seine Funktion als ÖAAB-Bezirksobmann zurück.[2] 
Seit dem 5. März 2013 ist Kampichler Bundesvorsitzender der Vereinigung öffentlicher Mandatare und Funktionäre[1].

Berta Eberstadt came from the well-known Worms Jewish family of Falck Ferdinand Eberstadt (* Worms 1808, † Mannheim 1888). 
He was a textile merchant and an active participant in the revolution of 1848. 
From 1849 to 1852 he was the first Jew in Germany to be appointed mayor of Worms. 
For political and family reasons, he moved with his ten children to liberal Mannheim from December 5, 1857. 
There he founded the "Firma Ferd. 
Eberstadt und Cie." Art and culture became an important part of his life within the better Jewish society, into which his daughters married. 
Her social salon, which she maintained with Helene Hecht, was frequented by artists and politicians, such as Ludwig Frank, Hedwig Wachenheim, Theodor Heuss and Friedrich Naumann, who called her "Frau Kultur" in an obituary. 
She developed her activities in the spirit of the women's movement of the time, which was founded as an association in Berlin in 1896, today "Deutscher Verband Frau und Kultur" with 30 local groups. 
Emma Eberstadt (1840-1906), the sister, was married to Bernhard Kahn. 
This institution was supported by Bertha Hirsch. 
Berta Hirsch was cremated in the Christian cemetery. 
The city of Mannheim honored her with the name of the elementary school "Bertha-Hirsch-Schule" in Mannheim-Käfertal.

Controversies 
Die Deutsche Frühstücksei versprach eine schnelle Aufklärung der Unregelmäßigkeiten.[2][3] 
The company was repeatedly criticized because of harmful substances in eggs and animal cruelty. 
In der Folge kam es zu Betriebs-Sperrung und Rücknahmen von Eiern.[1] 
Dies habe auch mit Fipronil belastete Eier betroffen.[1] 
2015 veröffentlichte die Tierschutzorganisation Animal Equality Aufnahmen aus Bio-Legehennen-Ställen der Bio-Geflügelhof Mühlenberg/Dranse GmbH,[1] einer Tochter der Deutschen Frühstücksei. Animal Equality kritisierte, dass nicht die Bedürfnisse der Tiere, sondern das Interesse der Betreiber nach größtmöglichem Profit an erster Stelle stünden. 
Die Landtagsfraktion der Partei Bündnis 90/Die Grünen Brandenburg bezeichnete die Bilder als schockierend und stellte eine Kleine Anfrage im Landtag Brandenburg.[2] 
Die Zeit berichtete von der Recherche mit Fotomaterial, Animal Rights Watch veröffentlichte Foto- und Videomaterial.[4][5] 
Der Betrieb gehört dem ökologischen Anbauverband Verbund Ökohöfe an, einer der 15 Mitgliederverbände des Bundes Ökologische Lebensmittelwirtschaft.[1][2] Laut ARIWA zeigten die Aufnahmen die Realität hinter der Werbelüge von der "artgerechten Tierhaltung" bei Bio-Erzeugerverbänden,[3] die Zeit bezeichnete die Haltungsbedingungen als Bruch des Versprechens an die Kundinnen und Kunden.[4]

In the finale, they received 92.77% of the audience's vote for their version of Stay. She got to know her early band manager Nik Hafermann through the show. 
The band had a few appearances in smaller clubs, but the group disbanded shortly thereafter. 
Leonie performed as a solo artist from then on, using a slightly modified spelling of her first name as her stage name. 
In 2016, Leony signed with Sony Music in Australia, subsequently undertaking a lot of vocal coaching. 
Her first songs were produced in Sweden, with her releasing her first debut single Surrender in 2017. 
The song was used in a Sylvie Meis underwear collection commercial. The single Boots was released in 2018, with More Than Friends following in 2019. 
Thereafter, she moved over to a different brand, with Vitali Zestovskih and Mark Becker becoming her new managers and producers. 
Together with DJ duo Vize and Sam Feldt she released her new single Far Away from Home. 
Her breakthrough came in July 2020 with her remake of Modern Talking's song Brother Louie in collaboration with Vize, Kazakh artist Imanbek and the former Modern Talking member, Dieter Bohlen. 
In 2022, she was a music mentor for Emilia and her song Outside and Inside in Dein Song, a reality television music competition on German broadcaster ZDF. 
In 2023, Leony featured as a judge on the 20th season of German reality talent show Deutschland sucht den Superstar. 
Personal Life 
Her brother is the professional football player Korbinian Burger. Leony lives in Berlin. 
It is said that this ceremony is related to the Shikinensai, the commemoration of the anniversary of the death of a historical emperor. In addition to the shrines at Ise and Sumiyoshi, such ceremonies were once held at other shrines, including the Katori-jingū, the Kashima-jingū, the Usa-jingū, the Kasuga-taisha, and the Suwa-taisha (the Onbashira-sai). The term Sengū is used only for the sanctuary of a Shintō shrine; another term is used for the procession of the imperial palace, a Buddhist temple, or a statue of Buddha: Senza (遷座). 
Coat of arms of the House von der Osten 
The House von der Osten [ ˈoːstən ] refers to an old and distinguished noble family from Pomerania that has been established in Pomerania since 1248, originally from Stift Bremen. 
The family's ancestral home is in Lower Saxony, near the Oste River. The family acquired numerous properties in Western and Eastern Pomerania, becoming one of the largest landowners in Pomerania.[1] In 1854, the Osten were one of the first ten families to hold the hereditary right of presentation to the Prussian House of Lords.[2] 
The ruins of the castle tower of House Demmin. 
Sir Ulricus de Osten was documented from 1243 to 1255 as the princely Pomeranian bailiff in Demmin. 
In his capacity as such, he transferred four hides in Wittenwerder to the Dargun monastery. 
His sons Arnold, Hermann, and Otto were also mentioned as knights and castle men at the princely Castle Haus Demmin between 1271 and 1322. 
The ducal line of Pomerania-Demmin had already died out in 1264 and the rule had fallen to the Dukes of Pomerania-Stettin, which is why the bailiffs now acted alone on the castle. 
Hennecke, Arnold's son, was referred to as the ducal-Pomeranian castle man at Lindenberg Castle near Upost from 1319 to 1363. 
Arnold Jr., Otto's son, was also a knight and castle man in Demmin from 1303 to 1315. 
Wedige, Hermann's son, was referred to as the bailiff in Demmin, sitting on the Osten Castle near Demmin. 
He was thus the first of the Ostens on this castle, from which he probably gave his name.[1] The Osten Castle was probably built in the early 13th century. 
After the Thirty Years War, the castle was demolished. 
Landed nobility in Pomerania 
In 1303, Hynricus and Bernardus de Osten were referred to as vassals of the prince of Werle (according to Schwarz). 
This suggests that they had moved from Pomerania to Mecklenburg to serve Werle. 
Later, Fredericus de Osten miles dictus de Woldenborch, sat in Pyritz on Woldenburg, in the Regenwalde district (today Dąbie). 
With both brothers and their descendants, the Ostens belonged to the castle- or manor-sitted families in the Duchy of Pomerania.[1] The family continued to spread to the Neumark, Poland and Denmark, later to Prussia and Bavaria. 
Map of the Duchy of Hinterpommern with the Osten District (in the eastern center) 
In 1367, the Ostens bought the lordship of Plathe in Hinterpommern from the Wedells. 
In 1577, Wedige von der Osten was forced to sell the old family castle and a part of the city to Hermann von Blücher. 
The Ostens then built a new castle a few hundred meters away, which belonged to the family until they were expelled in 1945. 
However, the current "New Castle" is only a building from the early 20th century, except for a side wing. 
From the 17th century to 1817, there was the Osten- and Blücher circle around Plathe, so named because of the two families with the largest property. 
The circle was now called the "Osten Circle" and covered 37,750 hectares.[2] 
In addition to other holdings, the von der Osten family also had larger holdings on the island of Rügen, including Gut Kapelle near Gingst and Gut Lipsitz near Bergen on Rügen (1603 to 1730). 
In 1763, Heinrich Karl von der Osten acquired Gut Blumberg from his father-in-law and uncle from the von Sydow family. 
His son Karl von der Osten built the manor house in 1792. 
In 1898, the 2,500-hectare estate passed to Friedrich Wilhelm von der Osten on Penkun. 
Henning von der Osten was expropriated in 1945 during land reform. 
In 1996, his three sons were able to regain the estate house with courtyard and park, and in 1997, the majority of the Blumberger forest from the state and take over its management. 
Von der Osten-Sacken [ ˈoːstən ] is the name of a German-Baltic noble family that has been settled in the Baltic region since the 13th century. 
Arnoldus dictus Lyndale was enfeoffed with Sacken by Bishop Otto of Courland in 1386 and appeared as Arnoldus de Sacken in 1395. 
Sander von Sacken, known as von der Oest, first appeared with the combined name in 1544, which later became Osten-Sacken and led to the unification of the coats of arms with the von der Ostens, although no evidence of a common ancestry between the two families has been found. 
The Osten-Sackens produced numerous officers and diplomats of the Russian tsarist empire. 
Other branches became landowners through marriage in West Germany, such as in 1974 at Bassenheim Castle (which made the branch of the barons of Waldthausen-Osten a member of the Rhenish Knights), and in 1978 at the Edelhof Ricklingen in Hanover. 
In the registration book of the Dobbertin monastery, there are six entries from daughters of the von der Osten families from Karstorf and Plathe from 1713 to 1866 for admission to the noble ladies' convent. 
The family of von der Osten, also known as Sacken, spread in the Baltic region since the 13th century. 
It belongs to the Baltic nobility and traces its roots back to Arnoldus dictus Lyndale, who was granted Haus and Gebiet Sacken (later the Kirchspiel Sacken) by Bishop Otto of Kurland in 1386. 
In 1395, he is documented as Arnoldus de Sacken with the granting of Erkuln and Goldingen. 
The Sackens were wealthy large landowners, primarily in the Livonian and Courland Knighthood. 
Sander von Sacken, also known as von der Oest, first appears with the combined name in 1544, which later led to the name and coat of arms unification of the two families as von der Osten gen. 
Sacken, without a tribal connection being able to be proven.[1][2] As the Osten-Sackens had a well-known name in Russia, for example, Ludwig von der Osten from Pomerania, who served as an officer in Russian services, made use of their name. 
Castle Dondangen (Dundaga) 
The Osten-Sacken holdings included Appricken (Apriķi) and Paddern in the Hasenpoth district; Dondangen, Groß- and Klein-Bathen, Lehnen, Pilten, Sareicken and Sackenmünde in the Duchy of Kurland and Semgallen; Schnepeln, Suhr, Seemuppen, Pewicken, Pelzen (all in Kurland). 
Dondangen was initially owned by Diedrich von Maydell, who was married to Anna Sibylla von der Osten-Sacken. 
As the marriage was childless, the widow passed on the estate to her nephew Prince Carl Prince von der Osten gen. 
In 1917, Livland ceded its Estonian part to Estonia, but in return, it was incorporated into Kurland in the south. 
As a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the independent republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania emerged in 1918. 
The Latvian War of Independence against Soviet Russia was supported by Estonians and German-Baltics (Baltic Landeswehr, Iron Division), followed by a failed coup attempt by the German-Baltic minority, and then a Latvian government, which expropriated the German-Baltic large landowners through the Latvian land reform of 1919/1920, leading to the emigration of many German-Baltics, including many members of the Osten-Sacken family, to the Reich. 
Paul Freiherr von der Osten-Sacken returned to Kurland in 1924. 
Noble elevation 
Several elevations have taken place, including the elevation to the rank of baron, Reichgraf, Prussian, Polish, and Russian count, and prince.[1] The following probands are merely selected individual examples: 
Karl Ludwig August Franz von der Osten was elevated to the rank of Prussian count in 1888 in connection with the ownership of Plathe.[1] 
King Friedrich Wilhelm IV granted the family the right to present themselves to the Prussian House of Lords in 1855. 
The family was thus one of the ten families that received this right during the early phase of the House of Lords in 1854/1855. 
On presentation of the association of the Pomeranian noble family of von der Osten, members of the family sat in the House of Lords: 
The coat of arms of the Osten family is divided. 
On the right it shows three diagonal silver wave bars in blue and on the left, in red, a vertically standing silver key with its handle facing to the left. 
The wave bars are meant to symbolize the Oste river (according to another view, the three Elbe tributaries Oste, Lühe and Schwinge), and the upright key represents the Archdiocese of Bremen.[1] On the helmet in the black open eagle flight are two crossed golden keys in front of a column adorned with three peacock feathers and adorned with a silver star. 
The helmet covers are silver-red on the right and silver-blue on the left. 
The coat of arms of the von Sacken family, later von der Osten-Sacken, shows three six-pointed golden stars (2:1) on a blue background; later quartered with the coat of arms of the von der Osten. 
For the Prussian princely coat of arms: the quartered coat of arms with princely hat as the main shield on a quartered coat of arms with a black Prussian eagle on a silver ground (1), a golden lion on a red ground (2 and 3), and a black eagle on a golden ground (4). 
For the Russian princely coat of arms: the main coats of arms of Osten and Sacken quartered, with a black double-headed eagle on gold in the main shield.

They were last mentioned in their original homeland in 1426 with Hermann III., Burgmann of Horneburg.[3] 
The noble family from Lower Saxony spread to Holstein, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and the Principality of Rügen. 
Between 1285 and 1456, the Ostens held the office of Landvogt of Rügen, the highest office of the principality, seven times. 
The brothers Ulrich and Friedrich ("Olricus advocatus Dyminensis et dominus Fredericus frater ipsius") appear in a document in November 1248 in Demmin.[1]

Haeva is a Germanic goddess, whose name is only attested today on a now-lost votive inscription found in Gelderland, the Netherlands. On this stone, she is called upon alongside Hercules Magusanus. „Hercvli Magvsano et Haevae Vlpi(vs) Lvpio et Vlpia Ammava pro natis v(otum) s(olverunt) l(ibentes) m(erito)“ This spelling of her name could read as equivalent to the Greek goddess Hebe, wife of Hercules. With the context of Hercules Magusanus, a syncretism between the Germanic god Donar and the Greco-Roman Hercules, a Germanic origin of Haeva's name can also be assumed.

Website Rufina Bazlova The History of Belarusian Vyzhyvanka Projekt Framed in Belarus 
Rufina Bazlova comes from the large city of Grodno in western Belarus. 
She studied in Plzeň and has worked in Prague as a set designer and performance artist. 
She received her master's diploma in illustration and graphic design from the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen in 2015. 
Bazlova moved to Prague and completed a bachelor's degree in scenography at the Academy of Performing Arts in 2020.[1] 
In August 2020, thousands of people joined the protests against Alexander Lukashenko's election, including many artists. 
In response to the Belarusian election campaign, Rufina Bazlova designed the first protest embroideries and posted her work on Instagram. 
Bazlova uses traditional Belarusian embroidery to create critical. 
The figures, which look like pictograms, are in the national colors of white and red of the Belarusian opposition. 
The technique of applying red thread to white fabric with cross stitching invokes the Vyshyvanka technique, a local folklore.[1] The embroideries, which at first seem harmless, become digital narratives and thus a testimony to the Belarusian mass protests.[2] 
Since the early Middle Ages, Vyshyvanka, the East Slavic patterns in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, have been embroidered on clothing. 
Motifs of that time were about love, the sun or protection against evil spirits. 
Bazlova's depictions include tanks, helicopters, fleeing people and swastikas and cockroaches dumping trucks. 
Among protesters in Belarus, the cockroach symbol is code for President Alexander Lukashenko, who has brutally quelled mass protests since the allegedly rigged presidential election in August 2020. 
Bazlova's art provides insight into the female-driven democratic resistance in Belarus. [1] 
Rufina Bazlova creates her designs digitally; very few motifs are actually produced, as production would be too time-consuming. 
The digitally processed Vyshyvanka document the ongoing history of the Belarusian uprising. 
According to Bazlova, each tableau is associated with an actual event from 2020. 
Her Serie The History of Belarusian Vyzhyvanka has become international notoriety; Vyzhyvanka is a play on words from the Belarusian words "embroidery" and "survival." 
Vyshyvanka means "embroidered shirt." 
Vyzhyvats means "survival".[1] In the embroidered comic Zhenokol (Feminnature) Rufina Bazlova presented themes on feminism in folk tradition.[2][3] 
The original background was that women who made traditional Belarusian ornaments could neither read nor write. 
Embroidery was the only way to represent their life, their surroundings. 
They created special geometric signs and used mainly red color as a symbol of blood and life on the pure linen background, which symbolized freedom and purity. 
Belarusian ornaments are in a way a code for our national history, which could be read as a text. — Rufina Bazlova 
Together with Sofia Tocar, Bazlova founded Framed in Belarus, a social art project that addresses the situation of political prisoners.[1] On the occasion of the Charlemagne Prize award in 2022 Rufina Bazlova exhibited current works in Aachen.[2] 
Bernd Mazagg (* 1977 in Bregenz) is an Austrian recording and mixing engineer. 
Through his work at Synchron Stage Vienna, he has worked on blockbusters such as Inferno, Pacific Rim: Uprising, Ghost In The Shell and with well-known film music composers such as Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams, Bear McCreary and others.[1] 
As a self-employed sound engineer, he also has a track record of live and studio productions with Austrian bands such as L'Âme Immortelle, Zweitfrau or the Italian rock band Dope Stars Inc. 
Mazagg lives in Bad Vöslau with his wife Verena, and their children. 
Planning the Synchron Stage Vienna 
In 2013, the Vienna Symphonic Library took over the historic, landmarked "Synchronhalle" on the grounds of the Rosenhügel film studios of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation. The hall, which dates back to the 1940s, was converted into a globally unique music production facility, in collaboration with the renowned Walters-Storyk Design Group and architects Schneider+Schumacher. 
As the future "Technical Director", Mazagg was co-responsible for the technical planning, design and execution. 
For the acoustic construction, he worked together with the Lower Austrian company Team-Löffler.[1] While the large recording hall, "Stage A", was brought closer to its original state, the small recording hall, "Stage B", was newly designed.[2] Mazagg created the monitoring solution together with the Berlin-based company ADAM Audio[3], and commissioned Solid State Logic for the mixing consoles. 
He had the same consoles (SSL Duality δelta Pro Station consoles and SSL L500) installed in both Control Rooms A and B so that projects could be seamlessly switched between the rooms.[4] He was also responsible for deciding which microphones to equip the Synchron Stage Vienna with. 
The collection he has built now consists of more than 220 microphones from AEA, AKG, DPA, Flea, Neumann, Royer, Schoeps, Sennheiser and others.[5][6] He also ensured that every room within the building was connected to an analogue plus a high-capacity, redundant Dante network. 
That allows any audio channel to be available in any space.[7] 
Since the hall's opening in 2016, Mazagg has regularly been in charge of music recordings for international film and series productions. 
In 2022, composer Thomas Wander returned to Vienna for the second time to work with Mazagg on the music for Roland Emmerich's blockbuster Moonfall. "The basic sound that Bernd creates here is already great!" His mixes and "the way he positions his microphones" make the source material so good "that you only have to change marginal things".[1]

Nadine Hwang, or Nadine Huong (Chinese 黃訥亭)[1]; (March 3rd 1902–1972) was one of the first Chinese female pilots and served in the Chinese Air Force as an honorary colonel. 
The lawyer used diplomatic skills and her versatile abilities to live in different countries. 
She was mistress of Natalie Clifford Barney and survived deportation to Ravensbrück concentration camp. 
Even as a girl, Nadine Hwang tried to escape the bonds of convention and gender roles.[1] She learned to drive a car and fly small planes at a very early age. "Everything fascinates me about these Western mechanics," she confided to an Excelsior journalist in 1928. "I would love to sit on a locomotive and drive a train at full steam". 
She liked to wear men's clothes, whether for sports or for a party, where, for example, she would appear in traditional Aragonese costume to dance the Aragonese Jota with a female rider.[2] Japanese-American artist and designer Isamu Noguchi recalled meeting a "beautiful lieutenant in the army of the young Marshal Chang Hsueh-Liang" in 1930. 
He described her as "piratical." 
She learned sports such as polo, cricket, and riding. Unthinkable to the average Chinese women of her time. 
Not long ago, Chinese women had been freed from the thousand-year-old tradition of foot binding.[3] 
Career in China 
Zhang Zongchang was the first warlord to accept women into his army. 
When he met Nadine Hwang, he decided to make her a colonel in the Air Force and insisted that she wear short hair and a uniform. 
Although her rank as colonel was apparently only an honorary rank, Nadine was nevertheless given a position of trust as a staff liaison officer. 
It was during this time that she earned her nickname, "the Amazon of the North."[1] 
Nadine Hwang was stationed as a lieutenant in the Chinese army under Marshal Chang Hsueh-Liang from 1929. 
She later obtained an important economic position in the Chinese Beiyang government and worked as a confidential secretary to Prime Minister Pan Fu.[1] She had previously worked for him as a press officer since 1927.[2] 
The modernization of Republican China under Nationalist rule in the early 1930s was threatened by domestic unrest and an increasingly aggressive Imperial Japan, so Hwang could never live the life she wanted in China. 
In 1933, she moved to Paris, where she indulged in the bohemian life.[1] Traveling to the USA[2] and through Europe, she lectured about her country and diplomatically advocated for greater economic exchange. 
Paris 
At the beginning of the 1930s, Nadine Hwang moved to Paris, occasionally took on the role of chauffeur for Natalie Clifford Barney and became her lover. 
Barney regularly hosted literary salons (Le salon de l'Amazone), where cosmopolitan, avant-garde Paris mostly met in her Temple of Friendship (French: Le Temple de l'Amitié). 
Hwang enjoyed the bohemian lifestyle that the Parisian capital offered her. 
In one account of this particular period of Parisian history, she is described as a "piratical" Asian beauty, while in another account she is described as a transvestite.[1] 
Barney's salon gathered a large group of intellectuals and artists from all over the world, including many leading figures of French literature as well as American and British modernists, the so-called Lost Generation of the early 20th century. 
There is evidence to suggest that Nadine Hwang also spied against the Nazis as an agent on behalf of the French Resistance.[1] According to a description in the writings of Helene Nera, Hwang suffered from suffocating racism due to her Chinese identity and jealousies among Barney's many lovers and admirers.[1] 
In 1940, all of Europe was overshadowed by the Nazi influence, Natalie Barney fled the German invasion to Florence.[1] Nadine Hwang was deported to the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp in 1944 for reasons as yet unknown, shortly before the liberation of large parts of France by the Allies.[2] 
On May 13, 1944, the transport left the Gare de l'Est in Paris. 
Four days later, the 567 women arrived at Fürstenberg train station. 
She had to do forced labor at Siemens and became friends with Rachel Krausz and her nine-year-old daughter Irene Krausz, both British citizens who had lived in the Netherlands.[1] „My mother and Nadine shared a love of poetry“,reported Irene Fainman-Krausz, who lives in South Africa as of 2018. 
To remember Nadine Hwang - after all, she helped her and her mother survive - Irene gave her daughter, who was born in 1971 - just one year after Hwang's death - the first name Nadine.[2] 
Nelly Mousset-Vos 
On Christmas Eve 1944, Nelly Mousset-Vos was asked to sing Christmas carols in the barracks with French prisoners. 
After a few songs, a voice called out, "Sing something from Madame Butterfly!" Mousset-Vos sang Un bel dì vedremo, about waiting for a loved one. 
Nadine Hwang, who had asked for the song, stayed connected to Mousset-Vos from that moment on. 
They became a couple and spent as much time together as possible. 
Nelly Mousset-Vos's diary entries reveal that it was thanks to her meeting with Nadine Hwang and through this love affair that she was able to survive the horrors of concentration camps. 
Nelly Mousset-Vos had worked as a courier in the Belgian resistance against the Nazis.[1] 
They were separated in March 1945, when Nelly Mousset-Vos was deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp, where she almost died.[1] In April 1945, shortly before the liberation of the camp, Nadine Hwang, Irene and Rachel, along with thousands of other prisoners, were evacuated to Sweden on Red Cross white buses. 
Their arrival in Malmö on April 28 was documented by Swedish news photographers.[1] 
After the war 
In 1945, Nadine Hwang moved to Brussels via Sweden and began living together with Nelly Mousset-Vos in a lesbian relationship. 
They left Europe soon after to start a new life in Venezuela. 
They posed as cousins and lived together in Caracas for two decades. 
Nelly Mousset-Vos had previously worked at the Venezuelan embassy in Brussels[1] and Hwang worked in the secretariat of a bank in Caracas. 
Their apartment was a popular meeting place for friends and acquaintances. 
Early Years 
Due to an illness, Hwang was forced to take strong medication and she suffered a stroke before the treatment was completed. 
Due to Nadine Hwang's deteriorating health, the couple returned to Europe in the late 1960s.[1] 
Nadine Hwang died in 1972, Nelly Mousset-Vos in 1985, and they are buried in different graves in Brussels.[1] 
Films 
Magnus Gertten realized a trilogy of documentaries between 2011 and 2022, which also deals with the life of Nadine Hwang: 
Nadine Hwang was born in Madrid, her mother Juliette Brouta-Gilliard came from Belgium. 
Her father, Lühe Hwang, came from an influential Chinese family, was a diplomat and high official. 
A few months later, the whole family returned to Madrid, where Lühe had been appointed head of the Chinese legation.[1] 
At school in Madrid, Nadine Hwang spoke Castilian fluently as well as her native French. 
She practiced Mandarin Chinese with the other families in the legation and took English lessons. 
Emancipation 
The family moved to China, where they moved among the political, intellectual and social elite. 
Nadine Hwang continued her education in an international school run by French nuns. 
She then studied law at the American Hamilton College via distance learning.[1] 
As a young girl from a family of high social status, Hwang had the privilege of meeting personalities of her time such as Mao Zedong, Lin Yutang, and Hu Shi, who were invited to the family home as guests.

As a result of the merger of T-Online International with Deutsche Telekom, Scout24 became a direct subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom from June 2006.[2] 
On September 7, 2015, Scout24 announced its IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 
A total of around 29.5 million shares are to be placed at an offer volume of EUR 899 million. 
After the IPO, Hellman & Friedman will hold 49% and Deutsche Telekom 14% of the shares. 
The remaining share is to be in free float. 
In the Southeast Asian island state of East Timor, a diverse and widespread gang system has developed in recent decades, with unemployed youth, disappointed farmers, former freedom fighters and members of the former pro-Indonesian militias joining together to form sometimes aggressive associations. 
Active and former members of the police (PNTL) and the armed forces (F-FDTL) can also be found here. 
Some of these groups call themselves martial arts clubs, others have quasi-religious features. 
In July 2013, the three largest martial arts groups were banned, followed by two more groups in March 2014. 
Youth with slingshot in Dili 
After 24 years of war, the inhabitants of East Timor still have problems finding their way in peace and resolving conflicts in a peaceful way. 
In addition, traditional Timorese society was also marked by constant fighting between the many small kingdoms, and there were also repeated uprisings against the Portuguese colonial rulers.[1] Some gangs trace their roots back to the Portuguese colonial period, others to the Indonesian occupation, but many seem to have emerged afterwards. 
The influence of the country's history is reflected in different ways in the various groups. 
Some refer to the old traditions of Timor, others are a rallying point for the veterans of the resistance against the Indonesians and glorify the fallen heroes of the people. 
Other groups also include former members of the Wanras who first have to find their own role in the new state.[2] 
Social background 
Destruction in Dili due to the 2006 riots 
Dili is a melting pot of East Timor's different ethnic groups. 
From all over the country, mainly young men come to Dili in search of work. 
Therefore, the proportion of men is significantly higher than the proportion of women. 
Almost 80,000 of the inhabitants were born outside Dili. 
Only 54 % of the inhabitants were born here. 
7 % were born in Baucau, 5 % each in Viqueque and Bobonaro, 4 % in Ermera, the rest in the other districts or abroad.[1] 
Due to the evictions of recent years, unresolved claims to land, houses and properties are the source of constant disputes. 
Cultural diversity adds to the problem when couples are formed in which the man comes from a culture that passes on the inheritance patrilineally and the woman from a matrilineal culture. 
The dispute over inheritance is then pre-programmed. 
Social envy is also a widespread evil, known in Indonesia as kecemburuan. 
Property of those who are economically successful is destroyed in order to "cut them back" to an equal level with the others. 
In addition, there is a lot of civil violence, such as acts of revenge, fights over women and also violence within families. 
Gender-based violence in particular is a widespread problem that national and international organisations are working hard to combat with a campaign against violence against women.[1] 
The reasons for joining one of the gangs vary. 
Gang leaders sometimes gain a reputation similar to that of village chiefs. 
In addition, the gangs offer a certain security from violence by other gangs and political reasons can also play a role. 
Especially for young men, belonging to a group with its own identity is attractive - a major problem for the country, as the share of the population with an age below 15 years is 41.6 %.[2] Timorese society has yet to find its way between tradition and modernity. 
Something similar is known from gangs in Papua New Guinea. 
In addition, large parts of the population have been displaced three times since the end of the 1970s, most recently a tenth of the population in 2006, which destroyed established community structures and also resulted in unresolved land ownership claims for many. 
A violent atmosphere often prevailed in the refugee camps. 
The various existing parties did not succeed in integrating these refugees. 
Instead, their own groups formed here.[3] 
The members of the gangs are mostly young men, but there are women even in the leading positions. 
Most of the time, however, they tend to be hangers-on or serve as welcome spectators who cheer the men on during the fights. 
Some groups even have offshoots abroad, such as in West Timor, Indonesia, or overseas. 
For example, in October 2007, there was a clash between Timorese students in Yogyakarta who belonged to the opposing groups Kera Sakti (KS) and PSHT.[1] 
Different groups were and are in conflict with each other, but also with the different political forces in the country. 
Besides political, economic and territorial reasons, a front can also be identified along the regional division into residents of the East (Loro Sae) and West (Loro Munu) parts of East Timor, even if many gangs deny this because they often see themselves as national, not regional organisations. 
Ultimately, however, it is now difficult to assess what is a fundamental cause and what is merely a trigger for the current rivalry between the groups. 
Thus, personal antipathies also play a role or one is at enmity with the other group simply because they are the "others". 
The conflicts between the gangs escalate again and again in street fights, mainly in the west of the state capital Dili. 
The city is a melting pot where inhabitants from different parts of the country live in close proximity to each other. 
After the peak of violence in 2006, the situation has calmed down, but remains tense. 
As late as 2007, there were regular stone-throwing incidents and clashes, resulting in repeated injuries and deaths. 
Background 
Historical Background 
East Timor 
East Timor has had a violent past. 
Originally, the island of Timor was fragmented into a multitude of small and micro kingdoms ruled by Liurais (petty kings). 
Despite a complex alliance system, conflict between the kingdoms was an integral part of the culture, even if the fighting was highly ritualised.[1] Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the colonial powers Portugal and the Netherlands extended their sphere of power over the entire island. 
Rebellions (especially in the 19th century) were violently put down by the colonial powers. 
During the Second World War, the island was occupied by the Japanese. 
A guerrilla war broke out between the Allies and the Japanese, the so-called Battle of Timor, in which Timorese on both sides fought each other. 
After the proclamation of independence by the leftist Fretilin on 28 November 1974, Indonesia began to occupy the country only a few days later. 
The resulting guerrilla war and other consequences of the occupation killed 183,000 people. 
In 1999, the international community moved Indonesia to hold a referendum in which the inhabitants of East Timor could choose between internal autonomy and complete independence from Indonesia. 
The clear majority voted for independence on 30 August, despite intimidation attempts by pro-Indonesian militias, the so-called Wanra. 
After the referendum, Operation Thunder by the Indonesian army and the Wanra led to a final wave of violence that claimed another 3000 lives. 
The United Nations then sent an international intervention force (INTERFET) to restore peace and order. 
East Timor came under UN administration and finally gained independence in 2002. 
In 2006, violent unrest broke out and an international stabilisation force (ISF) and a UN police mission (UNMIT) were again deployed. 
One element of the unrest was the different gangs. 
Street fights broke out between them. 
PSHT members in Laclo 
In November 2006, fighting broke out between the groups Colimau 2000 and Persaudaraan Setia Hati Terate (PSHT). 
From Ermera municipality, they spread to Dili. 
Seven people died. 
The background is unclear, but is said to lie in a centuries-old conflict between some villages. 
It may also have been about controlling smuggling across the border into Indonesia, especially near the town of Maliana. 
A broader alliance of several groups quickly formed against the PSHT, including Korka (KORK) and 7-7.The reason given was that the PSHT is financed from Indonesia, but it is more likely that the PSHT had tried too aggressively to gain control over various areas and illegal activities there in the period before. 
The fighting between PSHT and 7-7 continued throughout 2007. 
The centres were the eastern Municipalities of Baucau and Viqueque. 
Part of the conflict here was also land disputes between locals and residents who were forcibly resettled here by the Indonesians during the occupation. 
On 15 August 2011, clashes broke out between the PSHT and Korka martial arts groups from Tashilin and Galitaz (Cova Lima municipality), during which several houses were burnt down. 
A policeman was stabbed in the process.[1] At the end of August 2011, four people died in Baricafa (Lautém Municipality) in a clash between two martial arts groups. 
As a result, Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão ordered the closure of the martial arts clubs.[2] After months of clashes between the two groups in Moris Foun (Dili), a new peace agreement was reached between PSHT and 7-7 on 1 December 2011.[3]

Vision Austria (VÖ) is an Austrian minor party that will make its electoral debut in the 2023 Carinthian state election 
Vision Österreich was founded in July 2022 by the Carinthian lawyer Alexander Todor-Kostic. 
He had previously been the Carinthian state spokesman for the MFG Austria, which emerged during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was considered its likely top candidate for the state elections in March 2023. 
However, after an internal party conflict, he was dismissed by the MFG federal executive board in May 2022 because of "party-damaging behavior". relieved of his function.[1] In July 2022, Todor-Kostic announced the founding of Vision Austria, the first goal of the party was to enter the Carinthian state parliament. 
At the time it was founded, regional groups existed in Carinthia, Tyrol and Styria.[2] 
The filing of the party statutes with the Austrian Ministry of the Interior and thus the official founding of the party took place on 21 July 2022. 
On 31 December 2022, the Vision Austria – Provincial Party of Carinthia (VÖK) was also registered as an independent party.[1] According to its statute, the activities of Vision Austria extend to the entire federal territory. 
The federal party is set up as an umbrella organization for the legally independent state organisations. 
These should each act autonomously in their area, but must not contradict “the principles and basic values” of the federal party.[2] 
2023 Carinthian state election 
On 23 January 2023, the party announced that it had collected the declarations of support required to run in the Carinthian state elections. 
The top candidate is state party spokesman Alexander Todor-Kostic.[1] Immediately afterVÖ was founded, he emphasized that Vision Austria was "not an MFG II".[2] The party presented a 19-part election program for the state elections and called for the maintenance of Klagenfurt Airport, improvement of nursing care and the passing on of Kelag's profits to the population. 
In addition to state issues, the program also touched on federal policy issues (processing of the coronavirus measures, maintaining neutrality, price reductions).[3] 
Der offizielle Name lautete 1965 VFZ Vieh- und Fleischzentrale Westfalen eGmbH.[1] 
Seitdem stiegen die Mitgliederzahlen von rund 100 auf über 4.000 Mitglieder an.[1] 
2002 scheiterte die Fusion allerdings endgültig, Konkurrent Bestmeat (heute VION) übernahm Nordfleisch schließlich 2003.[1][2] 
Westfleisch is German company of the meat industry headquartered in Münster. 
Westfleisch is the second-largest meat company in Germany[1] and one of the largest in Europe.[2] 
Im selben Jahr überschritt das Unternehmen erstmals die Umsatzmarke von 2 Milliarden Euro.[1] 
Im Dezember 2012 nahm Westfleisch einen eigenen Zerlege- und Verarbeitungsbetriebs in Rumänien in Betrieb und gründete zudem ein Vertriebsbüro in Korea.[1] Im Jahr 2015 übernahm Westfleisch die insolvente Rindfleischsparte des niedersächsischen Verarbeiters Gausepohl.[2] 
Die Zusammenarbeit mit europäischen Handelspartnern sei mit dieser Identität deutlich einfacher und biete der Genossenschaft neben verbesserten Wettbewerbschancen eine internationale Unternehmenskultur und breitere Finanzierungsmöglichkeiten.[1] 
Am 8. Februar 2016 kam es zu einem Brand am Standort Paderborn, wodurch eine Lagerhalle und Bereiche der Produktion großteils zerstört wurden.[1] Aufgrund des Produktionsausfalls ließ Westfleisch am Schlachthof Gelsenkirchen im Auftrag schlachten. 
Structure 
The holding company Westfleisch SCE mit beschränkter Haftung is organised in a cooperative with around 4,900 members.[1] 
Der Export-Anteil, in Ländern sowohl innerhalb als auch außerhalb der EU, betrug dabei rund 27 %.[1] 
Im Vorjahr waren es lediglich 4.681 Vollzeitkräfte, der Anstieg war insbesondere auf die Übernahme von Werkvertragsarbeiter zurückzuführen.[1] 
Criticism 
Die Bielefelder Staatsanwaltschaft äußerte den Verdacht der Steuerhinterziehung in Millionenhöhe, Betrug sowie Bildung einer kriminellen Vereinigung.[1] Staatsanwalt Falk Schnabel von der Bielefelder Staatsanwaltschaft nannte den Ermittlungsstand „ein Sammelsurium von Indizien“ und betont die Kooperation von Westfleisch: „Es sind freiwillig vom Unternehmen Unterlagen übergeben worden.“ Er weist auch darauf hin, dass nicht der ganze Betrieb, sondern nur Teile von den Ermittlungen betroffen seien.[2] Mit gefälschten Gesundheitsattesten sollen polnische und rumänische Arbeitnehmer von Subunternehmen beschäftigt worden sein. 
Westfleisch was repeatedly criticized. 
Among others, the company was accused of poor working conditions and animal cruelty. 
Die dort genannten Ziele für Qualitätskontrollen, Frischegarantien, Nachhaltigkeit bis zum Tierschutz werden einmal jährlich durch die unabhängige Zertifizierungsgesellschaft SGS Germany GmbH auditiert.[3] 
Nach Informationen der Oldenburgischen Volkszeitung sind rumänische Arbeiter-Kolonnen des verurteilten Chefs der Leiharbeitsfirma weiter im Einsatz.[2][3] 
In Schweinemastbetrieben sind von dem Verein tierretter.de im August 2017 durch investigative Recherche eklatante Verstöße in der Tierhaltung dokumentiert worden.[1] In allen untersuchten Zulieferbetrieben von Westfleisch fänden sich Haltungszustände, die einen Straftatbestand erfüllen würden. 
Publik wurde dies im Oktober 2017 durch Berichte des WDR und der ARD zu der Dokumentation des Tierschutzvereins tierretter.de.[2] 
Zu seinen Themen zählten Umweltschutz, Tierschutz und Tierwohl, Qualitätskontrollen und Frischegarantie, Sozialverantwortung, Mindestlohn und Mitarbeiterbeteiligung.[1] Westfleisch hat Anfang 2010 erstmals eine CO2-Bilanz der Schweinefleischproduktion errechnet. 
Von der Ferkelaufzucht bis in die Fleischtheke wurden damals 3,2 Kilogramm CO2 pro erzeugtem Kilogramm Schweinefleisch emittiert.[2]

Career 
Martina Sester studied biology at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg and at the University of Sussex in Brighton from 1991 to 1994. 
In 1996, she completed her doctorate at the Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology in Freiburg with a thesis on proteins of a subtype of adenoviruses.[1] 
After her doctorate, she moved to Saarland University Hospital (UKS) in Homburg and headed a research laboratory focusing on infection immunology and immune monitoring until 2009. 
In 2004 she habilitated and received the authorisation to teach in the subject of experimental medicine.[1] 
In the following years, she and a colleague developed a new immunoassay for transplantation. 
The procedure is used to test whether a patient's immune system is strong enough to fight an infection with the cytomegalovirus or whether it is necessary to take action against possible complications with medication. 
For this purpose, the individual relationship between viral load and immune defence is determined.[1] The procedure was included in routine diagnostics after organ transplants at the university hospital and formed the basis for further research projects in the field of other bacterial and viral infections and found its way into more than 100 publications.[2] 
In 2009, Martina Sester was appointed Professor of Transplantation and Infection Immunology at the UKS.[1] 
In addition to her academic career, Martina Sester is involved in the committees of her university. 
She was deputy vice dean of the Department of Clinical Medicine and has been deputy dean of research since 2014. She is also the Faculty Equal Opportunities Officer at the Faculty of Medicine and a member of the advisory board of the Excellence Programme for Women Scientists.[1] 
Lake Donggi Cona (also Donggei Cuona or Dongxi Co) is located 4,090 m above sea level at the Tibetan Plateau. It´s surface area is ca. 
229 km². 
Geology and water chemistry 
The lake basin is a tectonic pull-apart structure situated at the highly active Kunlun fault. 
It is characterised by a 92 m deep graben structure in the deeper western part of the lake basin, and a more shallow eastern part which is filled up with fluvial sediments. 
Since ca. 6800 years, the lake is an oligotrophic freshwater lake, with oxygen supply down to the lake bottom and a mean pH of 8.6. 
A higher primary productivity than at present and brackish conditions were inferred for the late glacial to mid Holocene period.[1][2] 
Ecology 
The vegetation in the lake catchment consists mainly of alpine meadows dominated by Kobresia, Artemisia, and Poaceae. 
Dunes on the alluvial plains around the lake are characterised by occurance of Salix sp.

Quast grew up in Müden on the edge of the Lüneburg Heath as the son of a florist. 
He graduated from the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies at the Justus Liebig University Gießen, where he studied under Heiner Goebbels. 
He is a solo artist who collaborates regularly with Maika Knoblich, Les Truces (Charlotte Simon and Toben Piel) and Christina Neuss,[1] among others. 
Film und Medien Stiftung NRW (in German). 
Due to Quast's processual understanding of theater in the tradition of postdramatic theater, his work transcends not only established dramaturgies and temporalities, but also the genres performance and theater. 
For his performances, he learns performing techniques such as ventriloquism, mime and musical singing. 
He includes everyday practices, crafts and cultural techniques such as taxidermy, nail design and funeral floristry in his performances, which are performed on stage or in site-specific formats. 
His works draw on queer aesthetics, pop culture and everyday experiences of chronic conditions. Quast questions canonized theater and the distinction between entertainment and high culture. 
In his latest performances, Quast appears as an alter ego that adapts specific ways of speaking and acting depending on the context. 
For example, he plays the "Influcancer" named Hendrik with a "K" who is a mime coach for social media in the project "Dancer with Cancer“.[1] In the project "Spill Your Guts“, Quast goes on stage as a ventriloquist with his puppet personifying his chronic condition.[2][3][4] 
Quast performs in independent theaters, such as Sophiensäle Berlin, Künstlerhaus Mousonturm in Frankfurt/Main, Gessnerallee Zürich, FFT Düsseldorf, Theater Rampe Stuttgart and Kampnagel in Hamburg. 
He also performs at art institutions such as GAK Bremen, M1 Hohenlockstedt and Fridericianum. 
His works are part of international art festivals such as Impulse, Steirischer Herbst, Festival a/d Werf and Summer Festival Kampnagel. 
As author and director, he adapted three of his theater works as radio plays for WDR Cologne. 
From 2011 to 2015, he worked at the Graduate School of the Berlin University of the Arts in the field of aesthetic research. 
Since 2023, he is an artistic PhD candidate at Stockholm University of the Arts and is doing his PhD on humor and sickness in the performative art in cooperation with Zurich University of the Arts.

Brainfuck (with GRM pronounced as Grime) is a dystopian novel by the German-Swiss author Sibylle Berg, published in April 2019 by Kiepenheuer & Witsch. In 2019 it won the Swiss Book Prize.[1] 
Plot 
Commercial success 
Immediately after its publication, the novel made it onto Der Spiegel's bestseller list, where it was listed among the top ten books ten times and achieved fourth place. 
This makes the book the author's most successful publication to date.[1] 
Contemporary criticism 
The apocalyptic writing style is frequently discussed in reviews of the book. 
Ursula März of Die Zeit finds the ability of this gloomy milieu study to evoke tenderness and empathy in the reader despite its brutality to be a colossal achievement.[1] Carsten Otte in Der Tagesspiegel also attests to the novel's astonishing impact, despite its simple narrative premise and rabid doom-mongering.[2] Dietmar Jacobsen of literaturkritik.de, however, describes the book as "perhaps one or two hundred pages too long".[3] Eva Behrendt in Die Tageszeitung and Marlen Hobrack in Die Welt find that the characters in the book do not develop a personality, but are simply abandoned to their misery.[4][5] For Philipp Theison in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung the book is hard to categorise and against everything that still believes in a blueprint for the future.[6] 
The novel is set in the near future in the English town of Rochdale and describes the lives of four teenage friends. 
They belong to the so-called lower class, and their everyday life is characterised by poverty, unkindness and brutality. 
After all four teenagers lose their original family through various strokes of fate, they move to London, with the aim of taking revenge on people living in London who have had a negative impact on their lives. 
Here they live outside the city and society in abandoned factories, where they come into contact with the local hacker scene. 
They are able to locate and observe the targets of their revenge, but they all either die or lead an unhappy existence without any intervention from the main characters. 
The author also addresses social developments in the course of the novel. 
For example, due to high unemployment, the unconditional basic income is introduced, but at the same time it is linked to a morally normative, technological state surveillance system.

Style 
The style of the novel is partly influenced by rap. 
The word GRM is a disemvoweling of the word grime, referring to the rap style. 
The narrator focuses on one character at a time and then switches to portraying the next person by mentioning their name. 
This person is introduced, especially if he or she is new to the plot, through a kind of profile in the form of catchwords, as in a wanted poster. 
In addition to the four main characters of the novel, people who have a (mostly negative) influence on the protagonists are also described in this way. 
Among others, this includes Thome, who belongs to the upper class. 
Characters 
The following characters play a crucial role in the novel: 
Don has a brother with whom she lives along with her black, single mother in the first part of the book. 
The mother has frequently changing partners (including Don's father in some cases), who are usually aggressive and also beat and harass Don. 
Hannah is the only child of Asian parents. 
Her mother dies after a medical error, leading her father to commit suicide. 
Karen is highly gifted and therefore suffers especially from the viciousness of her two brothers. 
Her black, single mother is completely overwhelmed by the situation. 
All family members (except Karen) die in a house fire. 
Peter is autistic and comes to England from Poland with his mother. 
His mother leaves him alone in Rochdale and moves to London with a rich Russian.

The band was formed in 1984 by bassist/vocalist Paul Arnold, guitarist Shawn Helsel and drummer Dave Stone. 
At War's aggressive, powerful and fast-paced musical style made them the first speed metal band to emerge from their native state of Virginia. 
At War's style was heavily influenced by the early work of bands like Motörhead, Venom and Metallica. 
In the original line-up, all music was written by Helsel, Arnold, and Stone, with all lyrics written by Arnold. 
The band's lyrics and album covers deal with issues such as politics, war, terrorism and morality, which have caused minor controversies. 
At War's music was influential in the underground scene and has been cited as an influence by many bands, and the band's debut album Ordered To Kill has also been described as being on the forefront of the early extreme metal scene. 
The album was recorded in January of 2009 at Pyramid Sound Studio with producer Alex Perialas (e.g. Testament, Overkill, Nuclear Assault). 
Style 
The band plays classic thrash and speed metal, with the songs consistently being at a high speed. 
Borrowings from Motörhead and Whiplash can clearly be heard in the songs.

The Hamburg Organ Landscape describes the existence of organs in the Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg and its historical development. 
The term Organ Landscape alone refers to the national or regional characteristics of the organs as they developed over time. 
The organ landscape of Hamburg borders the organ landscape of Lüneburg in the South, the organ landscape of the region between the Elbe and Weser in the West, and the organ landscape of Schleswig-Holstein in the North, on the North side of the Elbe. 
Admittedly, Hamburg had a leading position in North German organ construction thanks to favorable financial conditions, but it was still bound to the different cultural regions of its vicinity in many different ways and did not take a uniquely special role in organ construction.[1] 
Under the influence of the Scherer Organ-Building Family, and through the work of Gottfried Fritzsche and Arp Schnitger, both of whom worked in Hamburg, North German baroque Organ construction reached a high point and influenced organ building worldwide.[1] Since many of the historic organs were replaced or destroyed by war and catastrophe over the years, many new organ constructions can be found in the organ landscape of Hamburg. [2] More details regarding these organs are found in the List of Organs in Hamburg. 
From the Beginnings until 1540 
Important Organ builders and Their Works 
In Rechnungsbüchern der Jacobi-Kirche ist ab dem Jahr 1508 eine Bezahlung für den (namentlich nicht genannten) Organisten dokumentiert; ab 1517 sind alle Jacobi-Organisten mit Namen bekannt.[2] Aus vorreformatorischer Zeit sind für Hamburg sieben Orgelbauer mit Namen bekannt. 
Einige Orgelbauer waren zugleich Organisten wie Johann van Kollen, der 1467 an Sankt Petri angestellt wurde.[3] Im Jahr 1502 schuf Harmen Stüven ein neues Werk für das Heilig-Geist-Hospital. 
Die Reformation führte in Hamburg zwar nicht wie andernorts zur Zerstörung von Orgeln, aber zu einem Stillstand im Orgelbau bis etwa um 1540.[4]

It aims at supporting the preservation and the development of the Sorbian communities, languages, culture, and traditions. 
Structure and history 
Ćišinski prize 
The foundation has its seat in the house of the Sorbs in Bautzen. Additionally, it has a branch offices in Cottbus and regional offices in Crostwitz, Hoyerswerda and Schleife. 
It provides most of the funding for the Sorbian institutions. 
The foundation was established on October 19, 1991 in the Lutheran church of Lohsa.[1][2] 
The foundation biennial awards the Ćišinski prize named after the Sorbian poet Jakub Bart-Ćišinski.

The funding is provided by the Federal Republic of Germany and the states of Saxony and Brandenburg. 
The foundation grants about 23.9 million € annually to Sorbian institutions like the Sorbian National Ensemble, the Domowina including its language center Witaj, the Domowina publishing house, the Serbski Institut, the German-Sorbian Theater, the Wendian Museum Cottbus and the Sorbian Museum Bautzen.[1] 
The Serbski dom (German: Haus der Sorben, 'House of the Sorbs'), is an administrative building located at the Postplatz 2 in Bautzen, Saxony, German. 
It is the cultural and political center of the Sorbian people. It was built between 1947 and 1956. It is the seat of Domowina and the Foundation for the Sorbian People. 
After World War II 
View along Goschwitz street to Postplatz with the Lessing School (left) and the Post Office (right), 1914 
After World War II, the Sorbs were again allowed to speak their language and practice their culture. 
It was attended by numerous guests, including representatives of Slavic speaking countries.[2] 
The building was funded by donations from the Lusatia and Slavic speaking countries (especially the ČSSR, Poland and Yugoslavia) yielding 1.5 million RM. 
In addition, young people of the surrounding villages worked for free in the brigades of the Sorbian youth organization Serbska młodźina during the Natwarjamy Serbski dom ('We build the house of the Sorbs') campaign. 
The political climate in the Soviet-occupied zone, Maćica Serbska became a part of Domowina. 
During the currency reform in 1948, changing Reichsmark (RM) 10:1 for East German Mark (DM), the Domowina lost most of its funds.[1] The construction was severely impaired by the lack of financial resources. 
Therefore, the government allocated 500.000 DM to the construction of Serbski dom. 
Shortly before it was finished, Domowina transferred the building to become public property. 
The building was inaugurated on July 8, 1956, on occasion of the 2nd Sorbian Peoples Congress. 
Deutsche Post of the GDR stamp, 1966 
Kurt Heine created a long term documentation of the history of the Serbski dom from 1947 to 1959 called Naš serbski dom. 
The 70 minutes film shows the cleanup efforts after the war, the groundbreaking and the use of the finished building.[1] In 2017, the film was digitized.[2] 
In 2012/2013, the interior was renovated and the rooms of the former café became office rooms.[1] 
Description 
The new building was necessary since the original Serbski dom (German: Wendisches Haus) was destroyed in April 1945. 
While bearing the same Sorbian name in order to convey continuity, the German name switched due to the pejorative use of the term Wenden during the Nazi period.[1] 
It is a cultural heritage monument in center of Bautzen. It is a four story sand stone building with triangular gables. 
The facade of the ground level is visible stone, while the upper floors are uniform.[1] The building is situated on the norther side of Postplatz, in between Karl-Marx street to the west and Kurt-Pchalek street to the east. 
The facade on the Kurt-Pchalek street resembles the sand stone sculpture "Jungbrigadierleiter", commemorating the Brigaden movement during the construction phase. 
Tenants 
Domowina and the Foundation for the Sorbian People both use the Serbski dom as their main office. 
Additionally, it accommodates the Sorbian Culture Information and the Sorabia-Film-Studios. 
Until February 2010, the ground level had a café, called »Bjesada«.[1]

Wendisches Haus (1845 - 1945) 
Wendisches Haus (left) on the Lauengraben, 1915 
The idea of creating a house for the Sorbian culture dates back to 1845 based on which the Maćica Serbska, a scientific and cultural association, was founded in 1847. 
Pressured by Jan Arnošt Smoler, the then head of Maćica Serbska, the association began to collect donations for the construction of the Serbski dom (Wendisches Haus) in 1866. 
At his own risk, Smoler acquired a building at Lauengraben, Bautzen, which was to become the center of Maćica Serbska.[1] Since most Sorbs were rather poor, Smoler turned to other Slavic nations, especially Russia in search of donors. 
His last voyage to Russia was in 1883, on year before his death.[2] 
Due to the amount of books stored in its library and the ever-growing collection of ethnological objects, the house proofed to be to small for its purpose. Arnošt Muka initiated the construction of a new Serbski dom on the ground acquired by Smoler. 
Most of the funding came from local Sorbs. 
It became the center of Sorbian cultural life, accommodating the scientific community and its library, the Wendische Museum and the Smoler'sche Druckerei und Buchhandlung (Smoler's publishing and book store). In 1912, the newly created Domowina moved in. 
The Sorbian Bank (Wendische Volksbank, Serbska ludowa banka) was founded in the Serbski dom in 1919. 
Following Hitler's rise to power, the Sorbs were supposed to integrate into the new structures. As the Domowina resisted, it was banned and disbanded. 
Hereafter, all the other Sorbian organizations and media were banned and the public use of Sorbian restricted. The building was confiscated. The café was renamed Schöne Lausitz ('Beautiful Lusatia'), the publishing house was shut down. 
The hall was used as a NSDAP reunion room. The collection was destroyed, sold or brought to the Ortenburg.[1][2] During the last days of the war, the SS lay fire to the building. Furthermore, it was hit by a bomb.[3] 
In October 2018, he saved the life of a research assistant of the AfD parliamentary group in the health committee of the NRW state parliament by means of cardiac massage.[1]

Super Six [Edition: Grimminger 
Gameplay with two Dice 
In this variant, each player in turn rolls both dice at the same time. 
The player now has two options. 
First, the player can choose to simply perform the two actions that correspond to the numbers on the dice (for example, in the case of "5 + 6", put a stick in the hole and a stick in place "5"). 
Secondly, the player can also calculate the sum of the two numbers (for example, 6 in the case of "1 + 5") and make a corresponding move; if the sum of the two numbers exceeds 6, the player may divide the sum of the two numbers into two convenient sums and then perform both actions: for example, if the player rolls "3 + 4", he may place "1" and "6", or "2" and "5". 
In another variant of the game, the player calculates the sum of the eyes of the two dice. 
The sum of the eyes takes values between 2 and 12, the expected value is 7. The player whose turn it is calculates the difference between his sum of eyes and 7 (this is a value between 0 and 5) and bets accordingly. 
If he rolls eye sum 7, he may throw one of his sticks into the hole labeled "6". 
Winning Strategy 
When playing with one die and two players, the strategy that maximizes the chances of winning is known for up to 12 sticks. 
If there are 1 to 3 sticks on the lid and the player has the choice to continue rolling the dice, he/she maximizes his/her chance of winning if he/she continues rolling the dice. 
If there are 4 sticks on the cover, it is advisable to stop, unless both players have exactly 1 stick left in their hand, in which case it is better to continue rolling. 
If there are 5 sticks on the cover, it is always advisable to stop. 
If there are 3 sticks on the cover and 10 or more sticks left in the hands of both players, the chances of winning are almost identical if the dice are rolled or not. 
Not much is known about the history or age of the game. 
However, in 1998, a version of the game by the MESPI publishing house was awarded by "spiel gut" as being of special educational value for children. [1] 
Super Six is a dice game for adults and children for two to six players. 
It is particularly suitable for travel situations or waiting situations. 
Due to its compact form, it is also often used as a promotional gift. 
Parts and Equipment 
The equipment of the game includes: 
1 or 2 dice, 36 or more sticks, and a container, often a square box, a cylindrical box or a cube with a small hole in the center of the lid (labeled "6") and arranged around it 5 slots (sometimes also called pits), labeled with the numbers "1" to "5". 
The game material is made of different materials, including wood, plastic or aluminum. 
Manufacturers include MESPI (Sterzing / Italy), Grimminger (Wäschenbeuren), Logoplay Holzspiele, BestSaller, Philos Spiele or Bartl GmbH. 
Rules of the Game 
Gameplay with one Dice 
Before the game begins, the sticks are distributed evenly among the participating players (2-6). 
Alternatively, one can decide on a pre-determined number of sticks that each player gets. 
The goal of the game is to be the first to get rid of all your sticks. 
In the first round, each player in turn rolls the dice. If the player rolls a "6", the player may put one of their chopsticks in the hole of the container - it falls in and remains there. 
Otherwise, if the slot corresponding to the number of dice rolled is still free, the player may put a stick in it. 
If, on the other hand, a chopstick is already in the slot, the player must pull it out and add it to their own chopstick supply. 
A more risky variant is that the player must remove all the sticks from the cover.[1] From the second round on, each player may roll the dice until the player has to take one or all of the chopsticks. However, the player may also decide to stop before that. 
Routes and Roots is an austrian a-cappella-ensemble, founded in 2018. It's members are Julia Beisl (Sopran), Isabella Greimeister-Pfeil (Alt), Doris Schlögelhofer (Alt), Alexander Pacha (Tenor), Jonathan Meyns (Bass) und Vid Leskovar (Bass).[1] 
The repertoire of Routes and Roots includes, among others, the genres Pop, Funk and Wienerlied. 
The band initially covered pop songs. 
Since 2020 it is singing also several own compositions. 
Routes and Roots was founded 2018 - initially as a project for one year. 
The six founding members knew each other from the choir of the Technischen Universität Wien[1]. 
The band name Routes and Roots was proposed on a rehearsal weekend and is inspired by the song No Roots by Alice Merton. 
In summer 2019, one year after founding, Manual Gaviria left the band and was replaced by Vid Leskovar. 
Discography 
In mathematics, more precisely in operator theory, a sectorial operator is a linear operator on a Banach space, whose spectrum in an open sector in the complex plane and whose resolvent is uniformly bounded from above outside any larger sector. 
Such operators might be unbounded. 
Sectorial operators have applications in the theory of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. 
and for every larger angle ψ ∈ ( ω , π ) {\displaystyle \psi \in (\omega ,\pi )} , it holds that 
sup λ ∈ C ∖ Σ ψ ¯ | λ | ‖ ( λ − A ) − 1 ‖ < ∞ {\displaystyle \sup \limits _{\lambda \in \mathbb {C} \setminus {\overline {\Sigma _{\psi }}}}|\lambda |\|(\lambda -A)^{-1}\|<\infty } . 
The set of sectorial operators with angle ω {\displaystyle \omega } is denoted by Sect ⁡ ( ω ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Sect} (\omega )} . 
Remarks 
If ω ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \omega \neq 0} , then Σ ω {\displaystyle \Sigma _{\omega }} is open and symmetric over the positive real axis with angular aperture 2 ω {\displaystyle 2\omega } .

Sectorial operator 
Let ( X , ‖ ⋅ ‖ ) {\displaystyle (X,\|\cdot \|)} be a Banach space. 
Let A {\displaystyle A} be a (not necessarily bounded) linear operator on X {\displaystyle X} and σ ( A ) {\displaystyle \sigma (A)} its spectrum. 
For the angle 0 < ω ≤ π {\displaystyle 0<\omega \leq \pi } , we define the open sector 
Σ ω := { z ∈ C ∖ { 0 } : | arg ⁡ z | < ω } {\displaystyle \Sigma _{\omega }:=\{z\in \mathbb {C} \setminus \{0\}:|\operatorname {arg} z|<\omega \}} , 
and set Σ 0 := ( 0 , ∞ ) {\displaystyle \Sigma _{0}:=(0,\infty )} if ω = 0 {\displaystyle \omega =0} . 
Now, fix an angle ω ∈ [ 0 , π ) {\displaystyle \omega \in [0,\pi )} . 
The operator A {\displaystyle A} is called sectorial with angle ω {\displaystyle \omega } if[1] 
The Stochastic Analysis on Manifolds (also called stochastic differential geometry) is a branch of stochastics, studying the application of stochastic analysis to smooth manifolds. 
It therefore creates a synthesis of stochastic analysis and differential geometry. 
The natural connection between analysis and stochastics stems from the fundamental relation that the infinitesimal generator of a continuous strong Markov process is a second order elliptic operator. 
The infinitesimal generator of Brownian motion is the Laplace operator and the transition probability density p ( t , x , y ) {\displaystyle p(t,x,y)} of Brownian motion is the minimal heat kernel of heat equation. 
Interpreting the paths of Brownian motion as characteristic curves of the operator, Brownian motion is can be seen as a stochastic counterpart of a flow to a second order partial differential operator. 
Stochastic Differential Equations on Manifolds 
Flow processes 
Flow processes (also called L {\displaystyle L} -diffusions) are the probabilistic counterpart of integral curves (flow lines) of vector fields. 
In contrast a flow process is defined with respect to a second order differential operator, and thus, generalises the notion of deterministic flows being defined with respect to a first order operator. 
Partial Differential Operator in Hörmander form 
Let A ∈ Γ ( T M ) {\displaystyle A\in \Gamma (TM)} be a vector field, understood as a derivation by the C ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(M)} -isomorphism 
for some f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C^{\infty }(M)} . 
For the composition, we set A 2 := A ( A ( f ) ) {\displaystyle A^{2}:=A(A(f))} for some f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C^{\infty }(M)} . 
L = A 0 + ∑ i = 1 r A i 2 {\displaystyle L=A_{0}+\sum \limits _{i=1}^{r}A_{i}^{2}} . 
Stochastic analysis on manifolds investigates stochastic processes on non-linear state spaces or manifolds. Classical theory can be reformulated in a coordinate-free representation. 
In that, it is often complicated (or not possible) to formulate objects with coordinates of R d {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}} . Thus, we require an additional structure in form of a linear connection or Riemannian metric to define martingales and Brownian motion on manifolds. 
Therefore, controlled by the Riemannian metric, Brownian motion will be a local object by definition. However, its stochastic behaviour determines global aspects of the topology and geometry of the manifold. 
Flow process 
Let L {\displaystyle L} be a PDO in Hörmander form on M {\displaystyle M} and x ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} a starting point. 
An adapted and continuous M {\displaystyle M} -valued process X {\displaystyle X} with X 0 = x {\displaystyle X_{0}=x} is called a flow process to L {\displaystyle L} starting in x {\displaystyle x} , if for every test function f ∈ C c ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C_{c}^{\infty }(M)} and t ∈ R + {\displaystyle t\in \mathbb {R} _{+}} the process 
is a martingale, i.e. 
E ( N ( f ) t ∣ F s ) = N ( f ) s , ∀ s ≤ t {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} \left(N(f)_{t}\mid {\mathcal {F}}_{s}\right)=N(f)_{s},\quad \forall s\leq t} . 
Remark 
For a test function f ∈ C c ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C_{c}^{\infty }(M)} , a PDO L {\displaystyle L} in Hörmander form and a flow process X t x {\displaystyle X_{t}^{x}} (starting in x {\displaystyle x} ) also holds the flow equation, but in comparison to the deterministic case only in mean 
d d t E f ( X t x ) = E [ L f ( X t x ) ] {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\mathbb {E} f(X_{t}^{x})=\mathbb {E} \left[Lf(X_{t}^{x})\right]} . 
and we can recover the PDO by taking the time derivative at time 0, i.e. d d t | t = 0 E f ( X t x ) = L f ( x ) {\displaystyle \left.{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\right|_{t=0}\mathbb {E} f(X_{t}^{x})=Lf(x)} . 
Life Time and Explosion Time 
Brownian motion is defined to be the diffusion process generated by Laplace-Beltrami operator 1 2 Δ M {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}\Delta _{M}} with respect to a manifold M {\displaystyle M} and can be constructed as the solution to non-canoncial stochastic differential equation on a Riemannian manifold. 
As there is no Hörmander representation of the operator Δ M {\displaystyle \Delta _{M}} if the manifold is not paral- lelizable, i.e. if the tangent bundle is not trivial, there is no canonical procedure to construct Brownian motion. 
However, this obstacle can be overcome if the manifold is equipped with a connection: We can then introduce the stochastic horizontal lift of a semimartingale and the stochastic development by the so-called Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin construction[1][2]. 
Let ∅ ≠ U ⊂ R n {\displaystyle \emptyset \neq U\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} be open und ξ > 0 {\displaystyle \xi >0} a predictable stopping time. 
We call ξ {\displaystyle \xi } the lifetime of a continuous semimartingale X = ( X t ) 0 ≤ t < ξ {\displaystyle X=(X_{t})_{0\leq t<\xi }} on U {\displaystyle U} if 
there is a sequence of stopping times ( ξ n ) {\displaystyle (\xi _{n})} with ξ n ↗ ξ {\displaystyle \xi _{n}\nearrow \xi } , such that ξ n < ξ {\displaystyle \xi _{n}<\xi } P {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} } -almost surely on { 0 < ξ < ∞ } {\displaystyle \{0<\xi <\infty \}} . the stopped process ( X t ∧ ξ n ) {\displaystyle (X_{t\wedge \xi _{n}})} is a semimartingale. 
A flow process X {\displaystyle X} can have a finite lifetime ξ {\displaystyle \xi } . 
In that case we extend the process path-wise by X t := ∞ {\displaystyle X_{t}:=\infty } for t ≥ ξ {\displaystyle t\geq \xi } . 
Semimartingales on a Manifold 
A process X {\displaystyle X} is a semimartingale on M {\displaystyle M} , if for every f ∈ C 2 ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C^{2}(M)} the random variable f ( X ) {\displaystyle f(X)} is an R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -semimartingale, i.e. the composition of any smooth function f {\displaystyle f} with the process X {\displaystyle X} is a real-valued semimartingale. 
It can be shown, that any M {\displaystyle M} -semimartingale is a solution of a stochastic differential equation on M {\displaystyle M} . 
If the semimartingale is only defined up to a finite lifetime ξ {\displaystyle \xi } , we can always construct a semimartingale with infinite lifetime by a transformation of time. 
A semimartingale has a quadratic variation with respect to a section in the bundle of bilinear forms on T M {\displaystyle TM} . 
Introducing the Stratonovich Integral of a differential form α {\displaystyle \alpha } along the semimartingale X {\displaystyle X} we can study the so called winding behaviour of X {\displaystyle X} , i.e. a generalisation of the winding number. 
Stratonovich Integral of a 1-Form 
Let X {\displaystyle X} be an M {\displaystyle M} -valued semimartingale and α ∈ Γ ( T ∗ M ) {\displaystyle \alpha \in \Gamma (T^{*}M)} be a 1 {\displaystyle 1} -form. We call the integral ∫ X α := ∫ α ( ∘ d X ) {\displaystyle \int _{X}\alpha :=\int \alpha (\circ dX)} Stratonovich integral of α {\displaystyle \alpha } along X {\displaystyle X} . 
For f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C^{\infty }(M)} we define f ( X ) ∘ α ( ∘ d X ) := f ( X ) ∘ d ( ∫ X α ) {\displaystyle f(X)\circ \alpha (\circ dX):=f(X)\circ d(\int _{X}\alpha )} . 
SDEs on a Manifold 
The latter is a generalisation of a horizontalen lifts of smooth curves to horizontal curves in the frame bundle, such that the anti-development and the horizontal lift are connected by a stochastic differential equation. 
Using this, we can consider an SDE on the orthonormal frame bundle of a Riemannian manifold, whose solution is Brownian motion, and projects down to the (base) manifold via stochastic development. 
A visual representation of this construction corresponds to the construction of a spherical Brownian motion by rolling without slipping the manifold along the paths (or footprints) of Brownian motion left in Euclidean space.[1] 
A stochastic differential equation on a manifold M {\displaystyle M} , denoted SDE on M {\displaystyle M} , is defined by the pair ( A , Z ) {\displaystyle (A,Z)} including a bundle homomorphism (i.e. a homomorphism of vector bundles) or the ( r + 1 {\displaystyle r+1} )-tuple ( A 1 , … , A r , Z ) {\displaystyle (A_{1},\dots ,A_{r},Z)} with vector fields A 1 , … , A r {\displaystyle A_{1},\dots ,A_{r}} given. 
Using the Whitney embedding, we can show that there is a unique maximal solution to every SDE on M {\displaystyle M} with initial condition X 0 = x {\displaystyle X_{0}=x} . 
If we have identified the maximal solution, we recover directly a flow process X x {\displaystyle X^{x}} to the operator L {\displaystyle L} . 
Definition: SDEs on a Manifold 
An SDE on M {\displaystyle M} is a pair paar ( A , Z ) {\displaystyle (A,Z)} , where 
The stochastic differential equation ( A , Z ) {\displaystyle (A,Z)} is denoted by 
or 
The latter follows from setting A i := A ( ⋅ ) e i {\displaystyle A_{i}:=A(\cdot )e_{i}} with respect to a basis ( e i ) i = 1 , … , r {\displaystyle (e_{i})_{i=1,\dots ,r}} and R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -valued semimartingales ( Z i ) i = 1 , … , r {\displaystyle (Z^{i})_{i=1,\dots ,r}} with Z = ∑ i = 1 r Z i e i {\displaystyle Z=\sum \limits _{i=1}^{r}Z^{i}e_{i}} . 
The stochastic differential geometry provides insight into classical analytic problems, and offers new approaches to prove results by means of probability. 
Examples are given by applying Brownian motion to the Dirichlet problem at infinity for Cartan-Hadamard manifolds[1] or the probabilistic proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.[2] The stochastic differential geometry also applies in other areas of mathematics, like e.g. mathematical finance. 
For example, we can convert classical arbitrage theory into differential geometric language (also called geometric arbitrage theory).[3] 
As for given vector fields A 1 , … , A r ∈ Γ ( T M ) {\displaystyle A_{1},\dots ,A_{r}\in \Gamma (TM)} there is exactly one bundle homomorphism A {\displaystyle A} such that A i := A ( ⋅ ) e i {\displaystyle A_{i}:=A(\cdot )e_{i}} , our definition of an SDE on M {\displaystyle M} as ( A 1 , … , A r , Z ) {\displaystyle (A_{1},\dots ,A_{r},Z)} is plausible. 
If Z {\displaystyle Z} has only finite lifetime, we can transform the time horizon into the infinite case.[1] 
Solution of an SDE on a Manifold 
Let ( X t ) t < ζ {\displaystyle (X_{t})_{t<\zeta }} be a continuous adapted M {\displaystyle M} -valued process with lifetime ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } on the same probability space such as Z {\displaystyle Z} . 
Then ( X t ) t < ζ {\displaystyle (X_{t})_{t<\zeta }} is called a solution to the SDE 
with initial condition X 0 = x 0 {\displaystyle X_{0}=x_{0}} up to the lifetime ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } , if for every test function f ∈ C c ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C_{c}^{\infty }(M)} the process f ( X ) {\displaystyle f(X)} is an R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -valued semimartingale and for every stopping time τ {\displaystyle \tau } with 0 ≤ τ < ζ {\displaystyle 0\leq \tau <\zeta } , it holds P {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} } -almost surely 
f ( X τ ) = f ( x 0 ) + ∫ 0 τ ( d f ) X s A ( X s ) ∘ d Z s {\displaystyle f(X_{\tau })=f(x_{0})+\int _{0}^{\tau }(df)_{X_{s}}A(X_{s})\circ \mathrm {d} Z_{s}} , 
Following the idea from above, by definition f ( X ) {\displaystyle f(X)} is a semimartingale for every test function f ∈ C c ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C_{c}^{\infty }(M)} , so that X {\displaystyle X} is a semimartingal on M {\displaystyle M} . 
If the lifetime is maximal, i.e. 
Preface 
P {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} } -almost surely, we call this solution the maximal solution. 
The lifetime of a maximal solution X {\displaystyle X} can be extended to the whole R + {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}} and after extending f {\displaystyle f} to the whole of M ^ {\displaystyle {\widehat {M}}} , it holds 
f ( X t ) = f ( X 0 ) + ∫ 0 t ( d f ) X A ( X ) ∘ d Z , t ≥ 0 {\displaystyle f(X_{t})=f(X_{0})+\int _{0}^{t}(df)_{X}A(X)\circ dZ,\quad t\geq 0} . 
Remark 
Let Z = ( t , B ) {\displaystyle Z=(t,B)} with a d {\displaystyle d} -dimensional Brownian motion B = ( B 1 , … , B d ) {\displaystyle B=(B_{1},\dots ,B_{d})} , then we can show that every maximal solution starting in x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} is a flow process to the operator 
L = A 0 + 1 2 ∑ i = 1 d A i 2 {\displaystyle L=A_{0}+{\frac {1}{2}}\sum \limits _{i=1}^{d}A_{i}^{2}} . 
Martingales und Brownian Motion 
Brownian motion on manifolds are stochastic flow processes to the Laplace-Beltrami operator. 
It is possible to construct Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} , however, to follow a canonical ansatz we need some additional structure. 
Let O ( d ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(d)} be the orthogonal group, then we consider the canonical SDE on the orthonormal frame bundle O ( M ) {\displaystyle O(M)} over M {\displaystyle M} , whose solution is Brownian motion. 
The orthonormal frame bundle is the collection of all sets O x ( M ) {\displaystyle O_{x}(M)} of orthonormal frames of the tangent space T x M {\displaystyle T_{x}M} 
For the reader's convenience and if not stated otherwise, let ( Ω , A , ( F t ) t ≥ 0 , P ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {A}},({\mathcal {F}}_{t})_{t\geq 0},\mathbb {P} )} be a filtered probability space and M {\displaystyle M} be a smooth manifold. 
The filtration satisfies the usual conditions, i.e. it is right-continuous and complete. 
or in other words, the O ( d ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(d)} -principal bundle associated to T M {\displaystyle TM} . 
The construction of a Brownian motion X {\displaystyle X} by stochastic development from W {\displaystyle W} on M {\displaystyle M} . 
Let W {\displaystyle W} be an R d {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}} -valued semimartingale. 
The solution U {\displaystyle U} of the SDE 
Conversely we call W {\displaystyle W} the anti-development of U {\displaystyle U} or, respectively, π ( U ) = X {\displaystyle \pi (U)=X} . 
In short, we get the following relations: W ↔ U ↔ X {\displaystyle W\leftrightarrow U\leftrightarrow X} , where 
U {\displaystyle U} is an O ( M ) {\displaystyle O(M)} -valued semimartingale; and X {\displaystyle X} is an M {\displaystyle M} -valued semimartingale. 
For a Riemannian manifold we always use the Levi-Civita connection and the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator Δ M {\displaystyle \Delta _{M}} . The key observation is that there exists a lifted version of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the orthonormal frame bundle. 
The fundamental relation reads, for f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C^{\infty }(M)} , 
for all u ∈ O ( M ) {\displaystyle u\in O(M)} with π u = x {\displaystyle \pi u=x} , and the operator Δ O ( M ) {\displaystyle \Delta _{O(M)}} on O ( M ) {\displaystyle O(M)} is well-defined for so-called horizontal vector fields. The operator Δ O ( M ) {\displaystyle \Delta _{O(M)}} is called Bochner's horizontal Laplace operator. 
Martingales with Linear Connection 
To define martingales, we need a linear connection ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } . 
Using the connection, we can characterise ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } -martingales, if their anti-development is a local martingale. 
It is also possible to define ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } -martingales without using the anti-development. 
We write = m {\displaystyle {\stackrel {m}{=}}} to indicate that equality holds modulo differentials of local martingales. 
Let X {\displaystyle X} be an M {\displaystyle M} -valued semimartingale. 
Then X {\displaystyle X} is a martingal or ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } -martingale, if and only if for every f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C^{\infty }(M)} , it holds that 
Brownian Motion on a Riemannian Manifold 
Let ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} be a Riemannian manifold with Laplace-Beltrami operator Δ M {\displaystyle \Delta _{M}} . 
An adapted M {\displaystyle M} -valued process X {\displaystyle X} with maximal lifetime ξ {\displaystyle \xi } is called a Brownian motion ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} , if for every f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle f\in C^{\infty }(M)} 
is a local R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -martingale with lifetime ξ {\displaystyle \xi } . 
Hence, Brownian motion Bewegung is the diffusion process to 1 2 Δ M {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}\Delta _{M}} . 
Note that this characterisation does not provide a canonical procedure to define Brownian motion.

The Notker-Globe is a combination of a terrestrial globe and a celestial globe, which was constructed in the Abbey of Saint Gall at the beginning of the 11th century. 
Such a description of a combination of terrestrial and celestial globe is extraordinary for the 11th century. 
Indications of similar globes are mostly restricted to antiquity and then again the 15th century and later. 
Even though the spherical shape of the earth was well established in the early medieval period, scientist believed that it was simply impractical to build a globe, as the known world at the time would have only covered a small area of the surface. 
Creation 
The exact year of the creation of the globe remains unkown. However, it is estimated to be around the year 1015, as Notker has left several hints related to the timeframe of the the globe's construction. 
The first hint can be found in Notker's comment on the construction of the globe under the supervision of the abbot Purchart, who was abbot of the Abbey from 1001 until 1022. 
Furthermore, the timeframe can be narrowed down even more by looking at a letter written by Notker to Hugo of Sion in 1017. 
In the letter Notker notes that he has finished his commented translation of Boethius, which contains his description of the globe 
The construction of the globe is not ascribed to any single person. 
Rather, it is noted that the construction was accomplished in the abbey under the superviosion of abbot Purchart. 
The creation was probably influenced by the celestial globes created by Gerbert d'Aurillac at the end of the 10th century. 
However, the Notker-Globe contained a significant change compared to the celestial globes of d'Aurillac. 
Notker's description was the first one of it's kind to reference an adjustable axis for a globe. 
Description 
Notker's description of the globe mainly elaborates on the use of the globe and contains no detailed physical description of it. 
The size of the globe remains unknown. 
In a first description of the globe, it is only referenced as a sphere, which Notker used to demonstrate his remarks on geography and astronomy. 
Notker further elaborates that the globe showed the locations of all the people and countries. 
This indicates the presence of a map of the known world on the globe. This map was probably more than just a schematic map, as Notker hints at the demonstrability of his geographical observations on the globe. 
Although the known world only covered a part of the surface of the globe, this did not mean that the rest of the globe remained empty. 
Notker describes the presence of Antipodes, who live on the opposite side of the earth. 
Furthermore, the terrestrial map was also expanded by the presence of the astrological signs, which were there to facilitate geographical and astronomical observations. 
This was also made possible by the globe's adjustable axis. 
Finally, Notker notes that certain alignments of the axis lead to only half of the astrological signs being visible, which indicates the presence of a horizon ring.

Maćica Serbska (Upper Sorbian (help·info); niedersorbisch Maśica Serbska) is a scientific association of Sorbs. 
It aims at promoting Sorbian studies and disseminating knowledge about the Sorbs and their culture. 
It is the oldest Sorbian association that is still operational. 
Its chair person is Anja Pohontsch since 2020. 
The Maćica organizes conferences on Sorbian history and culture, e.g. its annual main conference in Bautzen, and internationally, it co-organizes conferences on Slavic studies. 
It also organizes speeches and other events in the Sorbian settlement area. 
The association helps maintaining existing and erecting new Sorbian monuments. 
The Maćica Serbska entertains close relations with its sister associations Matice slezská, Matice moravská, Matica slovenská and Matica srpska. 
Members 
As of 2014, it has 117 registered members, most of which live in Lusatia, but also in other regions of Germany, in Russia, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, England, Finland or the Netherlands. Its best known members were: Ludvík Kuba, Czeck painter William Krause, German artist Pětr Młónk, Sorbian poet Mjertyn Moń, Lower Sorbian teacher and linguist Arnošt Muka, Sorbian linguist and ethnologist Jan Arnošt Smoler, Sorbian linguist, writer and editor Bogumił Šwjela, Lutheran pastor and linguist Georg Wuschanski, Catholic bishop and bible translator Handrij Zejler, Luthern pastor and writer

In 1847, the Maćica Serbska was founded in Bautzen by Handrij Zejler, Jan Arnošt Smoler, Korla Jan Smoler, Křesćan Bohuwěr Pful, and others as a Sorbian publishing house. 
By and by, it became the center of Sorbian culture and research in Sorbian studies. 
The association issued its own magazine Časopis Maćicy Serbskeje (ČMS) from 1848 to 1937.[1] 
In 1848, during the German revolutions, the Maćica unsuccessfully petitioned the Saxon Court to emancipate the Sorbian language in education and local administration. 
In the second half of the 19th century, the Maćica played a crucial role in creating a uniform Upper Sorbian written language. 
A Lower Sorbian department, the Maśica Serbska, was founded in Cottbus in 1880 at the istance of Hendrich Jordan and Kito Šwjela. 
In Bautzen, the Maćica built the Serbski dom (inaugurated in 1904), which was financed by means of donations. The Serbski dom served as a Sorbian museum, archive, library and event venue for the Maćica and other Sorbian associations. 
In 1941, the Maśica's assets were seized and the association disbanded. The Serbski dom was destroyed in 1945. 
Immediately following the war, the Maćica resumed its activity. 
On demand of the Soviet administration, it had to give up its independence, becoming a part of Domowina. 
In 1951, the coordination of research in Sorbian studies traditionally done by the Maćica was handed over to the newly founded Serbski institut, a part of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. 
Following the Peaceful Revolution, the Maćica Serbska was reestablished in 1991 and became a member of the Sorbian umbrella organization Domowina in 1992. 
Activities 
Jean-Samuel Raobelina entered the Congregation of Missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette and was ordained a priest on March 21, 1959.[1] 
Pope Paul VI appointed him Bishop of Quilmes on April 27, 1978. 
The Archbishop of Antananarivo, Victor Cardinal Razafimahatratra, SJ, ordained him bishop on July 9 of the same year; Co-consecrators were Jean-Guy Rakodondravahatra MS, Bishop of Ihosy, and Francesco Vòllaro OSST, Bishop of Ambatondrazaka.[1] 
The German-Israeli Society eV (abbreviation DIG; also Hebrew: ʾAgudat-ha-Yedidut-Germaniah-Yisraʾel ) is an organization in Germany in which, according to its guiding principles, “Friends of Israel come together in non-partisan cooperation in order to show solidarity with the State of Israel and its people.”[1] 
The Society emerged from the German-Israeli Study Groups (DIS), which had existed since 1957 at the Freie Universität and the Kirchliche Hochschule in West Berlin and at eight universities in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
Controversies 
Some local branches of the DIG criticized the controversial exhibition “ Nakba – Flight and Expulsion of the Palestinians 1948”, which was shown in around a hundred cities.[1] The organizers of the exhibition accused the DIG and other critics of not seeking discourse but simply wanting to stop the exhibition. 
However, at the opening of the exhibition in Osnabrück, even the local DIG chairman Hans-Gert Pöttering (CDU) spoke a word of welcome.[2] The local DIG chairman Hermann Kuhn told the taz about the exhibition in Brementhat the unilateral assignment of blame made by her "is not conducive to the idea of ​​a peaceful coexistence". 
The organizers of the exhibition, including Detlef Griesche from the German-Palestinian Society, accused their critics of behind-the-scenes attempts to prevent it. 
The Berlin DIG chairman Jochen Feilcke ( CDU ) was unable to assert himself in 2010 with a demand for the resignation of the DIG vice president Dirk Niebel ( FDP ) and then resigned himself. 
During a business trip to Israel, Niebel made a statement that he considered undiplomatic and later retracted when he went privately to the Gaza Strip , which is controlled by the radical Islamic group Hamaswanted to enter the country to visit a sewage treatment plant. 
Israeli authorities prevented the trip, which had not been agreed, on the grounds that Hamas would use such visits for propaganda. 
Niebel refrained from running again and argued that there was time, but the criticism made it easier for him to leave." [1][2] 
In 2020 , Michaela Engelmeier was appointed to the newly created office of Secretary General.[1] The work of the DIG is to be professionalized and expanded through the new office.[2] 
Anat Kamm (alternative spelled Anat Kam, hebräisch ענת קם; born in 1987 in Jerusalem[1]) is an Israeli journalist. 
Born in Jerusalem in 1987, Kamm attended Hebrew University Secondary School. 
She became interested in journalism in her youth, writing for the local newspaper Jerusalem (formerly Yedioth Jerusalem ), as well as for the youth channel of the website Walla!.[1] 
After completing her military service, she began studying history and philosophy at Tel Aviv University in November 2008. 
Most recently she wrote for the internet portal Walla!, owned by Israeli daily Haaretz, on pop culture.[1] 
Trial and sentencing 
In January 2010, Kamm was charged with espionage and violating state security.[1] She was accused of forwarding secret documents to Israeli investigative journalist Uri Blau while serving in the army , who allegedly used them to report on the illegal killing of three Palestinians by Israeli soldiers. 
The incident in question happened in Jenin in June 2007 , and Blau's article appeared in Haaretz in November 2008 . 
Kam is said to have copied a total of around 2000 pages, a good third of which are classified as "Top Secret". 
The Military Censorship Boardhad raised no objection to Blau's text.[2][3] 
Kamm began her sentence on 23 November 2011 in Neve Tirza Women's Prison. 
On December 31, 2012, the Supreme Court reduced the sentence to three and a half years plus one and a half probation.[1] 
The Achaemenid royal inscriptions are the surviving inscriptions in cuneiform from the period of Cyrus II in the 6th century BCE to Artaxerxes III in the 4th century BCE. The kings are frequently mentioned at the beginning of the inscriptions. 
Along with the archaeological sources and the administrative archives of Persepolis, the inscriptions are among the primary sources of the Achaemenid Empire. 
Decipherment 
Oluf Gerhard Tychsen listete 1798 als Erster 24 phonetische oder alphabetische Werte für die Zeichen auf.[1] 
Edward Hincks entdeckte, dass das Altpersische teilweise eine Silbenschrift ist.[1][2] 
Designations 
Der zweite Großbuchstabe bezeichnet den Fundort und der dritte Buchstabe ist ein Index, der von der Wissenschaft zur Unterscheidung mehrerer Inschriften vom gleichen Ort gesetzt wurde.[1] 
Der Begriff geht auf Hans Heinrich Schaeder zurück.[1] Die bekanntesten „nicht-authentischen“ Inschriften sind AmHa und AsHa aus Hamadan.[2] 
Overview 
Die Schalen hingegen werden als authentisch aus der Zeit von Artaxerxes I. eingestuft.[1] 
Richard Nelson Frye, der sich über Sukumar Sen lustig machte, verwechselte wiederum 1977 den Satz von Franz Heinrich Weißbach mit einer Gewichtsinschrift.[2] 
The Achaemenid royal inscriptions differ from the earlier Assyrian and Babylonian inscriptions in terms of their multilingualism, and the rhetoric, style and structure.[1] 
Dabei handelt es sich um die ersten drei Zeilen der Inschrift DPa.[1] 
Mit Ausnahme der Behistun-Inschrift lassen sie auch keine Aussage über den Charakter des jeweiligen Königs zu.[1] 
Mit den Monumenten und Texten schufen die Achämeniden ein dichtes ideologisches Netz, das alle Völker des Reichs in ihrer Vielfalt miteinbezog und die herausragende Rolle der Perser betonte.[1] In einer Inschrift von Persepolis[2] zieht Dareios I. eine Linie von Nordosten nach Südwesten, von Südosten nach Nordwesten mit der Aufzählung der äußersten Gebiete und richtet das Augenmerk auf die Größe seiner Herrschaft. 
Sein Reich ist das Werk von Ahuramazda, der alles erschaffen hat: den Himmel, die Erde, das Glück für den Menschen und den persischen König, der diese Schöpfung sichern soll.[3] Die Harmonie des göttlichen Werks kann nur aufrechterhalten werden, wenn das Land und das Volk sicher sind. 
Das befiehlt der König und betet dafür.[4] Er ist der „König über diese Erde“. 
Selten, wenn überhaupt, wird darauf hingewiesen, dass es noch eine Welt außerhalb des Reichs gibt.[5] 
Die Völker außerhalb des Reichs „werden in ein Nicht-Sein auf ‚dürstende Länder‘ und den ‚bitteren Fluss‘ zurückgeworfen.“[1] 
The inscriptions 
The inscriptions mostly appear in three languages: Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian, and two separate scripts (Babylonian and Elamite being different forms of the same cuneiform). 
When they appear together, the privileged position is usually occupied by the Old Persian inscription: it is at the top position when they are lined up one below the other, and in the middle when they are arranged horizontally.[1]

The trilingual inscriptions illustrate the complexity of the Achaemenid Empire: Old Persian is Indo-European, Babylonian is Semitic, and Elamite has its own roots. 
The individual language versions of the inscriptions are not exact translations of each other. 
Sometimes passages are added in one language version that do not appear in the other two. 
The differences are also expressed in details when they are aimed at a specific people: the Old Persian version may emphasize the rulers, the Elamite version the location, and the Babylonian the subject.[1]

A few Achaemenid inscriptions are written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, for example in stelae found near the Suez Canal. 
Other hieroglyphic objects are found on crockery and vessels made in Egypt but excavated at Persepolis, Susa, and possibly Babylonia. 
The famous statue of Darius I was also made in Egypt but brought to Susa.[1] 
Apart from a few isolated Aramaic characters on Achaemenid objects such as seals, weights and coins, the later official language of Imperial Aramaic is conspicuous by its absence. 
The only royal inscription in Aramaic is a copy of the Behistun inscription found at Elephantine in Upper Egypt.[1] 
In 1958 Richard Hallock compiled statistics on the length of the Elamite language versions of the royal inscriptions. 
The Behistun inscription, at over 3,000 words, dwarfs in length and importance any other inscription totaling less than 2,600 words. 
The other inscriptions are rather short and repetitive. 
With 44 texts, Darius I is at the top of the list, followed by Xerxes I with 13 and Artaxerxes I and Artaxerxes II with 7 texts. 
Cyrus II had just 2 Elamite texts on the inscriptions CMa und CMc.[1] 
The great majority of royal inscriptions have been found in the Achaemenid heartlands (Pasargadae, Persepolis, Naqsh-e Rostam) and in the wider area (Susa, Bisutun, Ganjnāme, Babylon). 
The only inscription outside of Iran is the inscription at Van in eastern Anatolia of Xerxes I.[1] 
Lydia Mischkulnig (* 2. August 1963 in Klagenfurt) is an Austrian Writer living in Vienna. 
The winner of the Bertelsmann-Literaturpreis writes mainly novels, narratives and radio plays. 
Einmal leiser dann wieder mit deutlicher Ironie, dreht und wendet sie die Worte.“[1] (Brigitte Schwens-Harrant, from her laudatio for the Veza-Canetti-Preis 2017) 
Karin Fleischanderl summarises in her laudatio for the Johann-Beer-Literaturpreis: „ ‚So wie Mischkulnig schreibt sonst keine‘, hat der Kritiker Anton Thuswaldner festgestellt. 
Für ihren eigenen, eigenartigen Stil, dem es gelingt, die Wirklichkeit aufzubrechen und das Ambigue und Uneindeutige hervorzuholen, erhält sie heute den Johann-Beer-Preis.“[1] 
Darauf, dass die Illusion am Ende platzt, mag es indes weniger ankommen als eben auf die Art und Weise, wie meisterhaft Mischkulnig in diesem sehr zeitgemäßen Setting die Temperaturen schwanken lässt.“[1], so Roman Gerold im Standard.

A hycean planet (from hydrogen and ocean)[1] zusammensetzt) is a hypothetical type of habitable planet, described as a hot, water covered planet with a hydrogen atmosphere, which could bear life.[2][3] According to researchers, density data imply that both rocky Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes (like K2-18b andd TOI-1231 b)[1][3] can fit this type and it is thus expected that they will be common exoplanets.[2] 
Hycean planets could be "considerably larger than what habitable planets were previously thought to be, with radii reaching 2,6 R⊕ (2,3 R⊕) and masses of 10 M⊕ (5 M⊕)”.[1] Moreover, the habitable zone of such planets could be considerably larger than that of "Earth-like planets". 
Additionally, there could be tidally locked "Dark Hycean" ("habitable only on the permanent nightside") or "Cold Hycean" ("negligible irradiation").[1] Hycean worlds could be soon investigated for biosignatures by terrestrial telescopes and space telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, which was launched at the end of 2021.[1][2] 
He was an influential publicist on Central European identity and international relations. 
In 1994 he received the Imre Nagy memorial plaque.

In 1933, after working for Ernő Goldfinger in Paris and for Norman Bel Geddes in New York City, and after completing a traineeship in the state construction administration, Helmut Hentrich founded his own office in Düsseldorf - a forerunner of today's HPP. 
Two years later, Hentrich joined forces with Hans Heuser to form the architectural partnership Hentrich & Heuser. 
Their practice participated in important competitions in the German Reich. 
In 1944, the practice was commissioned by the task force for the reconstruction of bomb-damaged cities to plan the reconstruction of Krefeld. 
Hentrich & Heuser continued its work as a well-established office seamlessly after World War II, in part thanks to their good relationships with Friedrich Tamms and Hanns Dustmann, who planned the reconstruction of Düsseldorf. These relationships were critisized in the so called Düsseldorfer Architektenstreit, a series of contraversies in the early 50s that arouse around the Nazi backgrounds of the personnel policies in the young Federal Republic.[1] 
After Heuser's death in 1953, Helmut Hentrich continued the joint venture with Hubert Petschnigg. 
In 1969, new partners were taken on and from then on, the office was calles HPP - Hentrich-Petschnigg & Parner. 
HPP began to internationalize in 1968 an designed the offices for the Standard Bank Centre in South Africa, the city's first high-rise building. 
In 2017, HPP Hentrich-Petschnigg & Partner GmbH + Co. KG changed its name to HPP Architekten GmbH.[2]

Gravestone of Eduard Friedrich Ferdinand Beer, Alter Johannisfriedhof Leipzig 
Beer has been interested in languages since childhood. 
From 1817 he attended a high school in his hometown. 
Two years later he began to learn the Hebrew language, but also dealt with the Semitic languages in general. 
From Easter 1824 he began studying oriental studies at the University of Leipzig. 
His teachers were Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenmüller, Gustav Seyffarth and Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer. 
He also became friends with the orientalist Bernhard Dorn, who was a student at the same time. 
Because his father died in 1827, Beer had problems financing his studies, so he worked as a proofreader on the side, despite a serious illness in 1828. 
Beer was a member of the Hebrew Society of Georg Benedikt Winers at the university. 
In 1833 Beer completed his studies. 
Thanks to a scholarship, he was also able to receive his doctorate in philology from the university that year. 
He also habilitated in this year for oriental philology, but his thesis Inscriptiones et papyri veteres semitici, quotquot in Aegypto reperti sunt, editi et inediti, recensiti et ad originem hebraeo-judaicam relati, cum Palaeographia hebraea concinnata could not be published; for Wilhelm Gesenius had shortly before published a work containing most of the material from Beer's work. 
That same year, the philosophical faculty hired him as a private lecturer. 
During this time, Beer wrote for literary magazines, rather irregularly, since he had to prepare his lectures. 
In 1838, after a review of cuneiform inscriptions by other researchers in the Hallesche Literatur-Zeitung, he was finally promoted to associate professor of Semitic paleography. 
He held this office until his death. 
On April 5, 1841, he died in Leipzig at the age of 35 from a hemorrhage, which was the result of a lung disease that Beer had been suffering from since his youth. 
Beer knew Hebrew, English, French, Italian and Sanskrit. 
In addition to his university work, he studied gardening and chess. 
He was the first to deal with the inscriptions of the Nabataeans and founded this branch of Semitic epigraphy. 
In his main work, he interpreted inscriptions from the Sinai Peninsula for the first time. 
Even during his time as a professor, he received no salary apart from a few bonuses, so that he was impoverished throughout his life.

The Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN) is a core research center at Universität Hamburg (UHH).[1] Here, experts from twelve disciplines in the natural and social sciences work hand in hand. 
Focusing on climate, environmental and Earth system research, they collaboratively address overarching questions, with a priority on interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, biosphere and geosphere, and natural and anthropogenic changes in the Earth system. 
At the same time, they analyze interactions between society and the environment.[2] 
The CEN regularly participates in major national and international research agendas, some of which it coordinates. 
CEN researchers regularly publish their work in prominent academic journals.[1] 
Cluster of Excellence 
As part of Germany’s Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and States, to date three Clusters of Excellence at Universität Hamburg’s CEN have been awarded funding by the German Research Foundation (DFG): The Clusters of Excellence for climate research CliSAP 1 and CliSAP 2 (Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction) were funded by the DFG for ten years, starting in 2007.[1] Since 2019, the Cluster of Excellence for climate research “Climate, Climatic Change, and Society” (CLICCS) has been supported by the DFG, with an initial funding period of seven years.[2] 
Structure 
The CEN Director is Grischa Perino. The Members of the Board are Grischa Perino, Managing Director Nora Gönsch, and six professors from various research areas.[1] The CEN was founded in 2011 as a research center for Universität Hamburg’s MIN Faculty. 
Since April 2016, it has been designated "a core research center at Universität Hamburg tasked with duties of particular relevance for research and education". 
The CEN School SICSS (School of Integrated Earth and Climate System Sciences) offers a two-year English-language curriculum leading to a master’s degree (M.Sc.). 
It covers a comprehensive range of topics in climate research – from the natural sciences to the social sciences and economics. 
The Graduate School offers a three-year international Ph.D. program in integrated climate and Earth system sciences.[1] 
Research Facilities 
CEN members enjoy access to a variety of research facilities, many of which are operated by the CEN or its member institutes.[1] 
Control Station German Research Vessels at Universität Hamburg Supercomputers at the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) Integrated Climate Data Center (ICDC) at Universität Hamburg Visualization Laboratory at the CEN Integrated Modeling Activities (IMA) at the CEN Environmental Wind Tunnel Laboratory at the Meteorological Institute Hamburg Weather Mast at the Meteorological Institute Libraries Central IT service provider: CEN-IT Precision Engineering Workshop, jointly operated with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M)

Research Areas 
The experts at the CEN pursue interdisciplinary collaboration and hail from the fields of oceanography, meteorology, marine biology, geophysics, geology, soil science, geography, biogeochemistry, history, and the business and social sciences, not to mention peace research and security research. 
Their research efforts are divided into three main areas: 
Earth System Dynamics Sustainability Strategies and Social Dynamics Emerging Issues 
Earth System Dynamics provides and expands on the natural sciences basis for researching Earth system change and its impacts. 
One major goal is to differentiate between natural variability in various components of the Earth system on the one hand, and anthropogenic influences on the other. 
This research is conducted at the global, regional and local scale. 
The area Sustainability Strategies and Social Dynamics focuses on interactions between human beings and the environment. 
The underlying processes are investigated and sustainable options for shaping society are developed. 
Lastly, the Emerging Issues area comprises three sub-areas: the role of soils in our climate system; sustainable food production systems; and climate and geo-risks, which include natural hazards and the effects of human activities. 
For their research, the experts develop in-house models or use those created by other scientific institutes. 
Conversely, many international teams use models “made in Hamburg” to simulate or supplement their own calculations. 
In addition, they use the models to verify their findings. 
Ernst Boutkan (* 3 January 1996 in Haarlem) is a Dutch politician from the Volt Nederland party. 
He has been a member of the House of Representatives for this party since 16 March 2023. 
Biography 
Boutkan was born in Haarlem in 1996 and grew up in Geertruidenberg in Noord-Brabant. 
He studied at Leiden University from 2014 to 2021, where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Cultural Anthropology and a Master's degree in Public Administration and Economics.[1][2] 
In 2018, he became a member of the Volt party.[1] In the 2021 Dutch parliamentary elections, Boutkan was third on Volt's list of candidates. 
The party won three seats in those elections, but fourth-placed Marieke Koekkoek secured the third seat with preferential votes. 
After the elections, he worked as a policy officer for the party's lower house faction. 
Personal life

Climate, Climatic Change, and Society (CLICCS) is a Cluster of Excellence at Universität Hamburg (UHH) in which research is conducted together with major partner institutions.[1] Since January 2019, the Cluster has received funding from Germany’s Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and States, and from the German Research Foundation (DFG).[2][3] CLICCS is a central research project at Universität Hamburg’s Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN), which also coordinates it.[4] 
Research Area B investigates the dynamics of social systems which are connected to the climate, building on Research Area A. It explores social options and obstacles and provides insights into sustainable adaptation scenarios. 
Further, it addresses the social preconditions for lasting decarbonization. 
Research Area C focuses on dynamics between human beings and their environment at the regional scale – where climate change can be seen and felt by individuals, and where local actors can achieve sustainable adaptation. 
Drawing on the outcomes of CLICCS research, new adaptation scenarios are developed and assessed. 
The High-Performance Computing and Data-Intensive Science (HPC) area develops its own software for climate models, together with solutions for processing tremendous amounts of data.[1] 
Structure 
Launched in 2007 and funded by the DFG for ten years, CliSAP, too, was founded by Universität Hamburg and coordinated by the CEN.[4]

The overarching research question is: Which climate futures are possible, and which are plausible? 
The Cluster’s goal is to understand climate change, including natural climate change, extreme events, and unexpected effects.[1] The project encompasses a broad range of topics, from basic research, to climate-system dynamics and social dynamics, to transdisciplinary investigations of human/environment interactions. 
The Cluster of Excellence regularly publishes its findings on overarching research questions in the Hamburg Climate Futures Outlook. 
Research Areas 
CLICCS pursues research in three closely interlinked areas:[1] 
A – Sensitivity and Variability in the Climate System 
B – Climate-Related Dynamics of Social Systems 
C – Sustainable Adaption Scenarios 
Research Area A provides the natural sciences basis for understanding the dynamics of the climate system. 
In this regard, spatial and temporal variation, climate extremes, and current and future climate change are particularly relevant.
