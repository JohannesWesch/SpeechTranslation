for me, it's ocean acidification. 
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently. 
So I will spend a little time at the end. 
I was in Copenhagen in December like a number of you in this room. 
And I think we all found it, simultaneously, an eye-opening and a very frustrating experience. 
It really wasn't on the radar screen. 
You know, they were marginalized in the negotiation room. 
One of the problems is coming up with the right target. 
It's not clear what the target should be. 
And how can you figure out how to fix something if you don't have a clear target? 
Now, you've heard about "two degrees": that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees. 
But there's not a lot of science behind that number. 
We've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Should it be 450? Should it be 400? 
There's not a lot of science behind that one either. 
Most of the science that is behind these numbers, these potential targets, is based on studies on land. 
You know, from an oceanic perspective, 450 is way too high. 
Now there's compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350. 
We are, right now, at 390 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere. 
Now, why is this so complicated? 
Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better? 
Well, the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system. 
There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change. 
There's air-sea interactions. 
Here in Galapagos, we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina. 
But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino. 
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere. 
That changes our climate. 
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet. 
So anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet. 
And we know the solar output's not constant through time. 
So those are all natural causes of climate change. 
And then we have the human-induced causes of climate change as well. 
We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land, the reflectivity. 
So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question. 
Is CO2 produced by man's activities causing the planet to warm up? 
But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things. 
You know, thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man-made causes and the natural causes. 
And we've got it worked out, and we can say, "Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now." 
Now, we have many ways to study natural variability. 
I'll show you a few examples of this now. 
This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic. 
It's a scientific drilling vessel. 
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change, right. 
And so that's what we've done with this ship. 
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle. 
It looks downright tropical there. 
One day where we had calm seas and sun, which was the reason I could get off the ship. 
Most of the time it looked like this. 
We had a waves up to 50 ft. 
and winds averaging about 40 knots for most of the voyage and up to 70 or 80 knots. 
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish. 
It's the ANDRILL project. 
And we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet. 
This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm, drilling at temperatures of minus 40. 
And we drilled in the Ross Sea. 
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there. 
So, this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica. 
Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as 2,000 meters deep. 
So that ice sheet is partly floating, and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat. 
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about. 
When that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters. 
Here's the cartoon on the left there. 
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor. 
So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled. 
It took about 10 years to put this project together. 
And here's what we found. 
Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project, and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses. 
But it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description. 
You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up. 
We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this -- there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand. 
That's the kind of material in the deep sea. 
It can only get there if it's carried out by ice. 
So we know there's an ice shelf overhead. 
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this. 
This is absolutely beautiful stuff. 
This sediment is 100 percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants. 
And these plants need sunlight, so we know when we find that sediment there's no ice overhead. 
And we saw about 35 alternations between open water and ice-covered water, between gravels and these plant sediments. 
So what that means is, what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf, melted back and formed anew about 35 times. 
And this is in the past four million years. 
This was completely unexpected. 
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic. 
In fact, the lore for many years has been, "The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago, and it's been there ever since." 
What caused it? 
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted. 
And you know what? 
We've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount. 
So many of us are convinced now that West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt. 
We do expect to see a sea-level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century. 
And it could be larger than that. 
This is a serious consequence for nations like Kiribati, you know, where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level. 
Okay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos. 
This is a bleached coral, coral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino. 
This is from Champion Island. 
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony. 
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens. 
When these things die, immediately, organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface. 
And so, when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event, it leaves this indelible record. 
You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this. 
And just so you know, 1982-'83, that El Nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. 
Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98. 
And what we found after drilling back in time two to 400 years was that these were unique events. 
We saw no other mass mortality events. 
So these events in our recent past really are unique. 
Either case, it's bad news for the corals of the Galapagos Islands. 
Here's how we sample the corals. 
This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster. 
This coral is eight meters tall, right. 
And it been growing for about 600 years. 
Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral. 
So we have a diamond drill. 
We're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top. 
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone. 
And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it. 
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right. 
So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific. 
We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well. 
I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands. 
And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay. 
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet. 
If you go on the ground there, it looks like this, and this is the grandaddy coral. 
It's 11 meters in diameter, and we know that it started growing in the year 1584. 
Imagine that. 
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters, until 1954, when the earthquake happened. 
Now the reason we know it's 1584 is that these corals have growth bands. 
When you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them, you see these light and dark bands. 
Each one of those is a year. 
We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year. 
And we just count on down to the bottom. 
Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry. 
We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral, and there's a whole bunch of things we can do. 
But in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen. 
Their ratio tells us the water temperature. 
Then after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio, and now you can see, those curves match perfectly. 
In this case, at these islands, you know, corals are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water. 
And of course, our thermometers only take us back 50 years or so here. 
The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years. 
So, what we do: we've merged a lot of different data sets. 
It's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this. 
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years, and we put them together. 
Here's a synthetic diagram. 
There's a whole family of curves here. 
But what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. 
And there's five or six different compilations there, But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals. 
We do similar things with ice cores. 
We work with tree rings. 
And that's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century, right? 
And I chose this one because it's complicated and messy looking, right. 
This is as messy as it gets. 
You can see there's some signals there. 
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others. 
Some of them show greater variability. 
But they all tell us what the natural variability is. 
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere; some are from the entire globe. 
But here's what we can say: what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down. 
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so. 
And there is natural variability caused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos. 
A century-scale, decadal-scale variability, and we know the magnitude; it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade. 
But then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black. 
And there's the temperature up there in 2009. 
You know, that's the strength of our argument, that we are doing something that's truly different. 
So I'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification. 
You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere, from fossil fuels, from cement production. 
Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea, right? 
And as it does so, it makes the ocean more acidic. 
So, you cannot argue with that. 
That is what's happening right now, and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue. 
It has many consequences. 
There's consequences for carbonate organisms. 
There are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate -- plants and animals both. 
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate. 
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid. 
And on coral reefs, where some of the main framework organisms disappear, we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity. 
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. 
There's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean. 
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean. 
So, all of these things -- greater metabolic demands, reduced reproductive success, changes in respiration and metabolism. 
You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience. 
So we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere, going back millions of years. 
We used to do it just with ice cores, but in this case, we're going back 20 million years. 
And we take samples of the sediment, and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean, and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere. 
You have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when CO2 levels were double what they are today. 
Now, what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean, with CO2 levels lower than they are today. 
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now. 
And I think that may very well be true, so I'll close with this. 
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely, but for the sake of the oceans, we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions as soon as possible. 
Thank you very much. 
I mean, it's quite brutal. 
And I'm also a little nervous about this. 
There are nine billion humans coming our way. 
Now, the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet. 
It's a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into. 
It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future, and perhaps the world's future overall. 
So, let's explore. 
The story starts with just a single person, a child, behaving a little strangely. 
This kid is known online as Lil Demon. 
He's doing tricks here, dance tricks, that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before. 
How did he learn them? 
And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken? 
Here's a clue. 
This is what he said at TED in February. 
It felt like a revolution. 
And at TED here in February, their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. 
So, this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar. 
It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two. 
So, in both of these cases, you've got these cycles of improvement, apparently driven by people watching web video. 
What is going on here? 
Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call "crowd-accelerated innovation." 
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. 
You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel. 
You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn. 
And the first thing you need is ... a crowd, a group of people who share a common interest. 
The bigger the crowd, the more potential innovators there are. 
That's important, but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles. 
They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges. 
The second thing you need is light. 
And third, you need desire. 
You know, innovation's hard work. 
It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice. 
Absent desire, not going to happen. 
Now, here's an example -- pre-Internet -- of this machine in action. 
And the desire part comes, I guess, from social status, right? 
Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date. 
There's probably going to be some innovation happening here. 
But on the web, all three dials are ratcheted right up. 
The dance community is now global. 
There's millions connected. 
That's a lot of light. 
But the desire element is really dialed way up. 
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you. 
So, this possibility of a new type of global recognition, I think, is driving huge amounts of effort. 
Also, the system is self-fueling. 
Invite the crowd, let in the light, dial up the desire. 
And, very happily, there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool. 
The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. 
But you can publish your stuff online. 
And if you can get that wheel to turn, look out. 
So, at TED, we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness. 
In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness," because it works for us each time. 
By giving away our TEDx brand, we suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas. 
And these organizers, they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other. 
We are learning from them. 
We're getting great talks back from them. 
The wheel is turning. 
Okay, step back a minute. 
I mean, it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups. 
Even he said that, and he would know. 
We're a social species. 
We spark off each other. 
It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation. 
For the past 15 years, powerful communities have been connecting online, sparking off each other. 
If you take programmers, you know, the whole open-source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation. 
But in the last 10 years, bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold. 
Suddenly, here we are. 
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day. 
Cisco actually estimates that, within four years, more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video. 
If it's all puppies, porn and piracy, we're doomed. 
I don't think it will be. 
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason. 
It packs a huge amount of data, and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it. 
Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber. 
He's a unicyclist. 
But looking at video clips posted by strangers, a world of possibility opens up for him. 
Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate. 
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online, inspire each other to greatness. 
And I have to tell you, as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines, I find this strangely beautiful. 
I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. 
But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea, how about this. 
Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video. 
There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper. 
Here's one such frustrated scientist, Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove. 
He told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this. 
But look at this video. 
I mean, look: if you can show instead of just describing, that problem goes away. 
Why do people like watching TEDTalks? 
All those ideas are already out there in print. 
It's actually faster to read than to view. 
Why would someone bother? 
Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling. 
But even leaving the screen out of it, there's still a lot more being transferred than just words. 
And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic. 
Incredibly, all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. 
Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions. 
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution. 
That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is. 
Someone speaks, there's resonance in all these receiving brains, the whole group acts together. 
I mean, this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. 
It's probably driven our culture for millennia. 
500 years ago, it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. 
It's right here. 
Print scaled. 
But now, in the blink of an eye, the game has changed again. 
So, that primal medium, which your brain is exquisitely wired for ... 
that just went global. 
Now, this is big. 
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. 
They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest. 
Now, TED is just a small part of this. 
I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula. 
Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. 
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and, crucially, to respond, completing the cycle. 
And so, as we've thought about this, you know, it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be. 
TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many. 
Our future is many-to-many. 
Because, if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool, this wheel turns. 
Now, is it possible to imagine a similar process to this, happening to global education overall? 
I mean, does it have to be this painful, top-down process? 
Why not a self-fueling cycle in which we all can participate? 
It's the participation age, right? 
Schools can't be silos. 
We can't stop learning at age 21. 
What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ... 
what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors, instead of net plunderers? 
That changes everything, right? 
I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had. 
But the good news is they are out there. 
Who's the teacher? 
You're the teacher. 
Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up. 
It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now. 
I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. 
I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera. 
There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. 
There's a self-help group. 
They turned a trash place into a garden. 
The same spot, it was a crime spot where people were being robbed. 
They used the same trash to form green manure. 
The same trash site is feeding more than 30 families. 
We have our own film school. 
They are using Flip cameras to record, edit, and reporting to their own channel, Kibera TV. 
Because of a scarcity of land, we are using the sacks to grow vegetables, and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living. 
Change happens when we see things in a different way. 
Today, I see Kibera in a different way. 
My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is: Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. 
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy. 
Right now, Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us, in Nairobi, right now. 
Guys, we've learned from you today. 
Thank you. 
And thank you. 
Let's start with day and night. 
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness, light and then darkness. 
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light. 
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell. 
It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot. 
So, we have this ability as well. 
And in humans, we call it the "body clock." 
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing. 
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside. 
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. 
It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior. 
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal. 
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on; you enjoy your family life inside. 
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active. 
So, what would our natural rhythm look like? 
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense? 
Well, it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night. 
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m. 
until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise. 
And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed. 
And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees. 
So, cut to the modern day. 
We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work. 
And you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but I believe we should understand the costs. 
Thank you. 
And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance. 
And you get a network that looks like this. 
Every dot is a person. 
Every line between them is a relationship between two people -- different kinds of relationships. 
And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity, in which we're all embedded. 
So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics. 
And if everything goes smoothly, one to two weeks from now you'll know where the epidemic was today. 
A kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism I'm going to show you now. 
So, as all of you probably know, the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion-of-innovation, or the adoption curve. 
So here on the Y-axis, we have the percent of the people affected, and on the X-axis, we have time. 
And at the very beginning, not too many people are affected, and you get this classic sigmoidal, or S-shaped, curve. 
And eventually, you saturate the population. 
And this holds for germs, ideas, product adoption, behaviors, and the like. 
But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random. 
They actually diffuse through networks. 
Because, as I said, we live our lives in networks, and these networks have a particular kind of a structure. 
Now if you look at a network like this -- this is 105 people. 
And the lines represent -- the dots are the people, and the lines represent friendship relationships. 
You might see that people occupy different locations within the network. 
And there are different kinds of relationships between the people. 
You could have friendship relationships, sibling relationships, spousal relationships, co-worker relationships, neighbor relationships and the like. 
And different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties. 
For instance, sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties. 
Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. 
Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers, or by their neighbors. 
But not all positions in the network are the same. 
So if you look at this, you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections. 
Some people have one connection, some have two, some have six, some have 10 connections. 
And this is called the "degree" of a node, or the number of connections that a node has. 
But in addition, there's something else. 
So, if you look at nodes A and B, they both have six connections. 
B is located on the edge of the network. 
Now, who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network? 
A, in fact, is more central, and this can be formalized mathematically. 
And this would be much better than monitoring six randomly chosen people, without reference to the structure of the population. 
And in fact, if you could do that, what you would see is something like this. 
On the left-hand panel, again, we have the S-shaped curve of adoption. 
On the Y-axis is the cumulative instances of contagion, and on the X-axis is the time. 
And on the right-hand side, we show the same data, but here with daily incidence. 
But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals. 
The problem, however, is that mapping human social networks is not always possible. 
It can be expensive, not feasible, unethical, or, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing. 
So, how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network? 
Your friends have more friends than you do, and this is known as the friendship paradox. 
And this, in essence, is what's known as the friendship paradox. 
The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree, and are more central than the random people themselves. 
And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network. 
And that happens at every peripheral node. 
So, we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks. 
And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services. 
And also, we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week. 
Exactly what we predicted happened. 
So the random group is in the red line. 
The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left, over here. 
And the difference in the two is 16 days. 
By monitoring the friends group, we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population. 
Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged, as shown on the left. 
And that, as indicated by the white line, occurred 46 days before the peak of the epidemic. 
I should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors. 
Now in our case, although it wasn't necessary, we could also actually map the network of the students. 
So, this is a map of 714 students and their friendship ties. 
And in a minute now, I'm going to put this map into motion. 
We're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days. 
The red dots are going to be cases of the flu, and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu. 
And the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu. 
So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu. 
You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle. 
Here we are on October the 19th. 
The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November. 
Now, as I've been suggesting, this method is not restricted to germs, but actually to anything that spreads in populations. 
Information spreads in populations, norms can spread in populations, behaviors can spread in populations. 
The key thing is that for it to work, there has to be interpersonal influence. 
It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly. 
So, for example, most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity. 
If we immunize 960 of them, it's as if we had immunized a hundred [percent] of them. 
Because even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected, there's no one for them to infect. 
They are surrounded by immunized people. 
So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent. 
Would you get any population-level immunity? 
And the answer is no. 
And similar ideas can be used, for instance, to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world. 
Or, frankly, for advertising with all kinds of products. 
If we could understand how to target, it could affect the efficiency of what we're trying to achieve. 
And in fact, we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this]. 
This is a map of eight million phone users in a European country. 
Every dot is a person, and every line represents a volume of calls between the people. 
Without actually having to query them at all, we can get this kind of a structural insight. 
And in fact, we are in the era of what I would call "massive-passive" data collection efforts. 
And all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before. 
So, for example, we could use truckers' purchases of fuel. 
So the truckers are just going about their business, and they're buying fuel. 
And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel, and we know that a recession is about to end. 
Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors, passively, and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within [networks of] doctors. 
Or again, we can monitor purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations. 
And there are three ways, I think, that these massive-passive data can be used. 
Just text us your temperature." 
And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature, but from centrally located individuals. 
And be able, on a large scale, to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people. 
And actually, we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well-being. 
Thank you. 
Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French? 
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- "vielle à roue." 
And in Spanish, "zanfona." 
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay? 
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle. 
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy. 
It has three different kinds of strings. 
The first string is the drone string, which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe. 
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. 
And the third string is pretty innovative. 
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. 
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog. 
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes a sound like a barking dog. 
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later. 
So, one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy. 
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it]. 
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe. 
And it's very difficult to tune. 
So without further ado, would you like to hear it? 
There I go. 
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. 
Hello. I would like to start my talk with actually two questions, and the first one is: How many people here actually eat pig meat? 
Please raise your hand -- oh, that's a lot. 
And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat? 
In the last year? 
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs. 
A lot goes to the U.K., Germany. 
And I spent about three years researching. 
And in these years, I met all kinds people like, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical. 
But I also met aluminum mold makers, ammunition producers and all kinds of people. 
And it consists of seven chapters -- the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs, blood, fat and miscellaneous. 
You probably start the day with a shower. 
So, in soap, fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent, but also for giving it a pearl-like effect. 
Then, so, before breakfast, you've already met the pig so many times. 
In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products, when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out. 
So what they do is they put gelatin back in, in order to retain the texture. 
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic. 
In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there. 
It's used in paint for the texture, but also for the glossiness. 
In sandpaper, bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper. 
And then in paintbrushes, hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature. 
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one, because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts." 
And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket. 
And what it is -- it's actually steak. 
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops. 
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer. 
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. 
And according to them, this creates an artificial lung in the filter. 
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings, so the collagen is as well. 
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found. 
This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States. 
So I sent this company an email saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research. 
And can you send me a bullet?" 
But they answered and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story. 
Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?" 
I thought that was really weird, as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone. 
It's actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time. 
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery. 
It's really a sort of magical moment. 
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic. 
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin, and you can borrow it." 
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. 
In total, I found 185 products. 
Thank you very much. 
Fifty-two minutes ago, I took this picture about 10 blocks from here. 
This is the Grand Café here in Oxford. 
I took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England, in 1650. 
That's its great claim to fame. 
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. 
That was the healthy choice, because the water wasn't safe to drink. 
And so, effectively, until the rise of the coffeehouse, you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day. 
You would have better ideas. 
You would be sharper and more alert. 
But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space. 
It was a space where people would get together, from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise, and share. 
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex. 
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense; ideas would get together there. 
And an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story. 
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation, unusual levels of creativity? 
What's the kind of environmental -- what is the space of creativity? 
And what I've been looking for is shared patterns, signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. 
We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration. 
All of these concepts, as rhetorically florid as they are, share this basic assumption, which is that an idea is a single thing. 
It's something that happens often in a wonderful, illuminating moment. 
I mean, this is what is happening inside your brain. 
An idea -- a new idea -- is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain. 
It's a new configuration that has never formed before. 
And it turns out that, in fact, the network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of a human brain. 
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero has an organization called Design That Matters. 
They decided to tackle this really pressing problem of the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world. 
So the technology is there. 
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds. 
And what they noticed was, they don't have a lot of DVRs, they don't have a lot of microwaves, but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road. 
There's a Toyota 4Runner on the street in all these places. 
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working. 
So they started to think, "Could we build a neonatal incubator that's built entirely out of automobile parts?" 
And this is what they came up with. 
It's called the NeoNurture device. 
From the outside, it looks like a normal little thing you'd find in a modern Western hospital. 
In the inside, it's all car parts. 
And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota and the ability to fix a headlight, and you can repair this thing. 
We like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know, are like that $40,000, brand-new incubator, state-of-the-art technology. 
That's really where innovation happens. 
And that means we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right? 
I mean, this is one vision of it. 
Another is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge. 
This is a statue from Oxford. 
In fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this. 
So if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative, we have to build spaces that, strangely enough, look a bit more like this. 
This is what your office should look like, it's part of my message here. 
And he recorded all these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas happened. 
The other problem that people have is, they like to condense their stories of innovation down to shorter time frames. 
So they want to tell the story of the eureka moment. 
But, in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record, it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods. 
I call this the "slow hunch." 
They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem, but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them. 
Darwin himself, in his autobiography, tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic eureka moment. 
He's in his study, it's October of 1838, and he's reading Malthus, actually, on population. 
That's in his autobiography. 
Darwin kept these copious notebooks, where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch. 
And that is, actually, how great ideas often happen -- they fade into view over long periods of time. 
Now the challenge for all of us is: How do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this long half-life? 
It's hard to go to your boss and say, "I have an excellent idea for our organization. 
It will be useful in 2020." 
Now a couple of companies like Google have innovation time off, 20 percent time. 
In a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization. 
But that's a key thing. 
And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens. 
And I'll leave you with this story, which I think captures a lot of these values. 
It's just a wonderful tale of innovation, and how it happens in unlikely ways. 
It's October of 1957, and Sputnik has just launched. 
And we're in Laurel, Maryland, at the Applied Physics Lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. 
It's Monday morning, and the news has just broken about this satellite that's now orbiting the planet. 
And, of course, this is nerd heaven, right? 
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach. 
They start talking, and one of them says, "Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing? 
That's an interesting idea." 
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception, and he's got a little antenna set up with an amplifier in his office. 
So Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office, and they start noodling around -- "hacking," as we might call it now. 
So these guys are sitting there, listening to this signal, and people start coming into the office and saying, "That's pretty cool. Can I hear?" 
And before long, they think, "Jeez, this is kind of historic. 
We may be the first people in the United States listening to this. 
We should record it." 
So they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder and start recording these little bleep, bleeps. 
And they start writing down the date stamp, time stamps for each little bleep that they record. 
And then they start thinking, "Well, gosh, we're noticing small little frequency variations here. 
And they played around with it a little bit more and talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other specialties. 
That's pretty cool." 
Could you go the other way? 
Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground if you knew the location of the satellite?" 
And they thought about it and they said, "Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here." 
So they went back and thought about it and came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier." 
Could you work on that problem?" 
Chance favors the connected mind. 
Thank you very much. 
I want you to take a trip with me. 
And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture. 
And you go into the town, and you inquire, "What's going on here?" 
and people are initially reluctant to tell you. 
And then someone says, "These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community." 
HIV isn't like other medical conditions; it's stigmatizing. 
People are reluctant to talk about it -- there's a fear associated with it. 
And I'm going to talk about HIV today, about the deaths, about the stigma. 
It's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story. 
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV. 
And as you can see, Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection. 
There are 33 million people living with HIV in the world today. 
Of these, two-thirds, 22 million are living in sub-Saharan Africa. 
We talk about things in relative terms. 
And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV-positive mothers. 
The United States -- a large country -- each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV who give birth to a child. 
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country -- 8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant. 
So we talk about PMTCT, and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission. 
I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV-positive, she's going to infect her child. 
The reality is really, very different. 
So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in. 
It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery. 
It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex. 
It's an entire package of services, and it works. 
So in the United States, since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s, there's been an 80-percent decline in the number of HIV-infected children. 
What does that mean? 
It means 1,100 children infected each day -- 1,100 children each day, infected with HIV. 
And where do they come from? 
Well, less than one comes from the United States. 
One, on average, comes from Europe. 
100 come from Asia and the Pacific. 
And each day, a thousand babies -- a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa. 
So again, I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa. 
And let's look at another map. 
And here, again, we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. 
That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa. 
And it's the same with nurses. 
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa has 24 percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. 
That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients. 
A nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day, which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient. 
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean? 
And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes. 
It's not possible -- it doesn't work. 
And so we need to find better ways of providing care. 
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa -- mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies. 
These women are here for care, but we know that just doing a test, just giving someone a drug, it's not enough. 
Meds don't equal medical care. 
Doctors and nurses, frankly, don't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand. 
You should always use a condom," and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered -- what's going to happen? 
So, I want to tell you a story -- I want to take you on a little trip. 
Imagine yourself, if you can, you're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic. 
You go in for a test and you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted. 
And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated. 
All you're hearing is, "I'm going to die, and my baby is going to die." 
And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go. 
And this -- this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today. 
But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news. 
And I want to change the story a little bit. 
Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test, takes her to a room. 
The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies, and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening. 
They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches. 
And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says, "Welcome to mothers2mothers. 
Have a seat. You're safe here. 
We're all HIV-positive. 
You're going to be okay. You're going to live. 
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative." 
We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource. 
Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home. 
So often the men are gone. 
They're working, or they're not part of the household. 
Our organization, mothers2mothers, enlists women with HIV as care providers. 
Consider: if you needed surgery, you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right? 
Patients are experts on their own experience, and they can share that experience with others. 
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. 
So the mothers who work for us, they come from the communities in which they work. 
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses. 
They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum-based education, training. 
Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained. 
But so often, they only get trained once, so they're not aware of new medicines, new guidelines as they come out. 
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. 
And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts. 
Our organization has three goals. 
The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission. 
The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive, keep the children alive -- no more orphans. 
So how do we do it? 
We go beyond that; we try to bring in the husbands, the partners. 
In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men. 
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care. 
And so the father and the mother, together, go through the counseling and the testing. 
The father and the mother, together, they get the results. 
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. 
Disclosure is so central to prevention. 
How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure? 
We also work in groups. 
And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves, how to disclose how to take medicines. 
And then there's the community outreach, engaging women in their communities. 
If we can change the way households believe and think, we can change the way communities believe and think. 
And if we can change enough communities, we can change national attitudes. 
We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. 
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction. 
We have the medicines, we have the tests, but how do you reduce the stigma? 
And it's important about disclosure. 
So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back, and she told me a story. 
And so the mentor mother went along with. 
And everybody was quiet. 
And then her oldest brother stood up and said, "I too have something to tell you. 
I'm HIV-positive. 
I've been afraid to tell everybody." 
And then this older sister stood up and said, "I too am living with the virus, and I've been ashamed." 
And then her younger brother stood up and said, "I'm also positive. 
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family." 
And you see where this is going. 
The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive. 
I thought you were going to hate me." 
And there they were, all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time. 
I tell them my story, that I am HIV-positive, but my child is HIV-negative. 
I tell them, "You are going to make it, and you will raise a healthy baby." 
I am proof that there is hope. 
Mitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa. 
And it is a crisis in health care systems. 
Even as we have more tests and more drugs, we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers. 
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting. 
Task-shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. 
Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse. 
And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors, and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. 
How do you build a better health care system? 
We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother. 
And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs, the side effects. 
They delegate education about infant feeding, family planning, safer sex, actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. 
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission. 
The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health. 
And our organization helps women across that bridge. 
Our organization works on three levels. 
The second, communities -- empowering women. 
They become leaders within their communities. 
They change the way communities think -- we need to change attitudes to HIV. 
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. 
We have to do that. 
And then rework the level of the health care systems, building stronger health care systems. 
Our health care systems are broken. 
They're not going to work the way they're currently designed. 
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in, we can do that. 
I started the program in Capetown, South Africa back in 2001. 
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea. 
That is 20 percent of the global HIV-positive pregnant women -- 20 percent of the world. 
What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is. 
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV. 
Past patients taking care of present patients. 
And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma. 
Each person must know their HIV status. 
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative. 
Those who are HIV-infected must know how to take care of themselves. 
HIV-positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV-negative babies. 
All of this is possible, if we each contribute to this fight. 
MB: Simple solutions to complex problems. 
Mothers caring for mothers. 
It's transformational. 
Thank you. 
I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV/AIDS campaigner. 
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign. 
In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation -- that is his HIV/AIDS foundation. 
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island. 
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour, onstage, having the time of my life. 
You can see the bars of the window there. 
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us. 
I have to serve." 
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela, everyone reveres Nelson Mandela. 
I met him at a 46664 event. 
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now. 
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue. 
It doesn't have to be in the closet." 
It's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women, most of whom are HIV-positive. 
They work in the field. 
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus. 
They have education programs. 
They bring out the issues of stigma. 
It's quite extraordinary what they do. 
So this is my SING Campaign. 
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries. 
This is in the Scottish Parliament. 
I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV. 
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to, again, raise awareness. 
And once again, in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore. 
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus. 
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe -- he's the director of UNAIDS. 
And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAIDS ambassador. 
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach. 
It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will. 
This can happen. 
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life. 
It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic. 
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile. 
This is Avelile -- she goes with me wherever I go. 
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV/AIDS orphans. 
Avelile's mother had HIV virus -- she died from AIDS-related illness. 
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus. 
And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year-old baby. 
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia. 
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child. 
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal. 
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her. 
Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again. 
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you. 
This is the transformation that took place. 
Isn't it extraordinary? 
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation. 
I think that's fair to say, it's almost everyone in the hall. 
Thank you very much. 
My name is Mwende Katwiwa and I am a poet, a Pan-Africanist and a freedom fighter. 
I was 23 years old when I first heard about Reproductive Justice. 
Two: A woman's right to decide if she will not have a baby and her options for preventing or ending a pregnancy. 
I've always wanted to be a mother. 
Growing up, I heard all about the joys of motherhood. 
I used to dream of watching my womb weave wonder into this world. 
See, I knew I was young. 
But I figured, it couldn't hurt to start planning for something so big, so early. 
But now, I'm 26 years old. 
And I don't know if I have what it takes to stomach motherhood in this country. 
See, over the years, America has taught me more about parenting than any book on the subject. 
It has taught me how some women give birth to babies and others to suspects. 
There is something about being Black in America that has made motherhood seem complicated. 
Seem like, I don't know what to do to raise my kids right and keep them alive. 
Do I even want the police to come? 
Too many Sean Bells go off in my head when I consider calling 911. 
I will not take it for Oscar Grant-ed that they will not come and kill my son. 
As a historical reminder that there is something about being Black in America that has made motherhood sound like mourning. 
Sound like one morning I could wake up and see my son as a repeat of last week's story. 
Sound like I could wake up and realize the death of my daughter wouldn't even be newsworthy. 
So you can't tell me that Sandra Bland is the only Black woman whose violence deserves more than our silence. 
What about our other dark-skinned daughters in distress whose deaths we have yet to remember? 
What about our children whose lives don't fit neatly between the lives of your genders? 
See, apparently, nothing is a great protector if you come out of a body that looks like this. 
See, there is something about being Black in America that has made motherhood sound like something I'm not sure I look forward to. 
But I do not want to be a mother who gave birth to poems. 
No. 
I do not want children who will live forever in the pages of poetry, yet can't seem to outlive me. 
But for me, poetry is not about art and performance. 
It is a form of protest. 
That maybe I should cut down my TED Talk so it could "just" be about Reproductive Justice. 
But that poem and this talk is fundamentally about my inability to separate the two. 
What does motherhood really mean, when for so many who look like me it is synonymous with mourning? 
Without realizing it, I had begun to link the Reproductive Justice framework and the Movement for Black Lives. 
I found myself asking: Whose job is it in times like this to connect ideas realities and people? 
I want to dedicate this talk and that poem to Constance Malcolm. 
She is the mother of Ramarley Graham who was another Black child who was murdered before their time. 
Recently, Toni Morrison wrote, "In times of dread, artists must never choose to remain silent. 
There is no time for self-pity, no room for fear." 
Fearful that again our stories were being denied the very stages they deserve to be told on. 
And then I remembered the words I had just spoken. 
"In times of dread, artists must never choose to remain silent. 
There is no time for self-pity. 
And no room for fear." 
And I have made my choice. 
And I am always choosing. 
Thank you. 
I am a PhD student. 
And that means I have a question: How can we make digital content graspable? 
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now. 
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there -- it's virtual. 
On the other hand, we're humans, we live in a physical world. 
It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good. 
So the question is: How do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical? 
That's my question. 
The question is: What's next? 
Now, I have three options that I would like to show you. 
The first one is mass. 
As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. 
So could we use that in mobile phones? 
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile. 
We shift the gravitational center of it. 
For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass. 
So you move around the content on the display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. 
Another thing it's good for is navigation. 
It can guide you around in a city. 
It can tell you by its weight, "OK, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here." 
Now, mass is the first thing -- the second thing, that's shape. 
We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in our hands. 
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right? 
But if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" -- it's thick. 
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box, and this one can change its shape. 
We can play with the shape itself. 
For example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be. 
But then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick. 
It's like tapered to the downside. 
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that. 
It stands. 
Another thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone that are bigger than the phone itself. 
You can't see it, but it's there." 
The shape is the second thing. 
The third thing operates on a different level. 
As humans, we are social, we are empathic, and that's great. 
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive? 
Think of a hamster in the pocket. 
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right. I don't have to check it. 
So, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box. 
But this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic. 
Oh, now -- missed call, a new call, new girlfriend, maybe -- very exciting. 
You give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again. 
That's very intuitive, and that's what we want. 
So what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us. 
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that. 
The Hindus say, "Nada brahma," one translation of which is, "The world is sound." 
And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating. 
In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. 
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. 
So you are, in fact, a chord -- each of you an individual chord. 
One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. 
Your ears can't hear that chord; they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves. 
Incidentally, we see just one octave. 
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids. 
They work even when you sleep. 
The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. 
The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. 
Ears are made not for hearing, but for listening. 
And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught. 
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions, places you can listen from? 
Here are two of them. 
Reductive listening is listening "for." 
It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant. 
Men typically listen reductively. 
So he's saying, "I've got this problem." 
He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next." 
That's the way we talk, right guys? 
Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening "with," not listening "for." 
It's got no destination in mind -- it's just enjoying the journey. 
Women typically listen expansively. 
If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other, possibly both talking at the same time. 
The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise, surrounding us all the time. 
Noise like this, according to the European Union, is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of Europe. 
Two percent of the population of Europe -- that's 16 million people -- are having their sleep devastated by noise like that. 
Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe. 
It's a really big problem. 
These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler. 
It looks a bit like this. 
The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. 
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined: "schizophonia." 
It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. 
So, we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us. 
I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. 
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. 
We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. 
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music. 
There is a cost of compression. 
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data. 
You're having to imagine it. 
It's not good for you in the long run. 
The third problem with headphones is this: deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder. 
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. 
Now that's a really serious problem. 
Professional hearing protectors are great; I use some all the time. 
If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice, it's too loud. 
Protect your ears in that way. 
Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out. 
Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this. 
Silence is beautiful. 
The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence. 
I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. 
Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion. 
It's fun to get into designing with sound. 
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you. 
Sound design is the future, and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. 
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health. 
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy; it's also now being used to treat cancer. 
Sound healing is a wonderful modality. 
It's been around for thousands of years. 
I do urge you to explore this. 
There are great things being done there, treating now autism, dementia and other conditions. 
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good. 
There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. 
And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. 
First of all, listen consciously. 
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. 
It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension. 
Secondly, get in touch with making some sound -- create sound. 
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true. 
You can do this in groups as well. 
And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. 
Protect your ears? Yes, absolutely. 
Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work. 
So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. 
So I urge you to take that path. 
I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you. 
I wish you sound health. 
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m. 
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m. 
I was awakened once during the night. 
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute -- my blood pressure, 127 over 74. 
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday, so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated. 
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine, zero of alcohol. 
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index, or the NPI-16, is a reassuring 0.31. 
We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search. 
People were tracking their food via Twitter, their kids' diapers on their iPhone. 
They were making detailed journals of their spending, their mood, their symptoms, their treatments. 
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer. 
It tracks your movement through space. 
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap. 
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece, and they're going into all kinds of devices. 
But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this. 
This tracks your activity and also your sleep. 
It has just that sensor in it. 
You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system. 
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor. 
It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell. 
And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor. 
This is the strap that people use to transmit heart-rate data to their Nike+ system. 
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there. 
And this is the sleep tracking system of today. 
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C. 
Here's a biometric device: a pair of Apple Earbuds. 
What is this for? 
What should it be for? 
Some people will say it's for biometric security. 
Some people will say it's for public health research. 
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research. 
I'd like to tell you that it's also for self-knowledge. 
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things. 
The self is just our operation center, our consciousness, our moral compass. 
So, if we want to act more effectively in the world, we have to get to know ourselves better. 
Thank you. 
We live in in a remarkable time, the age of genomics. 
Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA. 
Your sequence and mine are slightly different. 
That's why we look different. 
I've got brown eyes; you might have blue or gray. 
But it's not just skin-deep. 
The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases, maybe even shape our personality, or give us mental disorders. 
Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies. 
And yet, I would like to think that I am more than my genes. 
What do you guys think? 
Are you more than your genes? 
I think some people agree with me. 
I think we should make a statement. 
I think we should say it all together. 
All right: "I'm more than my genes" -- all together. 
Everybody: I am more than my genes. 
Now, since you guys are really great, maybe you can humor me and say this all together too. 
Everybody: I am my connectome. 
SS: That sounded great. 
You know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is, and you're willing to play along with me. 
I could just go home now. 
Well, so far only one connectome is known, that of this tiny worm. 
Its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons. 
And in the 1970s and '80s, a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons. 
In this diagram, every node is a neuron, and every line is a connection. 
This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans. 
There's a diagram like this for your brain, but there's no way it would fit on this slide. 
Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters. 
That's a lot of information. 
What's in that information? 
We don't know for sure, but there are theories. 
And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis: I am my connectome. 
I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true; I just want you to remember it. 
Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor. 
Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before. 
You can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes. 
They extend long and delicate branches, and in short, they look like trees. 
But this is just a single neuron. 
In order to find connectomes, we have to see all the neurons at the same time. 
So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri, who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University. 
Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain. 
Except, you still may not really recognize them, and that's because we have to work in three dimensions. 
If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up, we get a three-dimensional image. 
And still, you may not see the branches. 
And we keep on doing that, slice after slice. 
And we can do that for another neuron in green. 
And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations, and these are what are called synapses. 
Let's zoom in on one synapse, and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron. 
You should see small circles -- these are called vesicles. 
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter. 
And so when the green neuron wants to communicate, it wants to send a message to the red neuron, it spits out neurotransmitter. 
At the synapse, the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone. 
So you see how to find a synapse. 
How can we find an entire connectome? 
Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book. 
If we can do that throughout all the images, we could find a connectome. 
Now, at this point, you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses. 
Girls' brains are like spaghetti; everything in their life is connected to everything else. 
You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement? 
It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl, everyone's brains are like spaghetti. 
Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches. 
One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons, because there can be synapses at these points of contact. 
By now, you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is. 
And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you. 
I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side. 
So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron. 
And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube. 
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain. 
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain. 
Neuroscience is hopeless." 
And, as a scientist, I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings -- too much information, professor. 
Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite? 
It's absurd. 
How could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this? 
And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor. 
And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes. 
Someday, a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images. 
And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome. 
It will take the work of generations to succeed. 
But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome. 
As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood, your personal identity changes slowly. 
Likewise, every connectome changes over time. 
What kinds of changes happen? 
Well, neurons, like trees, can grow new branches, and they can lose old ones. 
Synapses can be created, and they can be eliminated. 
And synapses can grow larger, and they can grow smaller. 
Second question: what causes these changes? 
Well, it's true. 
To some extent, they are programmed by your genes. 
These signals are called neural activity. 
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change. 
And if you put those two facts together, it means that your experiences can change your connectome. 
And that's why every connectome is unique, even those of genetically identical twins. 
The connectome is where nature meets nurture. 
What's in this picture? 
A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say. 
What else is in this picture? 
Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed. 
Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow. 
And with the stream, I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity. 
Neural activity is constantly changing. 
It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still. 
The connections of the brain's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows. 
And as I told you just now, neural activity can change the connectome. 
And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness. 
Neural activity is its water, and the connectome is its bed. 
So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science. 
Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work. 
How will we go about testing the hypothesis "I am my connectome?" 
Well, I propose a direct test. 
Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes. 
Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements, like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata. 
And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements. 
So one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes. 
But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this. 
They're going to be scrambled up. 
So we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain. 
And if that were successful, that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome. 
I hope not. 
But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake. 
The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain. 
Can anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain? 
I'll give you a hint. It's a big number. 
And if you appreciate that number, you can easily see there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain. 
And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like, "Anorexic brains are wired differently," or "Autistic brains are wired differently." 
Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication. 
Philosophers know this game very well. 
One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics. 
Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality, calling them fools? 
Or will they someday chuckle over our graves? 
I don't know -- I prefer to test their beliefs, scientifically. 
I propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain. 
We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing. 
The question is: has that damage erased the connectome? 
Resurrection might succeed for the body, but not for the mind. 
On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact, we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily. 
I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small, and propels us to the world of the far future. 
Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history. 
As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors on the African savanna, what distinguished us was our larger brains. 
We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies. 
Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains. 
I believe that this voyage of self-discovery is not just for scientists, but for all of us. 
And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today. 
Thank you. 
So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst, and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance, on an assignment for Medica Mondiale. 
Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture. 
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, and 70 percent of the people are illiterate. 
War and malnutrition kills people together with hope. 
Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations. 
One figure for that: 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition. 
Yet, there is hope. 
So, doctors prescribe medication. 
And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads. 
Military collect weapons, and depression stays intact. 
Why? 
Because people don't have tools to cope with it, to get over it. 
However, what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds -- they are universal. 
This was very important, because the family is central in Afghans' social system. 
No one can survive alone. 
And very often violence is a way to cope with it. 
So, husbands start beating wives, mothers and fathers beat their children, and afterward, they feel awful. 
They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control. 
And partly this is already happening. 
So everybody needs a sense for the future, and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered. 
But let me repeat the words of the woman. 
"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again." 
So the key here is empathy. 
Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you. 
Somebody has to feel how you felt. 
And somebody has to see you and listen to you. 
So something can be done, even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan. 
And I started thinking about a counseling program. 
But, of course, I needed help and funds. 
And I explained to him quickly, I would train psycho-social counselors, I would open centers, and I explained to him why. 
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany. 
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted, and we had 45 all over Kabul. 
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that. 
And 70 percent regained their lives. 
This was a very exciting time, developing this with my wonderful Afghan team. 
And they are working with me up to today. 
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach. 
So, from 2008 up until today, a substantial change and step forward has been taking place. 
This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff. 
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective. 
And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression, moderate and severe. 
And the red line is the treatment as usual -- medication with a medical doctor. 
And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse. 
And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only, without medication. 
So this makes us very happy, because now we also have some evidence that this is working. 
So here you see, this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan, and every morning it looks like this all over. 
And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients, but now this will change. 
And I would like to share one short vignette. 
And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future." 
So I believe this kept me running. 
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation. 
And also -- I think -- without psycho-social therapy, and without considering this in all humanitarian projects, we cannot build-up civil societies. 
I thank you for your attention. 
But evolutionarily, two million years is nothing. 
And yet, in two million years, the human brain has nearly tripled in mass, going from the one-and-a-quarter-pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis, to the almost three-pound meatloaf everybody here has between their ears. 
Well, it turns out when brains triple in size, they don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures. 
Well, it turns out the prefrontal cortex does lots of things, but one of the most important things it does is it's an experience simulator. 
Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes. 
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. 
This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do, and that no other animal can do quite like we can. 
It's a marvelous adaptation. 
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have "liver and onion" ice cream, and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck!" 
Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. 
Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate. 
You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer. 
One of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars. 
And the other is becoming paraplegic. 
You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought. 
Interestingly, there are data on these two groups of people, data on how happy they are. 
And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it? 
But these aren't the data. I made these up! 
These are the data. 
You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture. 
Because happiness can be synthesized. 
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, "I am the happiest man alive. 
I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity. 
I am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me." 
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head? 
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all of us have. 
Unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it. 
We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found. 
I took a copy of the "New York Times" and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. 
Here are three guys synthesizing happiness. 
"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience." 
"I believe it turned out for the best." 
Who are these characters who are so damn happy? 
The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything: he lost his money, he lost his power. 
What does he have to say all these years later about it? 
"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally and in almost every other way." 
What other way would there be to be better off? 
Vegetably? Minerally? Animally? 
He's pretty much covered them there. 
Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of. 
Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released. 
He was ultimately [released for good behavior halfway through his sentence.] What did he have to say about his experience? 
"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience." 
Glorious! 
This guy's not saying, "There were some nice guys. They had a gym." 
So he went to find them. 
They said, "We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks." 
He wouldn't lend him the money. 
Of course, six months later, Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea. 
And then, finally, some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best, who was the original drummer for the Beatles, until they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. 
OK, there's something important to be learned from these people, and it is the secret of happiness. 
Here it is, finally to be revealed. 
First: accrue wealth, power and prestige, then lose it. 
And in our society, we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind. 
Why do we have that belief? 
Now, I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric, but by marinating you in a little bit of data. 
This isn't mine, it's a 50-year-old paradigm called the "free choice paradigm." 
It's very simple. 
You bring in, say, six objects, and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked. 
In this case, because this experiment uses them, these are Monet prints. 
Now we give you a choice: "We happen to have some extra prints in the closet. 
We're going to give you one as your prize to take home. 
We happen to have number three and number four," we tell the subject. 
What happens? 
This is the result that's been replicated over and over again. 
You're watching happiness be synthesized. 
Would you like to see it again? 
Happiness! 
"The one I got is really better than I thought! 
That's the synthesis of happiness. 
"Yeah, right!" 
We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia. 
These are hospitalized patients. 
Most of them have Korsakoff syndrome, a polyneuritic psychosis. 
They drank way too much, and they can't make new memories. 
They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room, when you come back, they don't know who you are. 
We took our Monet prints to the hospital. 
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four. 
We explained we would have number three mailed to them. 
We gathered up our materials, and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour. 
The patients, bless them, say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry, I've got a memory problem; that's why I'm here. 
If I've met you before, I don't remember." 
"Really, Jim, you don't remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?" 
"No problem, Jim. 
What do they do? 
Well, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac. 
We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own, which one they chose last time, which one is theirs. 
And what we find is, amnesiac patients just guess. 
But if I do this with amnesiac patients, they don't have a clue. 
They can't pick their print out of a lineup. 
Here's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness. Right? 
This is the change in liking score, the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked. 
Normal controls show -- that was the magic I showed you; now I'm showing it to you in graphical form -- "The one I own is better than I thought. 
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result. 
"Yeah, right" is not the right response! 
They're not just saying it because they own it, because they don't know they own it. 
When psychologists show you bars, you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. 
And yet, all of us have this psychological immune system, this capacity to synthesize happiness, but some of us do this trick better than others. 
And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do. 
"My printer prints a blank page after every document." 
"Why complain about getting free paper?" 
"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?" 
"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper! 
Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!" 
"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!" 
"What are you doing?" 
"I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change." Indeed. 
This is the difference between dating and marriage. 
You go out on a date with a guy, and he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date. 
You're married to a guy and he picks his nose? 
He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake! 
You find a way to be happy with what's happened. 
We created a black-and-white photography course, and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom. 
We now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms, and they blow two of them up. 
"I have to give one up?" 
"Yes, we need one as evidence of the class project. 
So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice. 
You get to keep one, and I get to keep one." 
Now, there are two conditions in this experiment. 
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email. 
Better yet, I'll check with you. 
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic. 
You will never see it again." 
Look at what we find. 
First of all, here's what students think is going to happen. 
They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind. 
Because here's what's really happening. 
And people who are deliberating -- "Should I return it? 
Maybe this isn't the good one. Maybe I left the good one?" -- have killed themselves. 
They don't like their picture. 
In fact, even after the opportunity to swap has expired, they still don't like their picture. 
Why? 
So here's the final piece of this experiment. 
We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course, and we can do it one of two ways. 
Is there really nothing good or bad? 
Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing? 
They can't be exactly the same. 
In more turgid prose, but closer to the truth, was the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this. 
In other words: yes, some things are better than others. 
We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. 
When our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully. 
When our ambition is unbounded, it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others, to sacrifice things of real value. 
When our fears are bounded, we're prudent, we're cautious, we're thoughtful. 
Thank you. 
Welcome to Thailand. 
We decided to do something about it, but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program. 
But we began with a family-planning program, following a very successful maternal child health activity, sets of activities. 
So basically, no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive. 
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers, and then follow up with family planning. 
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning. 
Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. 
In my country, that was the case in 1974. 
Seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent. 
There was just no future. 
We needed to reduce the population growth rate. 
So we said, "Let's do it." 
We didn't take no as an answer; we took no as a question. 
That was wonderful, but it covered only 20 percent of the country. 
What do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel." 
No, we decided to do a bit more. 
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw. 
Actually, below that yellow sign -- I wish they hadn't wiped that, because there was "Coca-Cola" there. 
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days. 
And no difference, the people they chose were the people we chose. 
So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country, in every village of the country. 
So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution. 
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?" 
And this picture was sent throughout the country. 
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves. 
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects. 
It's been blessed." 
That was their perception. 
And then we went to teachers. 
So we went to the teachers. 
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice. 
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead. 
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night. 
Very good, mother. Move ahead. 
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead. 
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again." 
And the kids were doing it in school too. 
We had relay races with condoms, we had children's condom-blowing championship. 
And before long, the condom was know as the girl's best friend. 
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it -- so the condom is the girl's best friend. 
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy. 
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us." 
And that was run by them. 
And after 35/36 years, it's still going on. 
It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit. 
And we didn't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves. 
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there, it's always women, women, women, women. 
And then we thought we'd help America, because America's been helping everyone, whether they want help or not. 
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it -- very appropriate room. 
Of course, it must be American cola. 
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi. 
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog." 
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic. 
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy. 
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also. 
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you." 
In all this thing, from seven children to 1.5 children, population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5. 
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing. 
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola, but we're good friends. 
And so that's the case of everyone joining in. 
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors. 
But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior. 
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand, and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS. 
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial. 
So our work wasn't affected. 
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military." 
So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations. 
They have more than the government, and they've got more guns than the government. 
So I asked them, could they help us in our fight against HIV. 
And after I gave them statistics, they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations." 
And that's when we went onto the airwaves. 
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that. 
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?" 
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot. 
So I said, "Okay." 
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold. 
And here, every media person had to be trained for HIV. 
And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money. 
So they were happy with that. 
And then AIDS education in all schools, starting from university. 
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. 
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys, and they were terrific. 
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. 
And then we went down one more step. 
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives, and this was a lifesaver. 
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved." 
So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy. 
So they all trained. 
And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots. 
And they loved him. You need a symbol of something. 
In taxis, you get condoms. 
And also, in traffic, the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs. 
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely; I see them standing around right now, everywhere. 
Imagine if they had condoms, giving out to all sorts of people. 
And then, new change, we had hair bands, clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season. 
One says, "Weapon of mass protection." 
We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom. 
And then it says here, with the American flag, "Don't leave home without it." 
But I have some to give out afterward. 
But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized, so be very careful. 
Look at this -- I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also. 
Stop global warming; use condoms. 
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection. 
And let the next Olympics save some lives. 
Why just run around? 
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools, because alcohol impairs judgment. 
And then what happened? 
After all this time, everybody joined in. 
According to the U.N., new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent, and according to the World Bank, 7.7 million lives were saved. 
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today. 
So it just showed you, you could do something about it. 
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand. 
There was political commitment, some financial commitment, and everybody joined in the fight. 
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses. 
We all need to help. 
Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit. 
Those are the things to be provided by the business community. 
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs, little business people. 
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise. 
So, that was done. 
The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting. 
It's not a free gift. 
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank. 
Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in. 
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained. 
And we believe if you want to help the poor, those who are living in poverty, access to credit must be a human right. 
Access to credit must be a human right. 
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty. 
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained. 
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes. 
Make these better, because we can afford them." 
And then we have silk, Thai silk. 
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left, to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors. 
So anyone sitting in and watching TV, get in touch with me. 
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand -- "Coffee and Condoms." 
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive. 
That's the difference. 
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms? 
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. 
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development. 
And it's a center, a focal point for economic and social development. 
Re-do the school, make it serve the community needs. 
And here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo. 
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo. 
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome. 
And we use vegetables around the school ground, so they raise their own vegetables. 
Of course, child mortality first and then family planning -- everyone needs family planning service -- it's underutilized. 
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection. 
And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives. 
And then, finally, that is our network. 
And these are our Thai tulips. 
This is a material you all know is Styrofoam, but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff. 
Yet, after just a few weeks of use, you'll throw this material in the trash. 
And this isn't just found in packaging. 
And that's not the only place it's found. 
The EPA estimates, in the United States, by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills. 
They're not biologically compatible. 
They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems. 
You'll find it inside of you. 
The first is feedstocks. 
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. 
I say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it. 
We should be talking about half, a quarter, one-tenth the energy content. 
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years. 
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years. 
This is crazy. 
But nature provides us with a really good model here. 
And this gets us back to the mushrooms. 
Because in nature, mushrooms are the recycling system. 
Now, mycelium is an amazing material, because it's a self-assembling material. 
In our process, we basically use it as a glue. 
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts, not petroleum. 
And because they're made of natural materials, they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard. 
So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials. 
The final step is, of course, the product, whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block. 
Our vision is local manufacturing, like the local food movement, for production. 
So we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts. 
If you're in China, you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull. 
If you're in Northern Europe or North America, you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls. 
We then process these husks with some basic equipment. 
So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case. 
It's a waste product. 
And it's when this lid goes on the part, that the magic really starts. 
Because the manufacturing process is our organism. 
It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and, over the next five days, assemble them into biocomposites. 
So I've said a number of times that we grow materials. 
And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens. 
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth, a typical growth cycle for us, and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse. 
This matrix self-assembles, growing through and around the particles, making millions and millions of tiny fibers. 
And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest, actually become part of the final, physical composite. 
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled. 
It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days. 
But it's much faster than conventional farming. 
The last step, of course, is application. 
In this case, we've grown a corner block. 
A major Fortune 500 furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment. 
Best of all, when it gets to the customer, it's not trash. 
They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing, and it's going to improve the local soil. 
So, why mycelium? 
The first reason is local open feedstocks. 
The next is self-assembly, because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. 
You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. 
So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world. 
Biological yield is really important. 
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great. 
And I think that can be some really good news. 
Thank you. 
I want to talk to you today about prosperity, about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity. 
And not just us, but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished. 
And hope actually is at the heart of this. 
"Pro-speras," "speras," hope -- in accordance with our hopes and expectations. 
The irony is, though, that we have cashed-out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. 
And recession, of course, isn't exactly a recipe for hope either, as we're busy finding out. 
So we're caught in a kind of trap. 
It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth. 
We can't live with it; we can't live without it. 
Trash the system or crash the planet -- it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice. 
Now I haven't got anything against efficiency. 
And I think we are a clever species sometimes. 
But I think we should also just check the numbers, take a reality check here. 
And I want to ask the question: how far and how fast would be have to move? 
How clever would we have to be? 
How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets? 
And here in my chart -- on the left-hand side is where we are now. 
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. 
It's around about 770 grams of carbon. 
In the world I describe to you, we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon. 
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows? 
But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement? 
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. 
It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that. 
What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms. 
So it looks a little bit like this. 
That's called the circular flow of the economy. 
It looks harmless enough. 
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system, which is the role of investment. 
And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth. 
But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty, the production and consumption of novelty. 
Joseph Schumpeter called this "the process of creative destruction." 
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty, continually chasing expanding consumer markets, consumer goods, new consumer goods. 
We love new stuff -- new material stuff for sure -- but also new ideas, new adventures, new experiences. 
Status-driven, conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty. 
Adam Smith, 200 years ago, spoke about our desire for a life without shame. 
And even if we don't want them, we need to buy them, because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes. 
And of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis. 
But this -- I just want to show you some data here. 
This is what it looks like, essentially, this credit and debt system, just for the U.K. 
This was the last 15 years before the crash, and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically. 
It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. 
And in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted. 
The savings ratio, net savings, were below zero in the middle of 2008, just before the crash. 
This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings, just to stay in the game. 
This is a strange, rather perverse, story, just to put it in very simple terms. 
Is this really how people are? 
Is this really how economies behave?" 
And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies. 
The first one is in the crisis itself. 
In the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do? 
They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future. 
They want to spend less and save more. 
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view. 
Keynes called this the "paradox of thrift" -- saving slows down recovery. 
These things save carbon, they save energy, they save us money. 
So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense, we don't do them? 
Well, I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago. 
And my, then, five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do. 
You can hear the five-year-old mind working. 
These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria. 
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather. 
"What is the objective of the consumer?" 
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written 35 years ago. 
"It is," she said, "to help create the social world and find a credible place in it." 
So who are we? 
Who are these people? 
Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic, selfish individuals? 
Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here? 
Well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. 
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots, so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -- fight or flight. 
But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings. 
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view, another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation. 
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself. 
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups. 
So here, all of a sudden, we're looking at a map of the human heart. 
And it reveals to us, suddenly, the crux of the matter. 
What we've done is we've created economies. 
We've created systems, which systematically privilege, encourage, one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded. 
And in the same token, the solution becomes clear, because this isn't, therefore, about changing human nature. 
It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities. 
It is about opening up. 
What does all this mean for economics? 
And I just want to, very quickly, show you this. 
Ecosia is an Internet search engine. 
Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search. 
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way. 
So we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term. 
There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up. 
And we're going to do it. 
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. 
It's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources. 
It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy. 
It's a form, if you like, of ecological altruism -- perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that. 
Only now, investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth. 
Investment has to be a different beast. 
Investment has to be, in the new economy, protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends. 
It has to be about transition. 
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures. 
We have to invest, in fact, in the idea of a meaningful prosperity, providing capabilities for people to flourish. 
And of course, this task has material dimensions. 
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter. 
But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this. 
It has social and psychological aims -- family, friendship, commitments, society, participating in the life of that society. 
And we need that relationship to reflect, to reclaim hope. 
What can we offer those people? 
It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty. 
So this is not just a Western post-materialist fantasy. 
Ubuntu says, "I am because we are." 
Prosperity is a shared endeavor. 
Its roots are long and deep -- its foundations, I've tried to show, exist already, inside each of us. 
So this is not about standing in the way of development. 
It's not about overthrowing capitalism. 
It's not about trying to change human nature. 
What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose. 
And at the heart of that economics, we're placing a more credible, more robust, and more realistic vision of what it means to be human. 
Thank you very much. 
First of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring, so you may need to work on the tone a little. 
I mean, can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying, "GDP fell two percent this year. Good news! 
We're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful, and our lives are better." 
Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing. 
You're not making news out of things falling down. 
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing. 
Can I picture politicians doing it? 
Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it. 
CA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together, or is it going to be more just civil society and companies? 
TJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society. 
But it has to have political leadership. 
If you can convince me we can do all that, then, yes, I would take the two percent. 
CA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk. Thank you. 
I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty, form and function of giant bluefin tuna. 
Bluefin are warmblooded like us. 
They're the largest of the tunas, the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish. 
They actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal. 
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming. 
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift, powers its movements with a lunate tail. 
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water. 
This is what one of nature's finest machines. 
Now, bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history. 
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France. 
They're on coins that date back 3,000 years. 
This fish was revered by humankind. 
It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation. 
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on Earth, and this is a gold rush for bluefin. 
There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. 
Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan. 
Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin. 
They're delectable muscle, rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious. 
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death. 
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple. 
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small. 
The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton. 
For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas. 
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. 
These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries. 
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. 
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room. 
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. 
And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works. 
Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea. 
We don't know where the structure is. 
We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. 
We can't see the corridors, and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross. 
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. 
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm. 
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. 
So the story of our team, a dedicated team, is fish and chips. 
We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips. 
We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. 
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years. 
I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean, put it behind glass, and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display. 
We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity. 
They're flying through their space, ocean space. 
And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty. 
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
Here, for over 14 or 15 years, we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity. 
We'd been studying these fish, but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. 
What do they like to eat? 
What is it that they're happy with? 
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place. 
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption, its energy consumption. 
We're taking this data and building better models. 
So take a look at that animal. 
That's the closest you'll probably ever get. 
Now, the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean. 
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain. 
We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas. 
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas. 
And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas. 
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet. 
We bring the tuna out, we measure it. 
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen. 
And when it goes, we're always happy. 
We see a flick of the tail. 
Now sometimes the tunas are really large, such as this fish off Nantucket. 
But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged. 
It takes a human effort, a team effort, to bring the fish in. 
In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna. 
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. 
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. 
These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America. 
They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today. 
One community in general has given more to help us than any other community. 
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina. 
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish. 
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample. 
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there. 
And this is my favorite. 
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna. 
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean. 
The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine. 
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico. 
Three tunas tagged. 
Astronomically, we're calculating positions. 
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex -- and there it is. 
That is where the tuna spawn. 
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side. 
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med. 
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations. 
This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward. 
So we can then predict where management places should be. 
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured. 
These become forthright in places we need to protect. 
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna. 
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message. 
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna. 
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data. 
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag. 
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer. 
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey. 
It's a several thousand-pound animal. 
And we'll wind in the target. 
And now, together, what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature, we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks. 
We have white sharks and blue sharks. 
For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go. 
These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data. 
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small, we can actually see these journeys. 
You can see why they might be caught. 
And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey. 
So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. 
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean. 
And from this information, we can begin to map the hope spots. 
So this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data. 
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. 
And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us. 
They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters. 
They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles. 
Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles. 
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch. 
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. 
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits. 
And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean. 
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. 
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean. 
We just need to put it together. 
So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast. 
We have the technology that's shown us where it is. 
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. 
How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere? 
And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks. 
Make killer apps, if you will. 
A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. 
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone. 
That way we do away with a few internet myths. 
So we can save the bluefin tuna. 
We can save the white shark. 
We have the science and technology. 
Hope is here. Yes we can. 
We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans. 
Thank you. 
We are here today because [the] United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. 
They're called Millennium Development Goals. 
And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. 
There's a second reason I like these development goals, and that is because each and every one is measured. 
That's a four percent reduction per year -- and this, with measuring. 
So there's good news. 
But then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa. 
And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening." 
I'll prove them wrong on both points. 
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. 
And I will take Kenya as an example. 
Here you see the data. 
Don't panic -- don't panic now, I'll help you through this. 
It looks nasty, like in college when you didn't like statistics. 
But first thing, when you see dots like this, you have to ask yourself: from where do the data come? 
What is the origin of the data? 
No -- low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. 
What we rely on is not an incomplete system. 
We have interviews, we have surveys. 
How many children did you have? 
Are they alive? 
If they died, at what age and what year? 
But these surveys are costly, so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals. 
But they have good quality. 
So this is a limitation. 
And all these colored lines here are results; each color is one survey. 
This was 1977, 1988, 1992, '97 and 2002. 
And when the experts in the U.N. 
See here -- it's the best fit they can get of this point. 
But watch out -- they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. 
And they estimated that in 2008, Kenya had per child mortality of 128. 
And I was sad, because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s. 
It was so tragic. 
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys, and it showed good news from Kenya. 
I was so happy. 
This was the estimate of the new survey. 
Isn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah? 
So we celebrated. 
But now, when you have this trend line, how do we measure progress? 
I'm going into some details here, because [the] U.N. do it like this. 
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009. 
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress." 
That's unfair. 
As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently. 
I would say, at least do this -- 10 years is enough to follow the trend. 
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now. 
They have 2.4 percent. 
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya, I may have joined these two points. 
So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. 
We have a decent trend. 
It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. 
The HIV epidemic peaked. 
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs. 
We got, later, the mosquito netting. 
And there was socio-economic problems, which are now being solved at a much better scale. 
So look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa. 
And [the] U.N. says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent. 
Now this sounds a little theoretical, but it's not so theoretical. 
You know, these economists, they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow. 
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy. 
We in public health, we hate child death, so we want less and less and less of child deaths. 
So we calculate the percent reduction per year, but it's sort of the same percentage. 
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years? 
An economist would never do that. 
I have just divided it into two periods. 
In the 90s, only 1.2 percent, only 1.2 percent. 
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs. 
Still here, child death per 1,000 on that axis. 
Here we have [the] year. 
And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG. 
I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. 
I give you Congo, which was high, Ghana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower. 
And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go. 
But then, in the '80s, watch out here. 
Congo got into civil war, and they leveled off here. 
Ghana got very ahead, fast. 
That's where we are today. 
Time has come to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place. 
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different -- everyone knows that. 
And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing. 
So let me show the wider picture. 
My country, Sweden: 1800, we were up there. 
What a strange personality disorder we must have, counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. 
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. 
And then, you see, these were famine years. 
These were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden. 
My ancestors moved to the United States. 
And eventually, soon they started to get better and better here. 
And here we got better education, and we got health service, and child mortality came down. 
We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time. 
But look, the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast. 
Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early. 
We had primary school actually started in 1842. 
And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later. 
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long-term investments. 
It's not about just five years -- it's long-term investments. 
And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate, 3.1 percent when I calculated. 
So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is. 
But you don't talk about it so much. 
We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better. 
And I'll give you another story -- Egypt, the most hidden, glorious success in public health. 
Egypt was up here in 1960, higher than Congo. 
The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems. 
And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes, they increased education and they got primary health care. 
And down they went, you know. 
And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria. 
And isn't it a success story. 
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible. 
And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. 
Kenya is now speeding up. 
Here we have a problem. 
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. 
Now, let me now bring you to a wider picture, a wider picture of child mortality. 
The relationship between child mortality and family size. 
One, two, three, four children per woman: six, seven, eight children per woman. 
This is, once again, 1960 -- 50 years ago. 
Each bubble is a country -- the color, you can see, a continent. 
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa. 
And the size of the bubble is the population. 
And these are the so-called "developing" countries. 
They had high, or very high, child mortality and family size, six to eight. 
And the ones over there, they were so-called Western countries. 
They had low child mortality and small families. 
What has happened? 
I just want not to have any room for doubt -- you have to see that for yourself. 
This is what happened. Now I start the world. 
Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox, better education, health service. 
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here. 
And here Brazil is in the Western Box. 
India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box, and we get a lot a new neighbors. 
Welcome to a decent life. 
Come on. We want everyone down there. 
This is the vision we have, isn't it. 
And look now, the first African countries here are coming in. 
There we are today. 
There is no such thing as a "Western world" and "developing world." 
This is the report from [the] U.N., which came out on Friday. 
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" -- except this page. 
This page is very bad; it's a categorization of countries. 
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here -- developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea. 
Huh? 
They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country? 
They have here Singapore. 
They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore. 
They bypassed Sweden five years ago, and they are labeled a developing country. 
They have here Qatar. 
It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. 
How the heck could they be [a] developing country? 
This is crap. 
We have to have a modern concept, which fits to the data. 
And we have to realize that we are all going to into this, down to here. 
What is the importance now with the relations here. 
Look -- even if we look in Africa -- these are the African countries. 
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size, even within Africa. 
It's very clear that this is what happens. 
That's why we must have that long-term perspective, but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods. 
And of course, lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. 
It's a decent life for children, we are talking about. 
But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind, because it's about the environment. 
We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population. 
Let's be clear about that. 
And that is fully possible. Let's do it. 
Thank you very much. 
Imagine, if you will -- a gift. 
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. 
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball. 
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. 
It will bring all of your family together. 
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. 
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. 
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. 
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. 
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy. 
You'll expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you'll have a healthier lifestyle. 
And get this -- you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. 
You'll eat countless gourmet meals. 
Flowers will arrive by the truckload. 
People will say to you, "You look great. Have you had any work done?" 
And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. 
You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled. 
Your life will have new meaning. 
Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana. 
The price? 
$55,000, and that's an incredible deal. 
Does Amazon carry it? 
Does it have the Apple logo on it? 
Is there a waiting list? 
Not likely. 
This gift came to me about five months ago. 
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty. 
And this, and then this. 
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving. 
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you. 
I'm not sure you'd want it. 
But I wouldn't change my experience. 
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. 
Sometimes I go browsing [through] a very old magazine. 
I found this observation test about the story of the ark. 
And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors, had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes. 
Some of them are very easy. 
There is a funnel, an aerial part, a lamp and clockwork key on the ark. 
Some of them are about the animals, the number. 
But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. 
And this problem is: where are the plants? 
Why? 
Plants are not living creatures -- this is the point. 
That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible, but it's something that really accompanied humanity. 
Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. 
Here we have the description of the order of nature. 
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense, and on the top of the pyramid, there is the man. 
This is not the common man. 
The "Homo studiosus" -- the studying man. 
But it's something completely wrong. 
You know very well about professors. 
But it's also wrong about plants, because plants are not just able to live; they are able to sense. 
They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. 
Well, but this is something -- this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. 
Let's have a look at this short movie now. 
We have David Attenborough. 
Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover; he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. 
Now, when he speaks about plants, everything is correct. 
When he speaks about animals, [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist. 
The blue whale, the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong, completely wrong. 
They have just a kind of very low-level soul. 
It's called the vegetative soul, because they lack movement, and so they don't need to sense. 
Let's see. 
Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known. 
This is a very fast movement. 
This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap hunting snails -- sorry for the snail. 
This has been something that has been refused for centuries, despite the evidence. 
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal, because it was against the order of nature. 
But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. 
Some of them are very well known, like the flowering. 
It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. 
Some of them are much more sophisticated. 
Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. 
And it's really so graceful; it's like a dancing angel. 
They are also able to play -- they are really playing. 
These are young sunflowers, and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. 
But they are also able to sleep. 
This is one, Mimosa pudica. 
This is interesting because this sleeping machinery, it's perfectly conserved. 
It's the same in plants, in insects and in animals. 
It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. 
Plants are even able to communicate -- they are extraordinary communicators. 
They communicate with other plants. 
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin. 
So they need a vector -- and this vector, it's normally an animal. 
This is a serious business. 
Now, there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen. 
How is it possible to do this without a brain? 
We need to wait until 1880, when this big man, Charles Darwin, publishes a wonderful, astonishing book that starts a revolution. 
The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants." 
No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin. 
This is not a metaphor. 
Now, this is a root apex growing against a slope. 
And this region, it's a very small region -- it's less than one millimeter. 
We have almost 14 million roots. 
We have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area. 
Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others. 
Here were have on the left, the Internet and on the right, the root apparatus. 
They work in the same way. 
They are a network of small computing machines, working in networks. 
And why are they so similar? 
Because they evolved for the same reason: to survive predation. 
They work in the same way. 
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants [continue] to work. 
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet and it is [continuing] to work. 
And another possibility is a technological possibility. 
Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. 
Until now, the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. 
We have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals, insectoid, so on. 
We have the androids that are inspired by man. 
But why have we not any plantoid? 
Well, if you want to fly, it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds. 
We have another possibility we are working [on] in our lab, [which] is to build hybrids. 
It's much more easy to build hybrids. 
Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine. 
It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. 
They have computing power, they have electrical signals. 
The connection with the machine is much more easy, much more even ethically possible. 
Well, thank you for your attention. 
And before I finish, I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation. 
Thank you. 
But I also see lots of poverty, and it's quite jarring, both in the scale and the scope of it. 
So in short, I'm startled by all the things that they don't have. 
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola. 
Coke is everywhere. 
In fact, when I travel to the developing world, Coke feels ubiquitous. 
If they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing? 
And I'm not the first person to ask this question. 
But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn. 
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola. 
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day. 
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. 
So why does this matter? 
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke. 
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola. 
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product. 
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent, and they do incredible marketing. 
So let's start with the data. 
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit. 
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress. 
They have this very continuous feedback loop. 
They learn something, they put it back into the product, they put it back into the market. 
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight." 
It's a lot like other consumer companies. 
So if sales start to drop, then the person can identify the problem and address the issue. 
Let's contrast that for a minute to development. 
In development, the evaluation comes at the very end of the project. 
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark. 
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down. 
Real-time data turns on the lights. 
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at? 
They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent. 
And in Africa, the remote places, it's hard to find a good road. 
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that. 
And they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs, giving them small loans. 
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa. 
In Tanzania and Uganda, they represent 90 percent of Coke's sales. 
Let's look at the development side. 
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke? 
I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program. 
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country. 
They trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people. 
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people. 
Now, think about how this can change people's lives. 
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program. 
So what's the next step for Ethiopia? 
Well, they're already starting talk about this. 
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas? 
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages?" 
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential. 
The third component of Coke's success is marketing. 
Ultimately, Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola. 
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing? 
Well, it's aspirational. 
It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live. 
So even though it's a global company, they take a very local approach. 
Coke's global campaign slogan is "Open Happiness." 
But they localize it. 
And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect. 
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign. 
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist. 
Well, they didn't stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages. 
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries. 
Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity. 
So how does health and development market? 
Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations. 
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages. 
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS." 
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea." 
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me. 
And I think that's a mistake. 
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change. 
One example is sanitation. 
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. 
But there's a solution: you build a toilet. 
People reuse it for a slab for their home. 
They sometimes store grain in it. 
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop. 
Well, you work with the community. 
But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern, trendy convenience. 
One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship. 
And it works -- look at these headlines. 
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. 
No loo, no "I do." 
But more importantly, it saves lives. 
Take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband, Bill. 
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for? 
They're waiting to be circumcised. 
Can you you believe that? 
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men. 
Well, why is all of this so important? 
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together, when you tie the three things together. 
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples. 
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years. 
So if you look back to 1988, there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year. 
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases. 
Well how did that happen? 
Let's look at a country like India. 
They have two and a half million vaccinators. 
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. 
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor. 
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio. 
By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. 
Now it could have come from one of two places. 
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south. 
So many more people would have been affected. 
So what's the endgame? 
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio. 
They went out and where Shriram lives, they vaccinated two million people. 
So in less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program. 
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio. 
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing, but it might not be what you think. 
It's not the marketing on the ground. 
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community. 
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio. 
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. 
And if we could do that, we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide, in all of our countries for polio. 
And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet. 
And we are so close. 
And this victory is so possible. 
To me, that is deep happiness. 
Thank you. 
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype. 
My wife sent me a message, "Whoa, earthquake," and then disappeared for 25 minutes. 
It was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S. felt. 
We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti. 
This is the national palace -- the equivalent of the White House. 
This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. 
This is a nurses' college -- there are 300 nurses studying. 
The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. 
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance. 
We haven't heard about why the buildings failed. 
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades, and it was not a natural disaster -- it was a disaster of engineering. 
AIDG has worked in Haiti since 2007, providing engineering and business support to small businesses. 
We inspected schools and private residencies. 
We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. 
We inspected government buildings. 
This is the Ministry of Justice. 
Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. 
There is nothing here that we don't know. 
Now there's a solution to all these problems. 
And we know how to build properly. 
The proof of this came in Chile, almost a month later, when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile. 
Adjusted for population density, that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. 
What was the difference between Chile and Haiti? 
If you look at this building in Chile, it's ripped in half, but it's not a pile of rubble. 
Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades. 
This is Xantus Daniel; he's a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman, who took one of our trainings. 
On his last job he was working with his boss, and they started pouring the columns wrong. 
He took his boss aside, and he showed him the materials on confined masonry. 
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong. 
It won't cost us any more to do it the right way." 
And they redid that building. 
They tied the rebar right, they poured the columns right, and that building will be safe. 
And every building that they build going forward will be safe. 
Now there are many groups doing this. 
If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable. 
The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. 
My title: "Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science." 
This means that quantum theory has got to be, in some sense, true. 
It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it. 
And that's Richard Feynman. 
The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example. 
Science, as opposed to technology, does violence to common sense. 
"Queerer than we can suppose." 
What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything, and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose? 
Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp, but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence? 
Are there things about the universe that are, in principle, ungraspable by any mind, however superior? 
After all, it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless, the Sun, small and mobile. 
And his friend replied, "Well, obviously, because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth." 
Why, then, do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable? 
We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms. 
If we had, our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space. 
If they had, our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein. 
May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III, commander of military intelligence in 1983. 
"...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington, Virginia, and decided to do it. 
As frightening as the prospect was, he was going into the next office. 
He stood up and moved out from behind his desk. 
Then, General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office. 
Stubblebine, who commanded 16,000 soldiers, was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall. 
He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal. 
Who would screw around with an army that could do that?" 
That's from an article in Playboy, which I was reading the other day. 
If we'd evolved in a vacuum, we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously. 
If we were bacteria, constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules, it would be different. 
But we Middle-Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion. 
In the same way, our lives are dominated by gravity, but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension. 
A small insect would reverse these priorities. 
Steve Grand -- he's the one on the left, Douglas Adams is on the right. 
Steve Grand, in his book, "Creation: Life and How to Make It," is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself. 
We have this tendency to think that only solid, material things are really things at all. 
Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal. 
But we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World, where matter is a useful fiction. 
A whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality as a rock. 
In a desert plain in Tanzania, in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai, there's a dune made of volcanic ash. 
The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily. 
It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns. 
Steve Grand points out that you and I are, ourselves, more like a wave than a permanent thing. 
After all, you really were there at the time, weren't you? 
How else would you remember it? 
But here is the bombshell: You weren't there. 
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place. 
Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. 
Whatever you are, therefore, you are not the stuff of which you are made. 
So "really" isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence. 
We have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks. 
"Really," for an animal, is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival. 
And because different species live in different worlds, there will be a discomforting variety of "reallys." 
The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are. 
A flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking, climbing or swimming animal. 
A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks. 
A mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use. 
I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears. 
There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength. 
J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell. 
Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids, extremely diluted: caprylic acid and caproic acid. 
The only difference, you see, is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain. 
Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color. 
And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats. 
We're blind to all frequencies outside that, unless we use instruments to help us. 
We could make a similar scale of improbabilities; nothing is totally impossible. 
Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable. 
In this case, the hand would move, and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World. 
Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events; we don't live long enough. 
One way to think about that is by counting planets. 
And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability. 
And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince, and similar magical things like that. 
I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that, because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe. 
How shall we interpret "queerer than we can suppose?" 
I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other. 
We'd be different, our characters would be different, if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different. 
But we scientists are inconsistent. 
That's not what we say. 
We swim through a sea of people -- a social version of Middle World. 
We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists. 
Thank you very much. 
And what it is -- it's a twist on health. 
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health. 
Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error. 
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things. 
Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes-related issues. 
So all of those -- what's common about all of those? 
The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right. 
But, of course, affords greater throughput, fewer accidents, and an interesting model of social movement. 
What they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality. 
This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening. 
And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after. 
And so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?" 
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse -- a domestic partnership with mice? 
Very lucky. 
Mice, of course, are the quintessential model organism. 
They share your environmental stressors, the asbestos levels and lead levels, whatever you're exposed to. 
Mice are a very good representation. 
So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course. 
This is one of them. 
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky. 
Is anybody here on antidepressants? 
So do you think the mice self-administered antidepressants? 
This was vodka and solution, gin and solution. 
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. 
Where's our expert? 
They did, yes. 
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water, which was interesting. 
Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device. 
We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice. 
And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way. 
But we do have a few prescription products through this. 
It's very different from the medical model. 
And that aggregating effect, that collective action effect, is actually something we can use to our advantage. 
So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the No Park. 
This is a prescription to improve water quality. 
Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality. 
That doesn't do a lot of good. 
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though, there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. 
They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate. 
But if we did this in every single -- every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency. 
That 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there, it's infiltrating pollutants. 
It's also increasing fixing CO2s, sequestering some of the airborne pollutants. 
So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health. 
This is one of the more ambitious ones. 
And this is an interesting icon that happened -- you remember these: fallout shelters. 
What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis? 
This was civic mobilization. 
Churches, school groups, hospitals, private residents -- everyone built one of these in a matter of months. 
And they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat. 
You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that. 
So it's on legs, so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns. 
It's built as a barn raising, using open source hardware. 
This is the quarter-scale prototype that was functioning in Spain. 
This is what it will look like, fingers crossed, NYU willing. 
You understand a solar chimney. 
Hot air rises. 
What we do is actually put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that. 
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion, not from combustion itself. 
When we put it through our solar chimney, we remove actually about 95 percent of that. 
And then I swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black. 
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. 
Here's one of them that we have up now. 
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users. 
We are not alone; the animals are moving in. 
In fact, urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers. 
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal, elk in Westchester County. 
And every green space we create is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us. 
But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly. 
This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this. 
When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file. 
They said things like this. 
There's a good person. 
The birds were able to jump from one to the other. 
These are just your average urban pigeon. 
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick. 
That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu. 
Do you know what slows it down? 
Healthy sub-populations of birds, increasing biodiversity generally. 
It is in your interests that I'm healthy, happy, well-fed. 
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them. 
That is, share your lunch. 
When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on. 
This is what it looks like. 
So there's another function on here. 
And then you can also text the fish. 
So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details. 
And they text back. 
When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message. 
So updates from a beaver. 
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him. 
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish. 
They're delicious. 
They're cross-species delicious that is, delicious for humans and non-humans. 
But they also have a chelating agent in them. 
They're nutritionally appropriate, not like Doritos. 
And so every time that desire to interact with the animals, which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign: "Do not feed the animals." 
And there's about three of them on every New York City park. 
And Yellowstone National Park, there's more "do not feed the animals" signs than there are animals you might wish to feed. 
Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues. 
And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated. 
Thank you. 
There is a moment on the birthing table that feels like dying. 
The body in labor stretches to form an impossible circle. 
The contractions are less than a minute apart. 
Wave after wave, there is barely time to breathe. 
The medical term: "transition," because "feels like dying" is not scientific enough. 
During my transition, my husband was pressing down on my sacrum to keep my body from breaking. 
My father was waiting behind the hospital curtain ... 
more like hiding. 
But my mother was at my side. 
The midwife said she could see the baby's head, but all I could feel was a ring of fire. 
I turned to my mother and said, "I can't," but she was already pouring my grandfather's prayer in my ear. 
"The hot winds cannot touch you." 
"You are brave," she said. 
"You are brave." 
And suddenly I saw my grandmother standing behind my mother. 
And her mother behind her. 
And her mother behind her. 
A long line of women who had pushed through the fire before me. 
I took a breath; I pushed; my son was born. 
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine. 
My mother had never stopped laboring for me, from my birth to my son's birth. 
She already knew what I was just beginning to name. 
That love is more than a rush of feeling that happens to us if we're lucky. 
Love is sweet labor. 
Fierce. 
Bloody. 
Imperfect. 
Life-giving. 
A choice we make over and over again. 
And in our most painful moments, in the face of the fires of injustice, I have seen labors of love deliver us. 
Now, if you cringe when people say, "Love is the answer ..." 
I do, too. 
My first encounter with hate was in the schoolyard. 
I was a little girl growing up in California, where my family has lived and farmed for a century. 
Papa Ji dried my tears -- gave me the words of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith. 
"I see no stranger," said Nanak. 
"I see no enemy." 
My grandfather taught me that I could choose to see all the faces I meet and wonder about them. 
And if I wonder about them, then I will listen to their stories even when it's hard. 
I will refuse to hate them even when they hate me. 
I will even vow to protect them when they are in harm's way. 
That's what it means to be a Sikh: S-i-k-h. 
To walk the path of a warrior saint. 
He told me the story of the first Sikh woman warrior, Mai Bhago. 
The story goes there were 40 soldiers who abandoned their post during a great battle against an empire. 
You will return to the fire, and I will lead you." 
She mounted a horse. 
She donned a turban. 
And with sword in her hand and fire in her eyes, she led them where no one else would. 
She became the one she was waiting for. 
"Don't abandon your posts, my dear." 
My grandfather saw me as a warrior. 
I was a little girl in two long braids, but I promised. 
And these turbans meant to represent our commitment to serve cast us as terrorists. 
And Sikhs became targets of hate, alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters. 
The first person killed in a hate crime after September 11 was a Sikh man, standing in front of his gas station in Arizona. 
Balbir Singh Sodhi was a family friend I called "uncle," murdered by a man who called himself "patriot." 
He is the first of many to have been killed, but his story -- our stories barely made the evening news. 
I didn't know what to do, but I had a camera, I faced the fire. 
I went to his widow, Joginder Kaur. 
I wept with her, and I asked her, "What would you like to tell the people of America?" 
I was expecting blame. 
But she looked at me and said, "Tell them, 'Thank you.' 3,000 Americans came to my husband's memorial. 
They did not know me, but they wept with me. 
Tell them, 'Thank you.'" Thousands of people showed up, because unlike national news, the local media told Balbir Uncle's story. 
Stories can create the wonder that turns strangers into sisters and brothers. 
This was my first lesson in revolutionary love -- that stories can help us see no stranger. 
And so ... 
my camera became my sword. 
My law degree became my shield. 
My film partner became my husband. 
And we became part of a generation of advocates working with communities facing their own fires. 
And then my son was born. 
In a time ... 
when hate crimes against our communities are at the highest they have been since 9/11. 
When white supremacists march in our streets, torches high, hoods off. 
And I have to reckon with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given. 
And there will be moments when I cannot protect him when he is seen as a terrorist ... 
just as black people in America are still seen as criminal. 
Brown people, illegal. 
Queer and trans people, immoral. 
Indigenous people, savage. 
Women and girls as property. 
I set down a candle in the spot where he bled to death. 
His brother, Rana, turned to me and said, "Nothing has changed." 
And I asked, "Who have we not yet tried to love?" 
We decided to call the murderer in prison. 
The phone rings. 
My heart is beating in my ears. 
I hear the voice of Frank Roque, a man who once said ... 
"I'm going to go out and shoot some towel heads. 
We should kill their children, too." 
And every emotional impulse in me says, "I can't." 
It becomes an act of will to wonder. 
"Why?" I ask. 
"Why did you agree to speak with us?" 
He fails to take responsibility. 
"Frank, this is the first time I'm hearing you say that you feel sorry." 
And Frank -- Frank says, "Yes. 
I am sorry for what I did to your brother. 
And I will hug him. 
And I will ask him for forgiveness." 
And Rana says ... 
"We already forgave you." 
Forgiveness is not forgetting. 
Forgiveness is freedom from hate. 
It cuts them off from their own capacity to love. 
This was my second lesson in revolutionary love. 
We love our opponents when we tend the wound in them. 
Tending to the wound is not healing them -- only they can do that. 
Just tending to it allows us to see our opponents: the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue. 
They've been radicalized by cultures and policies that we together can change. 
But when we chose to wield our swords and shields to battle bad systems, that's when we saw change. 
The choice to love our opponents is moral and pragmatic, and it opens up the previously unimaginable possibility of reconciliation. 
But remember ... 
it took 15 years to make that phone call. 
I had to tend to my own rage and grief first. 
Loving our opponents requires us to love ourselves. 
Gandhi, King, Mandela -- they taught a lot about how to love others and opponents. 
They didn't talk a lot about loving ourselves. 
This is a feminist intervention. 
Yes. 
But when we suppress our rage, that's when it hardens into hate directed outward, but usually directed inward. 
But mothering has taught me that all of our emotions are necessary. 
Joy is the gift of love. 
Grief is the price of love. 
Anger is the force that protects it. 
This was my third lesson in revolutionary love. 
That's why I believe that love must be practiced in all three directions to be revolutionary. 
Loving just ourselves feels good, but it's narcissism. 
Loving only others is ineffective. 
This is where a lot of our movements live right now. 
We need to practice all three forms of love. 
And so, how do we practice it? 
Ready? 
Number one ... 
in order to love others, see no stranger. 
And when we say this, what we are saying is, "You are a part of me I do not yet know. 
I choose to wonder about you. 
I will listen for your stories and pick up a sword when you are in harm's way." 
And so, number two: in order to love our opponents, tend the wound. 
Can you see the wound in the ones who hurt you? 
Can you wonder even about them? 
Number three: in order to love ourselves, breathe and push. 
How are you breathing each day? 
Who are you breathing with? 
Because ... 
when executive orders and news of violence hits our bodies hard, sometimes less than a minute apart, it feels like dying. 
In those moments, my son places his hand on my cheek and says, "Dance time, mommy?" 
And we dance. 
In the darkness, we breathe and we dance. 
Our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love. 
Our joy is an act of moral resistance. 
How are you protecting your joy each day? 
Because in joy we see even darkness with new eyes. 
What if our future is not dead, but still waiting to be born? 
What if this is our great transition? 
Remember the wisdom of the midwife. 
"Breathe," she says. 
And then -- "push." 
Because if we don't push, we will die. 
If we don't breathe, we will die. 
one day you will see my son as your own and protect him when I am not there. 
You will tend to the wound in the ones who want to hurt him. 
You will teach him how to love himself because you love yourself. 
You will whisper in his ear, as I whisper in yours, "You are brave." 
You are brave. 
Thank you. 
Every presentation needs this slide in it. 
Do you see? 
All the points, all the lines -- it's incredible. 
Isn't it amazing? 
Through that, I connect to people. 
And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted. 
For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners. 
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online. 
Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example. 
In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult. 
Poignant. 
This was a Mother's Day gift. 
But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people. 
This is project called Ray. 
And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio. 
Somebody said, "You have to listen to this." 
And this is what came to me. 
Here's how the song goes. 
And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job. 
All right. Stay strong. Peace. 
Ze Frank: So -- yeah. 
No, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly. 
So I was so moved by this -- this is incredible. This was connecting, right. 
This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do. 
So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him. 
And I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio. 
We have to remix it. He's got a great voice. 
It's actually in the key of B flat. 
And have to do something with it." 
Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts. 
One stood out in particular. 
It was done by a guy named Goose. 
So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. 
In the end, it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. 
And so I said, "Let's put this together in an album." 
And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover. 
In two weeks, they found him. 
I received and email and it said, "Hi, I'm Ray. 
I heard you were looking for me." 
It's been an interesting two weeks." 
And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world. 
But the truth is life is being lived there. 
And this is it, right, to feel and be felt. 
It's the fundamental force that we're all after. 
And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces. 
It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces, and we have to get better at figuring that out. 
This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade. 
Sometimes they're very, very simple things. 
And I collected those moments -- the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories, specifically. 
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. 
He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow. 
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it. 
Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract. 
And people called in and left messages like this. 
Recording: Okay, here's something. 
I'm not alone, and I am loved. 
I'm really fortunate. 
But sometimes I feel really lonely. 
And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. 
Like even people in convenience stores saying, "Have a nice day," when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. 
And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material. 
You can look at it online. 
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try. 
Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation." 
And so some really nice things came together. 
"I voted blue. I voted red. 
Together, for our future." 
These are very, very cute little things right. 
Some came from the winning party. 
"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always." 
Some came from the party who had just lost. 
"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you, but I doubt it." 
And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail, death threats even. 
And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages, and he was dressed as Batman. 
And he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity." 
And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. 
It's amazing. 
So one of them was fairly straightforward. 
So I was like, "Awesome. This is great." 
And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this. 
And I don't have much time. 
So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me. 
And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour. 
And I shut that part down. 
One person sent me a very detailed description; the other person didn't. 
So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?" 
I was like, "I don't know. 
Didn't know I had one." 
But anyway, this same person, Laura, ended up emailing me a little bit after that project. 
And I felt badly for not having done a good job. 
So I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?" 
And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety. 
And so what I decided to do. 
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it." 
And so quietly in the background, I started sending people this. 
And this is the kind of thing that I got back. 
And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me. 
I just want to say thanks for even considering it." 
And then a few days later I sent her this. 
The stories we tell about each other matter very much. 
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter. 
And most of all, I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance. 
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor. 
I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material -- food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have. 
This is what Jesus asked of us. 
And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me." 
Now I was pretty psyched. 
I was very eager to be useful in the world -- I think we all have that feeling. 
And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help. 
That was news to me, and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in. 
But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing, the poor would always be with us. 
So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry, like maybe I'd misunderstood something here. 
And I felt overwhelmed. 
And for the first time, I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people. 
I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away, that would always be with us. 
In the years following, the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive. 
For example, I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering. 
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor. 
I heard about disease, I heard about war -- they always seemed to be kind of related. 
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that. 
And so naturally, I started to distance myself. 
I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before. 
And I stopped expecting things to really change. 
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved. 
I gave of my time and my money, I gave when solutions were on sale. 
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right. 
I mean who can argue with that? 
It became a transaction for me, became sort of a trade. 
And it can also turn into a commodity, which is a very scary thing. 
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most. 
It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and, in short to love. 
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus. 
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that. 
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well -- think of that as financial services for the poor. 
Dr. Yunus shared his story, explaining what that was, and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. 
He also talked about, in particular, microlending, which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business. 
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons. 
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note. 
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital. 
It was an amazing sort of insight for me. 
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories. 
So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats. 
Their business trajectory would change. 
They would make a little bit more money; their standard of living would shift and would get better. 
They might be able to buy mosquito nets. 
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. 
That was another thing that really touched me. 
So I saw that and it was very humbling. 
Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there. 
I never once was asked for a donation, which had kind of been my mode, right. 
There's poverty, you give money to help -- no one asked me for a donation. 
In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all. 
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. 
I just got this impression that the money would work. 
And my introduction to business was in these $100 little infuses of capital. 
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things, from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders. 
The money came in basically overnight. 
We sent it over to Uganda. 
In October of '05, after those first seven loans were paid, Matt and I took the word beta off of the site. 
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success. 
Let's start for real." That was our official launch. 
And then that first year, October '05 through '06, Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans. 
The second year, it was a total of 15 million. 
The third year, the total was up to around 40. 
The fourth year, we were just short of 100. 
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present. 
And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting, to me, Kiva's really about stories. 
But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward. 
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines. 
Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done. 
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other. 
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning. 
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me. 
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years, have taught me what entrepreneurship is. 
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better. 
You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that. 
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that. 
Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity. 
So they're not a donation. 
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different. 
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention -- is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us. 
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination. 
So with that in mind, this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now. 
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this. 
And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world. 
As I've researched what's going on in the United States, a few interesting little insights have come up. 
But there's always a need for resources close by. 
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family. 
That's around 130 billion dollars a year -- it's a lot. 
And it's investments, not donations, not loans, but investments that have a dynamic return. 
So the mapping of participating in the story, it actually flows with the up and down. 
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. 
And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile, create investment terms in a really easy way. 
We make it really, really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. 
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. 
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor. 
So that's what I'm working on now. 
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools. 
And I think I can remind us that we do care. 
I think we all already know that. 
And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try. 
Just a sec. 
And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED. 
And that -- forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources -- that stuff's easy. 
Thank you. 
This technology made a very important impact on us. 
It changed the way our history developed. 
But we see the results of this technology, still. 
So let's make a little test. 
So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please. 
Turn and face your neighbors. 
Please, also on the balcony. 
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths. 
Smile, friendly. 
Of course not. 
Sounds like fast food, doesn't it. 
We carry in our face the proof that cooking, food transformation, made us what we are. 
So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. 
We are the animals who eat cooked food. 
No, no, no, no. Better -- to live of cooked food. 
So cooking is a very important technology. 
It's technology. 
I don't know how you feel, but I like to cook for entertainment. 
And you need some design to be successful. 
Because brains are expensive. 
Those have to pay tuition fees know. 
You now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass, but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use. 
It's very expensive. 
Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food. 
If we eat raw food, we cannot release really the energy. 
So this ingenuity of our ancestors, to invent this most marvelous technology. 
Invisible -- everyone of us does it every day, so to speak. 
Cooking made it possible that mutations, natural selections, our environment, could develop us. 
So if we think about this unleashing human potential, which was possible by cooking and food, why do we talk so badly about food? 
Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you, it's not good for you? 
Now, cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. 
We walked out of Africa two times. 
We populated all the ecologies. 
If you can cook, nothing can happen to you, because whatever you find, you will try to transform it. 
It keeps also your brain working. 
Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. 
Take something which looks like food, transform it, and it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy. 
This technology affected two organs, the brain and the gut, which it actually affected. 
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk. 
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest. 
So because of having cooked food, it's easier to digest. 
Now having a large brain, as you know, is a big advantage, because you can actually influence your environment. 
You can influence your own technologies you have invented. 
You can continue to innovate and invent. 
Now the big brain did this also with cooking. 
But how did it actually run this show? 
How did it actually interfere? 
What kind of criteria did it use? 
And this is actually taste reward and energy. 
You know we have up to five tastes, three of them sustain us. 
Sweet -- energy. 
Umami -- this is a meaty taste. 
You need proteins for muscles, recovery. 
Salty, because you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work. 
And two tastes which protect you -- bitter and sour, which are against poisonous and rotten material. 
But of course, they are hard-wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way. 
Think about bittersweet chocolate; or think about the acidity of yogurt -- wonderful -- mixed with strawberry fruits. 
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that, in cooking, we can transform it to the form. 
And something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat. 
So satisfaction was a very important part. 
And as I say, energy was necessary. 
Now how did the gut actually participate in this development? 
And the gut is a silent voice -- it's going more for feelings. 
I use the euphemism digestive comfort -- actually -- it's a digestive discomfort, which the gut is concerned with. 
If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated, was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong. 
So my story is a tale of two brains, because it might surprise you, our gut has a full-fledged brain. 
All the managers in the room say, "You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling. 
This is what we are using." 
Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system, they do speak with each other and make decisions. 
Now if there's a gut brain, we should also learn to talk with this brain. 
Now 150 years ago, anatomists described very, very carefully -- here is a model of a wall of a gut. 
I took the three elements -- stomach, small intestine and colon. 
And within this structure, you see these two pinkish layers, which are actually the muscle. 
The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body. 
It penetrates the mucosa. 
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest, which is actually the lumen. 
If we could unroll it, get out all the folds and so on, it would have 400 sq. meters of surface. 
And now this brain takes care over this, to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and, of course, digest our food we cook. 
It has 20 different neuron types. 
It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons. 
It has autonomous organized microcircuits, has these programs which run. 
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do. 
This control of muscle is very, very important, because, you know, there can be reflexes. 
If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag. 
It's this brain which makes this reflex. 
And then finally, it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery, which actually digests the food we cook. 
Now how do the two brains work with each other? 
I took here a model from robotics -- it's called the Subsumption Architecture. 
What it means is that we have a layered control system. 
Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows -- both look to the same food, which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine. 
It can replace, or it can inhibit actually, signals. 
So if we take two types of signals -- a hunger signal for example. 
If you have an empty stomach, your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin. 
It's a very big signal; it's sent to the brain says, "Go and eat." 
You have stop signals -- we have up to eight stop signals. 
At least in my case, they are not listened to. 
Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. 
The more usual case is overeating. 
It actually takes the signal and changes it, and we continue, even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough. 
We have transferred enough energy." 
This we found from bariatric surgery. 
That then the signal would be very, very high. 
So now back to the cooking question and back to the design. 
We have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward, as you know. 
Then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the satiation. 
Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim. 
This is fat digestion. 
You have on your left an olive oil droplet, and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes. 
This is an in vitro experiment. 
It's very difficult to work in the intestine. 
Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens, when the constituents are liberated, they disappear, they go away because they [were] absorbed. 
Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. 
And I hope you can see that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image, which is water. 
And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat. 
How can we cook that we have this language developed? 
So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma. 
So I would say, coquo ergo sum: I cook, therefore I am. 
Thank you very much. 
I'm a visual artist, and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. 
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations. 
And I thought, "Great. 
It's ephemeral just like us." 
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing. 
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic. 
And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment. 
I then, in the last few years, learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. 
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up." 
And the bigger picture is: we need to find a way to turn off the faucet. 
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. 
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry. 
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. 
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic. 
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market. 
We have many initiatives that we're working on, but some of them are very basic. 
It's plastic pollution. 
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling. 
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again. 
What is the reality of that? 
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled. 
So this is a big issue for us. 
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics. 
Alternatives exist; some of them are very old-school. 
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in. 
And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family. 
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. 
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives to single-use plastics. 
So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist -- political cartoonist. 
I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers? 
It's a sort of paper-based reader. 
You know what they say? 
They say the print media is dying -- who says that? Well, the media. 
But this is no news, right? 
You've read about it already. 
I know it's a cliche, but look, look how small, how tiny it has gotten. 
And you know the reason why, of course. 
This is because of technology -- yeah. 
Yeah well, you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round, a nice round shape. 
That makes a good cartoon. 
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad, those square things? 
There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist. 
Well, I know the world is flat now. 
That's true. 
And the Internet has reached every corner of the world, the poorest, the remotest places. 
Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe. 
So we are bridging the digital divide. 
The Third World is connected, we are connected. 
And what happens next? 
Well, you've got mail. 
Yeah. 
Well, the Internet has empowered us. 
And they were not used to that in communist 2.0 Vietnam. 
He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches, and I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan." 
And as he came the second day, I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover." 
And on the third day, I finally understood, the guy was actually on duty. 
So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police. 
It has rocked the music industry; it has changed the way we consume music. 
For those of you old enough to remember, we used to have to go to the store to steal it. 
So be careful with that Facebook account -- your momma told you, be careful. 
And technology has set us free -- this is free WiFi. 
But yeah, it has liberated us from the office desk. 
This is your life, enjoy it. 
They are shaping the way we consume. 
They are shaping our very desires. 
And technology has even changed our relationship to God. 
This was so sickening; people died because of cartoons. 
I mean -- I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually. 
They were used first by a Danish newspaper, which wanted to make a point on Islam. 
He told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw. 
This is not how it works." 
And then, of course, they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side. 
They wanted to stir up controversy. 
You know the story. 
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons. 
History tells us, they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews. 
And here we are now. 
So the clash of civilizations is here, and cartoons are at the middle of it? 
This got me thinking. 
Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two. 
This looks like a giant hamburger. 
You don't want to be the ham in the middle. 
I was there to report on that story in cartoons. 
I've been doing this for the last 15 years; it's my side job, if you want. 
So you see the style is different. 
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning. 
I went to places like Gaza during the war in 2009. 
So this is really journalism in cartoons. 
You'll hear more and more about it. 
This is the future of journalism, I think. 
And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north. 
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights. 
There was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa. 
And I went to see the Dozo. 
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters of West Africa. 
People fear them -- they help the rebellion a lot. 
They are believed to have magical powers. 
They can disappear and escape bullets. 
I went to see a Dozo chief; he told me about his magical powers. 
He said, "I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life." 
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now." 
And what can a cartoonist do? 
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see, and the guy has to feed his family, right? 
So the idea was pretty simple. 
We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. 
We took them away from their newspaper for three days. 
Show the positive power of cartoons. 
It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good. 
And cartoons can cross boundaries, as you have seen. 
And humor is a good way, I think, to address serious issues. 
And I'm very proud of what they did. 
I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point. 
And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons. 
The first day, they were even shouting at each other. 
So the idea was there. 
And I've been doing projects like this, in 2009 in Lebanon, this year in Kenya, back in January. 
In Lebanon, it was not a book. 
The idea was to have -- the same principal, a divided country -- take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together. 
And it worked. 
So this was a great project. 
And we did video clips -- you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons. 
He has to keep his job. 
And that's the message I try to convey to them. 
I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. 
But we need to support these independent, critical and responsible voices in Africa, in Lebanon, in your local newspaper, in the Apple store. 
Today, tech companies are the world's largest editors. 
They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. 
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists; it's about your freedoms. 
And for dictators all over the world, the good news is when cartoonists, journalists and activists shut up. 
Thank you. 
Okay. 
The big residual is always value for money. 
All the time we are trying to get value for money. 
What we don't look for is value for many, while we are generating value for money. 
Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day, the so-called bottom of the pyramid? 
What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many? 
We have described here in terms of the performance and the price. 
If you have money, of course, you can get the value. 
You can get a Mercedes for a very high price, very high performance. 
But if you don't have money, what happens? 
Well, poor do not remain poor; they become lower-middle-class. 
And if they do so, then, of course, the conditions improve, and they start riding on scooters. 
But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value, because they can't afford anything more than the scooter. 
The issue is, at that price, can you give them some extra value? 
Now, this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time. 
But many people see the same thing and think things differently, and one of them is here, Ratan Tata. 
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done. 
They believe that things can be done. 
But great leaders like Ratan have compassion. 
Let me confirm what she said. 
Yes, I went barefoot until I was 12. 
I struggled to [unclear] day was a huge issue. 
And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard, I stood eleventh among 125,000 students. 
But I was about to leave the school, because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling. 
That's how I'm standing before you. 
So that is the House of Tata. 
They combine all that. 
Of course, as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible, and that's what was said by Suzuki. 
He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler with stepney. 
And you can see the cartoon here. 
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. 
And incredible car. 
We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment." 
How did this great story unfold, the making of Nano? 
Let me tell you a bit about it. 
For example, how we started: Ratan just began with a five-engineer team, young people in their mid-twenties. 
And he said, "Well, I won't define the vehicle for you, but I will define the cost for you. 
It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees, and you are to make it within that." 
And he told them, "Question the unquestionable. 
Stretch the envelope." 
And at a point in time, he got so engrossed in the whole challenge, that he himself became a member of the team. 
Can you believe it? 
I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated. 
Until midnight, he'd be thinking. 
Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions. 
But who was the team leader? 
The team leader was Girish Wagh, a 34 year-old boy in [unclear]. 
And the Nano team average age was just 27 years. 
And they did innovation in design and beyond. 
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time. 
For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft. 
Adhesives were replacing the rivets. 
There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation, with vendors and suppliers. 
All ideas on board were welcome. 
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant, and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed. 
Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano. 
I mean, it was incredible innovation. 
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors. 
It was an open innovation, ideas from all over were welcome. 
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way, as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two-wheelers. 
The fuel lines and lamps were as in two-wheelers. 
And the crux of the matter was, however, getting more from less. 
All the time, you have been given an envelope. 
You can't cross that envelope, which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars. 
And therefore, each component had to have a dual functionality. 
And the seat riser, for example, serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. 
Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car. 
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way. 
But the current entry-level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less, but 21 percent more inside space. 
And what happened was that -- more from less -- you can see how much more for how much less. 
Volkswagon was 11,333. 
And British Motor was around 11,000. 
And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars. 
And those dreams are getting fulfilled. 
This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home. 
The driver's name is Naran. 
He has bought his own Nano. 
And that's why I call it a transformational innovation. 
It is not just technological, it is social innovation that we talk about. 
And that is where, ladies and gentlemen, this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important. 
And unbelievably, in 40 years, I was the first Indian to be honored. 
And the title of my talk was therefore "Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering." 
And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering. 
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. 
Here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot. 
What is its price? 20,000 dollars. 
And of course, these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads. 
Unfortunately, that's not the case in India. 
You can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land, and so on and so forth. 
And they climb up for their work. 
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions. 
A challenge, of course. 
Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day. 
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe, you're talking about 10,000 days of income. 
You just don't have it. 
And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives. 
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India. 
It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system, a quick molding and modular components, enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments. 
You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way, whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day, as so on. 
Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes, rather than using heated sheets. 
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks, [unclear] and functions. 
And I like to show how it looks and how it works. 
(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this. 
... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ... 
"Did it hurt?" 
"No ... not at all." 
... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...) One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds. 
And therefore Time took notice of this 28-dollar foot, basically. 
Let's move on to something else. 
I've been talking about getting more from less for more. 
Let's move to health. 
We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health. 
What's happening in the area of health? 
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs. 
And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now, what has happened? 
10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion. 
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars. 
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money? 
No, I'm sorry. 
We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30. 
So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people. 
Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive, so very few will be able to basically afford that. 
Let us just take an example. 
Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin. 
The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars. 
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way, and 20 of them. 
Time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars. 
Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. 
For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it. 
Can we do it [for] 100 dollars? 
Time for development, not 10 years. 
We are in a hurry. Five years. 
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars. 
Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars. 
Looks absolutely audacious. 
Looks absolutely ridiculous. 
You know something? This has been achieved in India. 
These targets have been achieved in India. 
And how they have been achieved ... 
And that is how this difference has come. 
And you can see this blending of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science. 
He is giving us not just for Psoriasis, for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm. 
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of [unclear] by doing things differently. 
You can see before treatment and after treatment. 
This is really getting more from less for more and more people, because these are all affordable treatments now. 
Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. 
He had said, "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed." 
And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all." 
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people, not just a few people. 
And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this is the theme, getting more from less for more. 
And mind you, it is not getting just a little more for just a little less. 
It's not about low cost. 
It's about ultra-low cost. 
You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars, but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000. 
Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars. 
Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way, for certain other different reasons. 
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost. 
You are not talking about affordability, you are talking about extreme affordability. 
Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day. 
You're not talking exclusive innovation. 
You're talking about inclusive innovation. 
And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation, you're talking about disruptive innovation. 
The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms. 
I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day. 
You know, incubators for infants, for example. 
They're not available in Africa. 
They're not available in Indian villages. 
And infants die. 
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars. 
And there's a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. 
And by whom? 
By young students from Standford University on an extreme affordability project that they had, basically. 
Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata. 
It's not just innovation, compassion and passion -- compassion in the heart and passion in the belly. 
That's the new world that we want to create. 
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time. 
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes. 
I've still one and a half to go. 
The message, the final message, is this: India gave a great gift to the world. 
What was that? 
[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world. 
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering. 
So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce, this gift of the 21st century to the world from India, Gandhian engineering. 
Now, when you were a young boy in this school, what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become? 
What do you think that drove you? 
Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you? 
RAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life. 
It was [unclear] high school. 
But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly. 
And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics. 
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down. 
And there was a bright spot up there. 
But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi. 
And then the paper burned. 
That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve. 
I said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful, I have to become a scientist." 
But more importantly, focus and you can achieve. 
And that message, very frankly, is valuable for society today. 
What does that focal length do? 
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays. 
And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. 
What does that convex lens do? 
It makes them meet. 
This is convex lens leadership. 
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length. 
So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that. 
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear]. 
And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance, 60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S. 
I'm trying to build a global team, which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing. 
That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment. 
I'm going to talk to you about power in this 21st century. 
And basically, what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing, and there are two types of changes I want to discuss. 
One is power transition, which is change of power amongst states. 
And there the simple version of the message is it's moving from West to East. 
Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. 
When we talk about power transition, we often talk about the rise of Asia. 
It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia. 
That's important and it's an important shift. 
But let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that I'm talking about, which is power diffusion. 
Now that's a big abstract number. 
Now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically, the barriers to entry go down. 
Anybody can play in the game. 
So in 1970, if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously, you could do it. 
The technology was there. 
Now, anybody has that capacity, which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors. 
So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone. 
And what that means is not that the age of the State is over. 
The State still matters. 
But the stage is crowded. 
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors. 
Some of that's good: Oxfam, a great non-governmental actor. 
Some of it's bad: Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor. 
But think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts. 
We think in terms of war and interstate war. 
And you can think back to 1941 when the government of Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. 
It's worth noticing that a non-state actor attacking the United States in 2001 killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in 1941. 
You might think of that as the privatization of war. 
So we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power. 
Now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways. 
So let me step back and ask: what's power? 
And that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood, and yet it's tremendously important. 
Indeed, if you can learn to use more soft power, you can save a lot on carrots and sticks. 
Traditionally, the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power. 
But we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the 21st century. 
It's not just prevailing at war, though war still persists. 
It's not whose army wins; it's also whose story wins. 
And we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective. 
Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there. 
the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers. 
And the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States. 
Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis, many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power. 
The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting. 
And president Medvedev of Russia, for example, pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of United States power. 
But in fact, this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. 
In 1958, after the Soviets put up Sputnik, it was "That's the end of America." 
In 1973, with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window, that was the end of America. 
But in fact, what we've seen is none of those were true. 
Goldman Sachs has projected that China, the Chinese economy, will surpass that of the U.S. 
by 2027. 
So we've got, what, 17 more years to go or so before China's bigger. 
Now someday, with a billion point three people getting richer, they are going to be bigger than the United States. 
Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple. 
First of all, it's a linear projection. 
You know, everything says, here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S., here it goes -- straight line. 
History is not linear. 
There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way. 
China still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy. 
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part, after 2050, of this century. 
The other point that's worth noticing is how one-dimensional this projection is. 
You know, it looks at economic power measured by GDP. 
Doesn't tell you much about military power, doesn't tell you very much about soft power. 
It's all very one-dimensional. 
It's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States, which they're not. 
So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition. 
But you might ask, well so what in any case? 
Why does it matter? Who cares? 
Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play? 
The answer is it matters quite a lot. 
Let me give you an example from history. 
What caused it? 
Notice both halves of that explanation. 
No, I think that's wrong. 
It's bad history. 
For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial strength by 1900. 
And as I said earlier, China has not passed the United States. 
But also, if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear, it leads to overreaction. 
And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear. 
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context, the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. 
We don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia. 
Top board: military power among states. 
The United States is the only superpower, and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. 
China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board. 
Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game: economic power among states. 
Power is multi-polar. 
There are balancers -- the U.S., Europe, China, Japan can balance each other. 
It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi-polar. 
Power is chaotically distributed. 
Power can also be positive sum, where your gain can be my gain. 
It's one in which we can all gain. 
Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this. 
Wars persist. Power persists. 
Military power is important. 
Keeping balances is important. 
All this still persists. 
Hard power is there, and it will remain. 
How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum, but positive sum. 
And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that. 
How do we produce global public goods, which are good for us, but good for everyone at the same time? 
And that's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century. 
And that's the good news I have. We can do that. 
Thank you very much. 
Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught. 
The who and the why are what's important to me. 
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices. 
I want to know how I impact them. 
I want to know how they impact me. 
I want to know why they fish. 
I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. 
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. 
So what do we call this? 
I think we call it restorative seafood. 
Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. 
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human, and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. 
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species. 
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red, think twice about yellow. 
But in my mind, it's really not enough to just eat green list. 
But what if we eat only in the green list? 
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here -- comes from sustainable stocks. 
Pole caught -- no bycatch. 
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. 
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator. 
What's the context of this meal? 
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this? 
Do I do this three times a week? 
The point is that we have to have a context, a gauge for our actions in all this. 
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health -- antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy. 
That's great! I love red wine! 
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy. 
Well, how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem? 
Well folks, we have a protein problem. 
We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food, and we are paying a cost. 
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves. 
We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. 
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. 
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs. 
Vegetables: they might yet save the oceans. 
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. 
Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. 
We must continue to eat the best seafood possible, if at all. 
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables. 
Whooo! 
This is an easy sell. 
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. 
Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat. 
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat. 
There's a pattern here. 
Forget nuclear holocaust; it's the fork that we have to worry about. 
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong. 
And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food. 
Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand. 
So let's start there. 
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. 
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution. 
But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters. 
We have eco-friendly shrimp. 
We can make them; we have that technology. 
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet. 
It doesn't work. 
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood. 
While we try to manage declining marine populations, the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood. 
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up. 
But it's not all about the seafood. 
It's about the way that we look at our plates. 
A couple things happened. 
I made more money. 
People spent more time engaging in their meals, engaging with each other over their meals. 
People got, in short, more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. 
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal. 
They got healthier. I made more money. 
This is great. 
Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. 
Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species. 
We were directing tastes towards more resilience, more restorative options. 
This is what we need to favor. 
This is what the green list says. 
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. 
But what of those big predators, those fashionable species, that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier? 
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you. 
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean, so here we go. 
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish. 
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions. 
Put it on four plates. 
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this. 
Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year, maybe. 
I expect a lot from food. 
I expect health and joy and family and community. 
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. 
And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents. 
I remember well the meals of my childhood. 
They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch, usually rice. 
This is still how I largely eat today. 
I get sick when I go to steakhouses. 
I get the meat sweats. 
It's like a hangover from protein. 
It's disgusting. 
Eat your vegetables. 
It's pretty straightforward. 
So what are we looking for in a meal? 
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. 
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance. 
For family, I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories. 
For community though, we start at the very beginning. 
There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact. 
We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank. 
We need to savor vegetables. 
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood. 
And we need to save dinner. 
Thank you. 
I'm a scientist, and I'm a big fan of Star Trek, especially of Mr. Spock. 
And also the fans of Star Trek watch with amusement this seemingly contradictory behavior. 
They find it quite fascinating. 
And the matter is a golden thread through the whole Star Trek series and movies from the '60s until today. 
And that's actually what I want to talk about today: the role of emotions in science. 
I would like to suggest that emotions are as important in science as they are in any other part of our lives. 
Science is made by humans, and as human beings, even if we try hard, we cannot get rid of our emotions. 
I'm working in research on organic light-emitting diodes, so-called OLEDs. 
This is how you might know them, as new generation of displays. 
OLEDs are more and more used in smartphone displays and TV screens. 
They make them appear bright, truly colorful and bendable. 
This is how they look like in the research lab of my physicist colleagues. 
And this is what I, as a chemist, have in mind when I think about them. 
I've loved it ever since I started to work on it. 
At the time, the management had reasons for this decision, and the company handled it very well, actually. 
Nobody lost their jobs, and everybody was rewarded for their performed work. 
Consider it a small case study on emotions in science. 
Here's what happened. 
Even though we knew that we were working on a project that was to be stopped, during those months our output hit the roof. 
And the results I show you here concern the green OLED project. 
Nevertheless, from this time on, our results continued to improve rapidly. 
How did that happen? 
What I mean is, while the number of scientists working on the project was decreasing, the dedication of people remaining grew dramatically. 
And also, a new and more intense team spirit formed. 
We felt that we belonged to something bigger. 
And furthermore, our project was less and less in the focus of the management, because they started to think about new projects, restructuring and so on. 
This resulted in additional freedom and the possibility to take a few things into our own hands. 
Of course, more freedom also means more responsibility, which we were happy to take, because we believed in our work. 
We felt empowered. 
So we were working with such personal engagement on a project already sentenced to death because we felt connected to something meaningful. 
So overall, we had a very intense and mesmerizingly exciting time. 
And those results helped our employer to sell the patents for real value. 
Now, let me tell you the same story with different characters and a slightly different operation. 
The story is part of Star Trek. 
And sorry for those of you who haven't seen the movies, but I need to introduce a spoiler here. 
And after dealing with great challenges, they eventually found Spock, and he happily and gratefully joined the team again. 
He could feel the dedication and the connection of his team towards their project, which was to save him and to hold the crew together. 
The main characters are all part of a great team. 
All team members show a huge dedication towards reaching their goal. 
They strive to seize all the freedom they can get, and they take the responsibility they need to take. 
During the time our OLED project was nearing the end, I received one piece of advice several times. 
"Don't take it to your heart. 
You can work on something else." 
And as the same is true for my colleagues and our whole project, we would have achieved far less. 
So of course, science should be based on facts and logic. 
When I say we should use our emotions in science, I do not suggest we should use feelings instead of facts. 
Emotions and logic do not oppose each other. 
They complement each other, and they reinforce each other. 
Thank you. 
I'm a bug lover, myself -- not from childhood, by the way, but rather late. 
When I bachelored, majoring in zoology at Tel Aviv University, I kind of fell in love with bugs. 
And then, within zoology, I took the course or the discipline of entomology, the science of insects. 
And then I thought to myself, how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology? 
And then I moved to the world of plant protection -- plant protection from insects, from bad bugs. 
So it's a whole discipline in plant protection aimed at the reduction of chemicals. 
And biological pest control, by the way, or these "good bugs" that we are talking about, they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years, for a long, long time. 
Because biological control phenomenon -- you can see it in your backyard. 
Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here? 
That's a magnifier, times 10. 
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere. 
Here, in front of this building, I'm sure. 
Just have a look at the plants. 
So it's everywhere, and we need to know how to exploit it. 
Well, let's go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. 
What is a pest? 
What damage does it actually inflict on the plant? 
In general, I'm going to talk about insects and spiders, or mites, let us call them. 
Insects, those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites, the eight-legged organisms. 
Let's have a look at that. 
Here is a devastating pest, a spider mite, because it does a lot of webbing, like a spider. 
You see the mother in between, and two daughters, probably, on the left and right, and a single egg on the right-hand side. 
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict. 
On your right-hand side, you can see a cucumber leaf, in the middle, a cotton leaf, and on the left, a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. 
They can literally turn from green to white, because of the sucking, piercing mouth parts of those spiders. 
By the way, a meal for them for 24 hours, is about five of the spider mites, of the bad mites, and-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites. 
By the way, they are always hungry. 
It's springtime now in Israel. 
When temperatures rise sharply, you can see those bad ones, those aphids, all over the plants -- in your hibiscus, in your lantana, in the young, fresh foliage of the so-called spring flush. 
By the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons. 
Females giving rise to females, giving rise to other females. 
No males at all. 
And they're very happy with that, apparently. 
Those aphids secrete a sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew, and this just clogs the upper parts of the plant. 
And here comes the salvation, through this parasitic wasp. 
Here we are not talking about a predator. 
Here we are talking a parasite -- not a two-legged parasite, but an eight-legged parasite, of course. 
This is a parasitic wasp, again, two millimeters long, slender, a very quick and sharp flier. 
And here you can see this parasite in action, like in an acrobatic maneuver. 
By the way, the aphid tries to escape. 
Again -- in your backyard. In your backyard. 
The birth is almost complete. 
You can see, by the way, in different movies, etc., it takes just a few minutes. 
And if this is a female, she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes, because time is very short. 
This female can live only three to four days, and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs. 
That means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids. 
This is, of course, not the end of it. 
There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example. 
Again, we'll start first with the pest: the thrips. 
By the way, all these weird names -- I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures, just the popular names. 
But this is a nice, slender, very bad pest. 
This is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper. 
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults. 
Here you can see the adult, black, and two young ones. 
And again, in action. 
And if we spread those minute pirate bugs, the good ones, for example, in a sweet pepper plot, they go to the flowers. 
And look -- this flower is flooded with predatory bugs, with the good ones, after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips. 
So this is a very positive situation. 
No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set. 
Everything is just fine under these circumstances. 
But again, the question is, here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest, the natural enemy. 
What we do is actually this. 
In Northeast Israel, in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, there is a facility that mass-produces those natural enemies. 
In other words, what we do there is amplify the natural control, or the biological control phenomenon. 
And in 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses, there, we are mass-producing those predatory mites, those minute pirate bugs, those parasitic wasps, etc. 
Many different parts. 
And by the way, mass-production -- it is not genetic manipulation. 
There are no GMOs -- genetically modified organisms -- whatsoever. 
And that's what we get. 
You see under a microscope. 
You see in the upper left corner? You see a single predatory mite. 
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites. 
You see this ampul. You see this one. 
I have one gram of those predatory mites. 
One gram is 80,000 individuals. 
And we can produce from this, believe you me, several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis. 
So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon. 
And no, we do not disrupt the balance. 
On the contrary, because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals. 
And what is the impact? 
In this table, you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs. 
And Israeli strawberries, even more -- 80 percent of the pesticides, especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries. 
So the impact is very strong. 
And there goes the question, especially if you ask growers, agriculturists: Why biological control? 
Why good bugs? 
By the way, the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask. 
So safety, with respect to the application, is the number one answer that we get from growers, for "Why biological control?" 
It's the same, and it can happen very quickly. 
Fortunately, in either biological control or even natural control, resistance is extremely rare. 
It hardly happens. 
Because this is evolution, this is the natural ratio, unlike resistance, which happens in the case of chemicals. 
And thirdly, public demand. 
Finally, I want to get to my vision, or, in fact, to my dream. 
Because, you see, this is the reality. 
Have a look at the gap. 
If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide, it's 250 million dollars. 
And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world. 
I think it's times 100 or something like that. 
Twenty-five billion. 
So there is a huge gap to bridge. 
So actually, how can we do it? 
How can we bridge, or let's say, narrow, this gap over the years? 
Secondly, to create even more intensive and strict public demand for the reduction of chemicals in agricultural fresh produce. 
And thirdly, also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry. 
And this gap really narrows. 
Step by step, it does narrow. 
So I think my last slide is: All we are saying -- we can actually sing it -- Give nature a chance. 
Thank you. 
Miwa Matreyek! 
I love video games. 
I'm also slightly in awe of them. 
I'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination, in terms of technology, in terms of concept. 
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this. 
And in particular, I think we can learn things about learning. 
Now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media. 
In four years' time, it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars. 
That's about three times the recorded music industry. 
This is pretty stunning, but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all. 
This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe. 
Earlier this year, a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330,000 real dollars. 
And this is a Titan class ship in the space game, EVE Online. 
And yet, many of these get built. 
This may all sound really quite alarming to some people, an index of something worrying or wrong in society. 
And by answering that question, I think we can take something extremely powerful away. 
And I think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards. 
On the one hand, there's the wanting processes. 
This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard. 
It's a really great image. It's pretty cool. 
Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome. 
It gives you great powers. 
Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful. 
It's a very great pleasure to fly around. 
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement. 
But this isn't the really interesting stuff. 
The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it. 
Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything. 
Every single thing that every single person who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured. 
And this allows something very special to happen in games. 
It's something called the reward schedule. 
Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item. 
Simple game quest. 
Now you can think about this, if you like, as a problem about boxes. 
I've got to keep opening boxes. 
I don't know what's inside them until I open them. 
And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies. 
Now, if you take a game like Warcraft, you can think about it, if you like, as a great box-opening effort. 
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes, getting better and better stuff in them. 
This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling. 
And the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data. 
Let's think about probability. 
It keeps people engaged. 
But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies. 
That would be very boring. 
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number. 
You find that -- you know, between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going. 
But we don't just have pies in the boxes. 
There's 100 percent up here. 
In most adventure games, it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience. 
But we don't just do that either. 
We also say there's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement. 
There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item. 
There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item. 
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item. 
And also, we say, "Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?" 
No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time. 
So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult. 
So all this is very powerful. 
But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes. 
So we can do some rather amazing things. 
They're not rational about probability. 
They think this game is unfair. 
It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up. 
If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do, but in a game we can just say, "Right, well. 
When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now." 
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do -- adjust the world to match their expectation. 
Our games don't always do this. 
But now, we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes. 
So what does all this mean in practice? 
It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places. 
And everything comes towards that, and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along. 
Second, multiple long and short-term aims -- 5,000 pies, boring, 15 pies, interesting. 
So, you give people lots and lots of different tasks. 
Third, you reward effort. 
It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this. 
Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying. 
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement. 
Fourth, feedback. 
This is absolutely crucial, and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this. 
Pollution, global warming, these things -- the consequences are distant in time and space. 
It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson. 
And fifth, the element of uncertainty. 
The 25 percent. This lights the brain up. 
When we don't quite predict something perfectly, we get really excited about it. 
We just want to go back and find out more. 
As you probably know, the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine. 
It's associated with reward-seeking behavior. 
And two things really flow from this. 
The first has to do with memory, that we can find these moments. 
When someone is more likely to remember, we can give them a nugget in a window. 
This can all seem very sinister. 
But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts." 
The word "addiction" is thrown around. 
There are real concerns there. 
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people is other people. 
This is what really excites us. 
And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 -- a video game called EverQuest. 
That's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items. 
What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency they called "dragon kill points." 
And every time you turned up to go on a mission, you got paid in dragon kill points. 
They tracked these on a separate website. 
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent. 
This is a player-developed, self-enforcing, voluntary currency, and it's incredibly sophisticated player behavior. 
And I just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world. 
Let's start with business. 
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. 
We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real-time energy meters. 
In terms of education, perhaps most obviously of all, we can transform how we engage people. 
We can offer people the grand continuity of experience and personal investment. 
We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks. 
We can use calculated randomness. 
We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together. 
And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together, these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms. 
So we're seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity. 
And in the end, it's this word, "engagement," that I want to leave you with. 
Thank you very much. 
So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does. 
We stand in elections; we vote in elections; we observe elections. 
Our democracies rely on elections. 
We all understand why we have elections, and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote. 
We cherish the opportunity to have our say, to help decide the future of the country. 
Without that mandate, they would be corrupt. 
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong, we have all these procedures around the election. 
Well, what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that, after you drop your vote into the ballot box. 
They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly. 
The ballot boxes go to counting places. 
They're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted. 
So we have to trust a lot of people. 
We have to trust a lot of procedures. 
And sometimes we even have to trust computers. 
Well in the face of all these bad headlines, researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. 
They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture. 
And the big picture is this: elections should be verifiable. 
And that's the tough part. 
How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret? 
Well, the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. 
And the secret is the ballot form. 
And if you look closely at these ballot forms, you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one. 
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right. 
And there's some complicated cryptography going on in there, but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms. 
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us, and then we'll use the paper for verification. 
So this is how you vote. 
And you shred the candidate list. 
And the bit that remains, the one with your marks -- this is your encrypted vote. 
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote. 
So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt. 
If the government wants to find out how you voted, they won't be able to. 
No hacker can break in and find out how you voted. 
No hacker can break in and change your vote, because then it won't match your receipt. 
Votes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it. 
But the election magic doesn't stop there. 
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly. 
They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one. 
And these are elections by the people, for the people. 
So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections. 
Thank you. 
Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian. 
And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world. 
And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world, operated by the Japanese government. 
And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in Japan. 
But when I got there, I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris. 
I needed to put it into a context. 
I needed to head towards conservation goals. 
So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica. 
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica. 
But after three trips to Antarctica, I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water. 
And that same year, 10 years ago, I headed north to the Phoenix Islands. 
And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment. 
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. 
But the ocean-protected area is basically flat line until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up. 
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean. 
But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque, and we can't see what's going on. 
And therefore we're way behind on protection. 
So where are the Phoenix Islands? 
They were the world's largest marine-protected area up until last week when the Chagos Archipelago was declared. 
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere. 
It's out in the middle of the Pacific, right around the Equator. 
They've never been dived." 
And I said, "Yeah. 
But tell me where they are and the country that owns them." 
But I was in for the adventure. 
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area. 
It's a very deep-water part of our planet. 
The average depths are about 12,000 ft. 
There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands, which are specifically part of the protected area. 
Seamounts are important for biodiversity. 
There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land. 
It's an interesting fact. 
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts. 
That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies, early on, and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background. 
They're very low to the water, and they're all uninhabited, except one island has about 35 caretakers on it. 
Let's try there," and then falling into the water. 
Both my personal and my professional life changed. 
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location. 
So I thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever, but they did finally come to an end. 
And we finished our trip. 
And that's the area again. 
You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands -- that pop out of the water. 
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts. 
Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface. 
And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands? 
Where do these exist? 
Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati, and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific in three island groups. 
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands. 
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands, which is the subject that I'm talking about. 
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands. 
It's the largest atoll nation in the world. 
And they have about 110,000 people spread out over 33 islands. 
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean, and that's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet. 
And he says, "cause that's where all the money is." 
And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati? 
Because that's where all the ocean is." 
They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the Central Pacific Ocean. 
They're also a country that is in dire danger. 
The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface. 
Some of the islands have already gone under water. 
And these nations are faced with a real problem. 
We as a world are faced with a problem. 
What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet? 
So it's something we need to focus on. 
But back to the Phoenix Islands, which is the subject of this Talk. 
After I got back, I said, okay, this is amazing, what we found. 
But if you come, you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar." 
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch. 
Just get whatever anybody wants." 
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area. 
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands. 
But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did. 
And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today. 
And are you free for dinner?" 
And I was free for dinner, and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati. 
And the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives Kiribati five percent of the landed value. 
So if the United States removes a million dollars' worth of lobsters from a reef, Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars. 
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me. 
He coined the term "reverse fishing license." 
So I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'" So we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point. 
There were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing. 
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals. 
The Oak Foundation and National Geographic have been big funders of this as well. 
Halfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati, President Anote Tong. 
He said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do. 
Secondly, I'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency. 
I don't want to do something like this if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office." 
So we had very strong leadership, very good vision and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved. 
Many, many steps were taken to pull this off. 
They realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community. 
Then in 2002, when this was all going full-swing, a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands. 
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine, but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble. 
And that's the story with climate-change heating. 
It's the only threat, the only influence that the reef had to deal with. 
There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development, and the reef is on a full-bore recovery. 
He paused and put his hands together and said, "Yes, Greg, but the devil will be in the details," he said. 
And it certainly was. 
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment. 
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment. 
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago. 
So it's a fully functional up-and-running entity that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country. 
And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license and pays the country for this. 
So the conditions for success here are listed. 
You can read them yourselves. 
But I would say the most important one in my mind was working within the market forces of the situation. 
And that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati as well as the self-interest of the world. 
And I'll leave you with one final slide, that is: how do we scale this up? 
How do we realize Sylvia's dream? 
Where eventually do we take this? 
Here's the Pacific with large MPAs and large conservation zones on it. 
And as you can see, we have a patchwork across this ocean. 
I am a translator. 
I translate from biology into mathematics and vice versa. 
I write mathematical models which, in my case, are systems of differential equations, to describe biological mechanisms, such as cell growth. 
Essentially, it works like this. 
First, I identify the key elements that I believe may be driving behavior over time of a particular mechanism. 
Then, I formulate assumptions about how these elements interact with each other and with their environment. 
It may look something like this. 
Then, I translate these assumptions into equations, which may look something like this. 
Finally, I analyze my equations and translate the results back into the language of biology. 
Let me give you an example. 
What do foxes and immune cells have in common? 
They're both predators, except foxes feed on rabbits, and immune cells feed on invaders, such as cancer cells. 
And these same equations provide a framework for understanding cancer-immune interactions, where cancer is the prey, and the immune system is the predator. 
This can have some very interesting implications. 
For example, despite enormous successes in the field of immunotherapy, there still remains somewhat limited efficacy when it comes solid tumors. 
This predator-prey-shared resource type model is something I've worked on in my own research. 
And what do we know about most ecosystems from conservation biology? 
That one of the best ways to extinguish species is not to target them directly but to target their environment. 
And that's what I try to do through mathematical modeling applied to biology, and in particular, to the development of drugs. 
It's a field that until relatively recently has remained somewhat marginal, but it has matured. 
It's a pretty simple conceptual framework. 
It's all about asking the right questions. 
But it can unleash numerous opportunities for testing biological hypotheses. 
Luckily, since this is a model, we control all the assumptions. 
So we can go through them, one by one, identifying which one or ones are causing the discrepancy. 
And then we can fill this newly identified gap in knowledge using both experimental and theoretical approaches. 
It may not always be possible to separate those out experimentally. 
And some things happen so quickly or so slowly that you may physically never be able to measure them. 
Of course, this isn't the work of a modeler alone. 
It has to happen in close collaboration with biologists. 
And it does demand some capacity of translation on both sides. 
And it all comes down to asking the right question and translating it to the right equation ... 
and back. 
Thank you. 
At some point in our lives, almost every one of us will have our heart broken. 
My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school. 
She would meet her future husband by age 27, get engaged a year later and get married a year after that. 
But when Kathy turned 27, she didn't find a husband. 
She found a lump in her breast. 
Kathy recovered, though, and she was eager to resume her search for a husband as soon as her eyebrows grew back in. 
When you're going on first dates in New York City, you need to be able to express a wide range of emotions. 
The relationship was everything she hoped it would be. 
Six months later, after a lovely weekend in New England, Rich made reservations at their favorite romantic restaurant. 
Kathy knew he was going to propose, and she could barely contain her excitement. 
But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night. 
He broke up with her. 
As deeply as he cared for Kathy -- and he did -- he simply wasn't in love. 
Kathy was shattered. 
Her heart was truly broken, and she now faced yet another recovery. 
But five months after the breakup, Kathy still couldn't stop thinking about Rich. 
Her heart was still very much broken. 
The question is: Why? 
Why do so many of us flounder when we're trying to recover from heartbreak? 
Why do the same coping mechanisms that get us through all kinds of life challenges fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken? 
You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you. 
Heartbreak creates such dramatic emotional pain, our mind tells us the cause must be equally dramatic. 
Kathy's mind tricked her into initiating this wild goose chase. 
But what compelled her to commit to it for so many months? 
Heartbreak is far more insidious than we realize. 
Kathy was going through withdrawal. 
This is what makes heartbreak so difficult to heal. 
Addicts know they're addicted. 
They know when they're shooting up. 
But heartbroken people do not. 
But you do now. 
And if your heart is broken, you cannot ignore that. 
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey. 
It's a fight, and your reason is your strongest weapon. 
There is no breakup explanation that's going to feel satisfying. 
No rationale can take away the pain you feel. 
And you need something else as well: you have to be willing to let go, to accept that it's over. 
Otherwise, your mind will feed on your hope and set you back. 
Hope can be incredibly destructive when your heart is broken. 
Heartbreak is a master manipulator. 
One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it. 
All that does is make our loss feel more painful. 
We know that. 
But they were not, and neither was the relationship. 
And if you want to get over them, you have to remind yourself of that, frequently. 
None of us is immune to heartbreak. 
My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old senior executive in a software company. 
Five years after his wife died, he finally felt ready to start dating again. 
He soon met Sharon, and a whirlwind romance ensued. 
They introduced each other to their adult children after one month, and they moved in together after two. 
When middle-aged people date, they don't mess around. 
It's like "Love, Actually" meets "The Fast and the Furious." 
But the night before their first anniversary, Sharon left him. 
She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children, and she didn't want a long-distance relationship. 
Miguel was totally blindsided and utterly devastated. 
He barely functioned at work for many, many months, and he almost lost his job as a result. 
It temporarily lowers our IQ. 
But it wasn't just the intensity of Miguel's grief that confused his employers; it was the duration. 
Miguel was confused by this as well and really quite embarrassed by it. 
"What's wrong with me?" he asked me in our session. 
"What adult spends almost a year getting over a one-year relationship?" 
Actually, many do. 
Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks of traditional loss and grief: insomnia, intrusive thoughts, immune system dysfunction. 
Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression. 
Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury. 
It impacts us in a multitude of ways. 
For example, Sharon was both very social and very active. 
She had dinners at the house every week. 
She and Miguel went on camping trips with other couples. 
Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend; he lost his entire social life, the supportive community of Sharon's church. 
He lost his identity as a couple. 
The voids in your identity: you have to reestablish who you are and what your life is about. 
The voids in your social life, the missing activities, even the empty spaces on the wall where pictures used to hang. 
And it won't just be you who benefit from that. 
So if you know someone who is heartbroken, have compassion, because social support has been found to be important for their recovery. 
And have patience, because it's going to take them longer to move on than you think it should. 
But you do have weapons. 
You can fight. 
And you will heal. 
Thank you. 
For me, it was not being invited to a friend's wedding. 
At first, I didn't really mind. 
I thought he was having a small reception. 
But then I kept meeting people who were going to the same wedding, and they weren't as close to the groom as I was ... 
and I felt left out. 
That really sucked. 
It felt really unfair. 
For my daughters, Lipsi and Greta, it was last week. 
That's when I walk into the room to find Greta in a rage, shouting, "That's not fair!" 
and Lipsi in tears, and my wife holding a stopwatch to make sure that each girl had precisely one minute on the toy. 
That's because unfairness triggers us so strongly that we can't think straight. 
We become afraid and suspicious. 
Our unfairness antennae stick up. 
We feel pain, and we walk away. 
Unfairness is one of the defining issues of our society, it's one of the root causes of polarization, and it's bad news for business. 
At work, unfairness makes people defensive and disengaged. 
This is, like, half the total spent on education in the US. 
This is the size of the GDP of a country like Austria. 
So removing unfairness and promoting fairness should be our priority. 
But what does it mean in practice? 
Is it about more rules? Is it about systems? 
Is it about equality? 
Well, partly, but fairness is more interesting than rules and equality. 
Fairness works in surprising ways. 
15 years ago, I left a US investment bank to join a large Italian state-owned oil company. 
It was a different world. 
But in this company, we had fixed salaries and lifelong jobs. 
Careers were set, so my toolkit wasn't very effective, and I was frustrated. 
This was true in trading, in project management -- it was very true in exploration. 
Our exploration team was finding more oil and gas than any other company in the world. 
It was a phenomenon. 
Everyone was trying to figure out how this was possible. 
I thought it was luck, but after each new discovery, that became less and less likely. 
So did we have a special tool? No. 
Did we have a killer application that no one else had? No. 
Was it one genius who was finding oil for the whole team? 
No, we hadn't hired a senior guy in years. 
So what was our secret sauce? 
I started looking at them really carefully. 
I was nervous for him ... 
but he was so relaxed. 
I mean, these guys knew what they were doing. 
And then it hit me: it was about fairness. 
These guys were working in a company where they didn't need to worry about short-term results. 
They weren't going to be penalized for bad luck or for an honest mistake. 
They knew they were valued for what they were trying to do, not the outcome. 
They were valued as human beings. They were part of a community. 
Whatever happened, the company would stand by them. 
And for me, this is the definition of fairness. 
It's when you can lower those unfairness antennae, put them at rest. 
Then great things follow. 
These guys could be true to their purpose, which was finding oil and gas. 
They didn't have to worry about company politics or greed or fear. 
They could be good risk-takers, because they weren't too defensive and they weren't gambling to take huge rewards. 
And they were excellent team workers. 
They could trust their colleagues. 
They didn't need to look behind their backs. 
And they were basically having fun. 
And it wasn't just explorers who were doing the right thing. 
There was an HR director who proposed that I hire someone internally and give him a managerial job. 
This guy was very good, but he didn't finish high school, so formally, he had no qualifications. 
But he was so good, it made sense, and so we gave him the job. 
Or the other guy, who asked me for a budget to build a cheese factory next to our plant in Ecuador, in the village. 
It didn't make any sense: no one ever built a cheese factory. 
And so we built it. 
You can dare to be fair. 
So I realized that these guys and other colleagues were achieving great results, doing great things, in a way that no bonus could buy. 
So I was fascinated. 
I wanted to learn how this thing really worked, and I wanted to learn it also for myself, to become a better leader. 
And I've also discovered that this can work at all levels in any type of company. 
You don't need the fixed salaries or the stable careers. 
This is because science shows that humans have an innate sense of fairness. 
We know what is right and what is wrong before we can talk or think about it. 
My favorite experiment has six-month old babies watching a ball trying to struggle up a hill. 
After watching this several times, they ask the babies to pick, to choose what to play with. 
They can pick a ball, a square or a triangle. 
They never pick up the triangle. 
All the babies want to be the square. 
And science also shows that when we see or perceive fairness, our brain releases a substance that gives us pleasure, proper joy. 
But when we perceive unfairness, we feel pain ... 
even greater pain than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself. 
Motivation, creativity, teamwork, they all go way back. 
And it makes sense that we're wired this way, because we're social animals. 
We need to be part of a community to survive. 
We need to be in that community. 
This creates a beautiful fairness circle. 
But while we start off fair ... 
one drop of unfairness contaminates the whole pool, and unfortunately, there's plenty of drops in that pool. 
So our effort should be to filter out as much unfairness as we can from everywhere, starting from our communities, starting from our companies. 
So the first thing I try to do in my fairness crusade is to try to take myself out of the equation. 
That means being aware of my own biases. 
For example, I really like people who say yes to whatever I suggest. 
So we try to actively promote a culture of diversity of opinions and diversity of character. 
The second thing we do is a little more procedural. 
We then look at the culture and the motivation for the same reasons. 
That's because the last mile of fairness requires something else. 
It's about what people's emotions are, what their needs are, what's going on in their private lives, what society needs. 
These are all questions and elements that are very hard to put into a spreadsheet, into an algorithm. 
It's very hard to make them part of our rational decision. 
But if we miss these, we're missing key important points, and the outcome is likely to feel unfair. 
So we should cross-check our decisions with our fairness center switched on. 
Is it right that this guy should get the job he's really hoping to get? 
Is it right that this guy should be fired? 
Is it right that we should be charging so much for this product? 
These are tough questions. 
But if we take the time to ask ourselves whether the rational answer is the right one ... 
we all know deep inside what the answer is. 
We've known since we were babies. 
And to know what the right answer is is pretty cool for decision-making. 
So if fairness is a keystone of life, why isn't every leader making it their priority? 
Wouldn't it be cool to work in a company that was more fair? 
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to knock on the door of a Chief Fairness Officer? 
We'll get there, but why is it not happening now? 
Well, partly, it's because of inertia, partly, it's because fairness isn't always easy. 
It requires judgment and risk. 
Drilling that eighth well was a risk. 
Promoting the guy who didn't finish high school was a risk. 
Building a cheese factory in Ecuador was a risk. 
But fairness is a risk worth taking, so we should be asking ourselves, where can we take this risk? 
Where can we push ourselves a little bit further, to go beyond what's rational and do what's right? 
Thank you.
