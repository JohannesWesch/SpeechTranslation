en.20080924.34.3-400.wav	Mr President, I very much welcome the strategy set out in the White Paper, which will enable us to tackle the causes of poor nutrition and obesity and the diseases with which they are associated. Unfortunately, in Europe's food policy, whether we are talking about nutrient profiles or food labelling, or indeed in some aspects of the White Paper, we tend to resort to a very one-sided approach. We generally try to resolve Europe's problems through product policy. In my view, assuming that there are good and bad foods is fundamentally the wrong approach. As many of the amendments show, this is not the case. There are only good and bad, or balanced and unbalanced, types of diet. That should be our approach. There are many reasons why people eat the wrong type of diet. Addressing this problem by attempting to steer consumers in a particular direction with product labelling or even by introducing advertising bans or regulations or applying different VAT rates, will not bring us closer to our desired objective. I do not want to pre-empt the debate on the Food Labelling Directive, but I do believe that whatever action we take here should be guided by the principle that we should be motivating consumers to think about their eating habits. Traffic-light labelling – which is supposed to make the consumer stop and think whether he or she is about to choose a good or a bad product – is an approach which patronises consumers rather educating them and raising awareness. I would like to see a more balanced approach, along with the recognition that pursuing a solely product policy-oriented approach will not take us very far.	
en.20080924.4.3-039.wav	Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, there are no new issues in the sphere of budgetary control. Budgetary control is ongoing, and we would have been gratified to see some progress being made on the issues already on this agenda. I have five points to make. Firstly, we would urgently appeal for some support for Romania and Bulgaria in establishing the rule of law, the justice system and financial control. We do not want to be in the same position in two years' time, so this issue is very important to us. The second issue is the statement of assurance for the budget as a whole after the phased control procedure involving the national courts of audit. In the last half-year remaining to the Commission, it would be nice if we could achieve some major progress here, or at least agree on a common way forward. As budget controllers, our expectations are quite modest. The third point is simplification. We should be giving the lower tiers of administration in the Member States more help in implementing EU law. It is clear that they are completely overwhelmed by many areas of EU law, which is why the failure rates are so high. Fourthly, foreign aid: here, I would like to mention Kosovo in particular and the issue of cooperation with the United Nations. The Committee on Budgetary Control has been to Kosovo, and I would like to announce at this juncture that Kosovo will be something of an issue when it comes to the discharge of the budget. In my view, we are falling far short of the opportunities available to the European Union and have considerable ground to make up here. My fifth point is improving cooperation among the Member States in combating fraud. Here, we have homework for the ladies and gentlemen of the Council in particular. In November, the House will be voting on the regulation which provides the legal basis for combating fraud, and we will need to consider how we take this forward if we want to achieve better results in this area. At least, that is something that we have always agreed on until now.	
en.20080924.5.3-076.wav	Mr President, India and Europe need more and better contacts with each other at all levels, but particularly between ordinary people: business people, tourists and students, for example. Let me make a brief comment, which is also of relevance to the Commission's legislative programme that we were discussing earlier. In international aviation, we need good security regulations that are genuinely useful and effective and not simply token gestures. One sensible and genuinely necessary measure would therefore be to abolish the senseless rules that prevent passengers from taking liquids on board at last, and to come up with a more sensible solution.	
en.20081009.25.4-139.wav	Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution as it represents an unequivocal call to the Belarusian Government to respect human rights at last. It is disappointing that hopes of democratic development for the Belarusian people who have to live under Europe ’ s last dictatorship were not fulfilled by the parliamentary elections which took place in September and which were dubious, if not to say falsified. The same applies to the strategic repression of the opposition and civil society. We have also called on the Council and the Commission today to take further steps towards facilitating and intensifying people-to-people contacts and democratising the country and to consider the possibilities for lowering the cost of visas for Belarusian citizens entering the Schengen territory, which is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming increasingly isolated.	
en.20081021.6.2-029.wav	Madam President, I should like to start by objecting to the spirit of something we heard a few minutes ago, namely that our labour market was being overrun by foreign workers. Secondly, I should have liked to see a clearer, more unambiguous report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Confidence in the social cohesion of the European Union can be achieved only if fundamental social rights are defined as primary European law. We should send the Council, the Commission, the Member States and the European Court of Justice a stronger signal, and not content ourselves with just calling for a balance between fundamental rights and the freedoms of movement of the internal market. This will not effect change. Like liberties, fundamental social rights are human rights, and must not be curtailed as a result of internal market freedoms of movement. The important points here are that we must defend and improve the European social model and that it is high time we introduced a social progress clause as a binding protocol to the existing EU Treaties. It is time that the Posting of Workers Directive was amended such as to prevent requirements on wages and on minimum standards being limited to minimum requirements.	
en.20081022.22.3-344.wav	Mr President, I should like to join in the thanks which numerous Members have already quite rightly extended to the rapporteur, Doris Pack. In her, we have someone who is hopefully not wasting her time and effort and who truly is investing a great deal of time and effort in this area. I rejoice with her and with those who have also said that there has been some progress, including in the area of police cooperation. That is important if actual life on the ground is to be able to run along reasonable lines. Nevertheless, I believe that we must keep pointing out to our counterparts in Bosnia and Herzegovina that they personally and their side still needs to do a great deal, even more than is already being done in numerous areas. Internal cooperation and a willingness to enter into internal cooperation between the ethnic groups is something which we must permanently demand. We do not want everyone trying to go their own way. Involvement in regional cooperation in the Western Balkans is also important.	
en.20081023.4.4-034.wav	Madam President, the gap between the European Union and the citizens of Europe should not be as large as it has become. We must ensure that this gap is reduced. The Ombudsman has a very important role to play in this respect, in particular in areas where and at times when he does his job well. The most important thing is that we can count on the Ombudsman's commitment and sense of proportion. We must not raise excessive expectations which no one can meet. On the other hand, it is also about ensuring that abuses which occur in the administration of European bodies are actually dealt with and, where possible, that sensible solutions are sought which will satisfy the citizens and ensure their security. Until now the Ombudsman has shown that he takes this task seriously and performs it well. We can only hope that this will continue to be the case and thank him and the rapporteur for this report.	
en.20081117.21.1-070.wav	. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the introduction of monetary union, Europe finds itself in a major crisis. Banks are collapsing, or are being propped up with billions from national budgets; the market is collapsing, and millions of people are afraid for their jobs and their future. It is not only the market that has failed: the prevailing policy seems unable to learn from its mistakes. We take the view that serious mistakes were made in setting up Economic and Monetary Union. One of those mistakes was the structural separation of monetary and fiscal policy: one cannot create a common currency without at the same time harmonising taxation and expenditure policy, at least in broad outlines. It seems to me that the economic imbalances within the Euro Zone have increased enormously. What we now need is, indeed, better coordination of economic, and in particular taxation, policy. We need effective measures to combat tax dumping; tax havens also need to be closed and movements of capital finally need to be controlled again. The second serious mistake, in our view, lies in the structure of the Stability and Growth Pact. In times like these, anybody who thinks that budget consolidation is essential is obviously living in another world: nothing would be more disastrous than responding to this economic crisis, at this point, with obvious saving programmes. The stability pact has clearly proven that it has failed. It should be replaced by an integrated European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development. In our opinion, we need an investment offensive to renew public infrastructure and to improve the lives of socially disadvantaged groups in Europe. The third mistake, in our view, lies in the structure of the European Central Bank itself, which is not subject to any democratic supervision and which has as its sole objective price stability. We would advocate introducing democratic supervision for the European Central Bank, and we also call for the ECB ’ s monetary policy mandate to be adjusted so that, in future, growth and employment have to be given at least the same weight as price stability. The current crisis is also an opportunity for far-reaching reform of the European monetary and financial architecture. This opportunity must not just be frittered away.	
en.20081119.4.3-047.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that the motor industry is in crisis and there are many reasons for this. The financial crisis, in particular, has further accelerated the crisis in this sector and the Member States are currently working on resolutions. The European automotive industry is a key industry. For that reason, we need European solutions for this key European industry in order to defeat this crisis. Nearly all car makers have European structures. In order to be able to implement the necessary investment in environmentally friendly vehicles – as has been mentioned a number of times today – and low-consumption technologies, car makers need public guarantees or low interest credit from the European Investment Bank. The supply industry, too – and this is very important – must not be forgotten in all this. The supply industry contains small and medium-sized companies in which jobs are created and innovation occurs. Yet what can the European Union do to protect this key industry? In the last plenary part-session, the President-in-Office of the Council proposed that key industries should be protected. For me, this was a good idea, because if you take the proposal to its logical conclusion it means a ‘ Volkswagen Law ’ for the entire European motor industry. That would certainly be a sound instrument. The European Commission, however, is currently fighting against this protective instrument. Therefore, I would ask the Commission this: will it hold its grudge, despite the crisis in the motor industry, or will it change course in light of this crisis?	
en.20081120.3.4-027.wav	Mr President, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it has now become a tradition that once again no statement of assurance can be issued about the relationship between spending at a European level and administration at a national level. I can remember discussions with the previous President of the Court of Auditors, Professor Friedmann, who once said to me that, because of the structures, it was not possible to give a statement of assurance. For this reason, we should consider how this instrument can be brought to life with the aim of issuing a statement of assurance, if this is justified. It is important to make distinctions between a few different issues in this respect. Firstly, a budget that consists of around 95% subsidies is much more susceptible to fraud than a national, regional or local authority budget. This subsidy budget is largely managed by the Member States, which have demanded a great deal more independence from us in the new financing period, because they complained during the last funding period that there was too much central control. Of course, this also means that the responsibility for the budget funds must be transferred to a regional and national level. The third area is one that I just want to touch on. We must learn to distinguish between fraud and wastefulness. These are things which are often lumped together. It also annoys me when projects are funded with EU money which are not absolutely necessary. However, this is not fraud, but wastefulness. For this reason, those with responsibility for the projects, in particular in the area of structural operations, namely the Member States, should also take responsibility for ensuring that money is not wasted and that only those projects are subsidised which provide genuine added value for the region. Therefore, we should also consider moving parts of structural operations onto interest-free loans. If Member States have to pay back the money, they will only fund the projects that they really need.	
en.20081203.13.3-092.wav	Mr President, I am not alone in finding it difficult to join in with this emerging self-importance of the European decision-makers when it comes to management of the financial market crisis, for if Europe, if the EU were a functioning democracy, one would first have to raise the question of responsibility and how it could all have happened. It is simply not true that all the problems we are now facing involve a tsunami, something caused by Nature. This is man-made. With all this regulatory fervour that characterises this Union, one asks oneself why action was not taken when banks began to cross national borders to an appreciable extent? Why, in spite of corresponding warnings, was action not taken when derivatives crept in. I clearly remember that Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz addressed all these points. There was a silence, a taboo. That is where you would have to start because recognising one ’ s own faults is the only key to finding the solution in future.	
en.20081203.13.3-098.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my question relates to what you think about Iceland and Hungary introducing the euro as a second currency. Do you think that that could solve the problem of these two countries? The second question is: do you think that it would be possible to introduce a risk premium for derivatives which would then be used to strengthen the banks ’ own capital? My third question is: do you not think that a reduction in value added tax would encourage imports, in particular from China and India? Would it not make more sense to consider tax reductions for our businesses and for our employees, to pay investment premiums, to focus on progressive depreciation and above all to increase assets of a minor value by a factor of ten to avoid taxing fictitious profits and to keep the money in the enterprise, thus also enabling wages to be paid more easily?	
en.20081217.21.3-296.wav	Madam President, this comprehensive report makes clear how many human rights violations take place in the world every day. This is particularly alarming 60 years after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a call to us to redouble our efforts. For this reason, too, I advocate elevating the present Subcommittee on Human Rights to the status of full committee. Today we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia, who champions the causes of human rights and the environment in China. Since he is in prison, however, he was unable to receive it in person. This brings shame on China. In addition, tomorrow this House will be debating human rights violations in Russia. Our relations with both of these countries must attach greater importance not only to economic interests but also, in particular, to human rights. We call for freedom for Hu Jia in China and for Mikhail Khodorkovsky in Russia.	
en.20081217.23.3-343.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, one makes interesting discoveries, for example, that everyone talks about combating fraud but no one does anything. Another discovery is that Member States work out all their payments to the European Union to the last cent, but when it comes to spending this money, they start feeling generous and even make it easier for fraudsters, for example, by still taking an average of 36 months to even report irregularities to the European Union. The European Parliament considers this unacceptable. We want to see an effective fight against fraud, one that includes prevention. We want Member States to put the fight against fraud on the agenda and we want to see a joint discussion about what we need and what the problems are. We want to see the national judicial authorities taking a greater interest in following up the results of OLAF investigations. There must be an end to the legal loopholes that have existed up to now for fiddles. We need European funds to be treated in the same way as national funds. We want an independent office with the resources and legal bases necessary to perform its tasks. We want an office that can work together with Member States quietly and efficiently. Our opinion on the legal basis, Regulation 1073 / 99, covers all these points. Our plea is for this Regulation – which is at the heart of OLAF – to be further developed together with the Council. We call on the Council to incorporate our opinion and open talks on the further development of this Regulation. We want to provide a solution to OLAF ’ s problems. I wish to thank all the groups in the House for lending their support to this in the form of a resolution, too, on which we shall be voting tomorrow. I would appeal to the French and Czech Council Presidencies to take Parliament ’ s ball and to pass it back. In our proposals, we have also taken up solutions developed and put forward by the Council working party. I wish to assure you of our interest in bringing this Regulation to a speedy conclusion, and of our willingness to engage in constructive discussions on the basis of our proposals. Consolidating all the legal bases for OLAF, as the Council envisages, would mean wasting a lot more time over an uncertain outcome. OLAF will soon be celebrating its 10 anniversary. Consolidation would mean a further 10 years without an improvement in the legal basis. We are too serious about combating fraud to let this happen. That is why we want to do what is doable now in cooperation with the Council. Thank you very much.	
en.20081217.3.3-057.wav	Mr President, I should like to take up a point raised by my Austrian colleague, Mr Rübig, a little while ago. We are spending less than 1% of European Gross Domestic Product on Europe and, at the same time, requiring the EU to cope with more and more tasks for more and more Member States. This does not add up! In the light of this, it is really incredible that we have been on an economy drive for many years, one that has involved not only the economical use of our funds but also, basically, the Finance Ministers reclaiming money and channelling it into their national budgets at the end of the year. There are enough new tasks we should be spending our money on. There are also tasks to which we have not really been allocating due budgetary funds for years. The expenditure on EU information policy ought to be significantly increased if we really wish to draw European citizens closer to Europe. There are a great many tasks in the field of student and trainee exchanges in which Europe could become involved.	
en.20081218.3.4-048.wav	Mr President, it is good that integration in the justice sector, hitherto traditionally the preserve of the nation-states, is making progress. This is consistent with the changes in living conditions of the people of our Union. However – an observation that has already been made several times – this integration must not intrude too far into structures which have evolved by tradition and, most importantly, which work. Not everything can be measured by the same yardstick. The organisation of authentic instruments and public registrars is completely different in many Member States. In Austria, but not only there, the notary ’ s office enjoys a long tradition and a high level of security and confidence as a public registrars ’ office. This must not be jeopardised without good cause; that is, merely because such professions do not exist elsewhere. Therefore, I say ‘ yes ’ to integration and mutual opening-up, but in a balanced way.	
en.20090112.14.1-100.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, plant protection products were, and still are, essential agricultural resources. Farmers require a minimum selection of plant protection products because it is a matter of protecting the indigenous cultural landscape, producing top-quality food and protecting resources. Our debates about chemicals are too often conducted on a very irrational level. We must think and act rationally if we are to achieve sensible results. The effects of Parliament's original position would have been fatal: a blanket ban on plant protection products would result in lower agricultural yields and, ultimately, rising food prices. Therefore, I am happy that an acceptable compromise was found in the trialogue negotiations. It is welcome that we have retained the three-zone ruling even with considerable exemptions for Member States. A courageous step to a consistent internal market solution would look different at this stage: Alongside the acceptable compromises achieved, we should not second guess a final definition of endocrinically effective substances but actually allow the Commission its four years to produce a scientifically-based definition. Otherwise, we will overstretch the precautionary principle here. I find it regrettable that we are not permitting any impact assessment of the agreement now reached.	
en.20090219.28.4-091.wav	() Madam President, the last time that there was such a demonstration of opinion during a visit by a Head of State or Government, the President of this House intervened very strongly. On that occasion it related to a matter that was also of concern to him personally, namely the Treaty of Lisbon. Today, when the President, the sovereign elected President of a country, is speaking and is interrupted and hassled to such an extent by the socialists, the President does nothing. Do you know what this is? This is not democracy, this is despotism. I demand that the appropriate measures be taken.	
en.20090310.36.2-499.wav	Madam President, children and politics – rarely are the interests of the citizens and of the politicians so far apart. For citizens throughout Europe, the subject of children is right at the top of their priorities. For politicians, children ’ s issues are also-ran issues, as we can see again here, too. I do not know of a single country with a dedicated ministry for children, nor is there a dedicated representative for the interests of our youngest citizens in the Commission. In Parliament, the subject of children is spread across all the committees. That is why I would like to give special mention to the Commission today, as it is dealing here with childcare facilities and the Barcelona objective. Thank you ever so much. In the parliamentary working group on Quality of childhood, we observed that our children live in a very complicated world. The future for those who are children right here, right now – today – is completely uncertain. A child of today can climb right to the top of the social ladder or fall right down to the bottom. Such children can remain in their own cultural circle or they can search out another one. They can follow a similar life path to their parents or do the exact opposite. They can marry someone from the opposite sex or someone of their own sex. More than 50 years ago, when we launched the project of uniting Europe, all that was completely different. The diversity that characterises us as Europeans has become a decisive factor in the lives of children. The concept of diversity must, therefore, find its way into what teachers and others engaged in educating our children teach. Far too little attention is paid to this at present. Europe ’ s childcare facilities and schools are, after all, cracking under the strain of the challenge of integration. We need to press the reset button when it comes to matters of integration and start again from scratch. Let us approach this subject completely free of prejudice again, according to the slogan ‘ stop it through diversity ’. In addition, I would ask all the MEPs after me not only to come out and advocate gender mainstreaming, but to fight for child mainstreaming, too – especially in this time of global financial crisis – because, otherwise, we will saddle our children with immeasurable debts.	
en.20090310.6.2-060.wav	Mr President, I want to keep this short. I would like to offer my thanks for the constructive contributions that I have heard Members make to the debate today. To conclude, I just have a couple more things to say. Firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for not categorically arguing against the concept of minimum requirements for the safety network. This proposal is no work of the devil, nor is it a bureaucratic monster. It is an instrument for solving problems and one that we should give a chance to. For that reason I would like to take this opportunity just to call for your support for it once again. The other thing I wanted to say I will direct at my British friends, and ‘ across all the parties ’. My dear British friends, I do understand, Caroline, I can see your problem. I can well understand that the energy security of a country will be put above compliance with an air pollution limit for a certain period of time. I have a lot of sympathy for that. I am also the last person who would fail to grant Her Majesty additional time when it comes to building new coal-fired power stations. This is something that we can talk about. The problem is that that is exactly what we have not done. At no point in the last four months has this conversation taken place. I want to urge you, at this point – looking forward to second reading now – to be open-minded once again and to say ‘ let us talk about a compromise now ’ and, to that end, to give up the resistance – which, in my view, is completely irrational – and the fundamental opposition to the minimum standards, which is unjustifiable from the point of view of either competition policy or environmental policy. I think that a compromise can be reached on this, something I also hope to see at the end of the second reading. Incidentally, I am not of the view that we should not seek compromises at first reading. This legislation is too complex for that. I do not wish to end this parliamentary term as rapporteur and hand on legislation to the next Parliament where the text of the directive that is debated is inconsistent, illogical and contradictory. I therefore ask for your support for the compromises when we vote in an hour ’ s time.	
en.20090311.3.3-033.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decisive question in relation to all the economic recovery plans which are being put in place throughout Europe is, of course: who will receive the money? Will more blank cheques be drawn up for the banks, although in the long run, it would be significantly cheaper for the taxpayer if they were nationalised straight away? Should we relieve the burden on large companies and high wage earners although they have benefited from tax concessions across the whole of Europe for years? The more money is wasted on things like this, the more likely it is that the programmes will fail and that the European economy will find itself in a very dangerous downward spiral. The long-term policy of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation has resulted in an increasing concentration of wealth among the top ten thousand. In addition, it was this policy which was responsible for the crisis that we find ourselves in today. Anyone who believes that the crisis can be overcome by continuing this policy with just a few modifications has completely failed to understand the situation. What we need is exactly the opposite. Instead of buying up banks ’ toxic assets, we should be spending taxes on renovating schools and hospitals and on greening the European economy. If public funds are given to private companies, the rule of no taxes without guaranteed jobs and, in particular, no taxes without public ownership rights must apply, so that the state and, above all, citizens can benefit from any future earnings. The best economic recovery plan of all would be a radical redistribution of wealth and assets from top to bottom. The low pay sector in Europe must be reduced in size rather than continually being fostered. We need higher minimum wages and better social services in Europe. We need tax rates which ensure that the millionaires and profiteers from the old finance market party take responsibility for the huge losses which have been incurred, not the majority of citizens who have not benefited at all from the financial boom. I believe that social justice is now the only sensible economic policy. It is the only way of bringing this disastrous crisis to an end.	
en.20090323.13.1-055.wav	Mr President, at the beginning of March, political prisoners Mikhail Khodorkowski and Platon Lebedev were transferred from Chita, in Siberia, to Moscow, in order to once again face untenable accusations. The first public hearing is due to take place on 31 March. The fifth round of human rights consultations between the EU and Russia was due to take place on the same day. The Russians have now deferred these important talks indefinitely. Russia is thus making it very clear just how little it values human rights. Rather than administering justice, the judicial system continues to serve the purpose of eliminating opponents of the regime, and the wool is being pulled over the eyes of the EU.	
en.20090323.15.1-120.wav	Mr President, thank you very much, Commissioner, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for once again highlighting the ban on animal testing, as it has reminded me that this is now the third revision of the cosmetic products legislation that I have had the privilege to be involved in, these revisions being the sixth amendment, the seventh amendment, and now the change to a regulation. We have, indeed, succeeded in banning animal testing. We have, for example, managed to ensure that consumers know the shelf life of a product, by means of a small box containing a number which tells them how long a product can be used for. I am also addressing these comments to certain colleagues, such as Mrs Roithová, who unfortunately were not able to be present at the start of this debate. Labels have never, at any point, been warnings. If a product is not safe, it should not be brought onto the market, it should not be marketed. All products on the European market have to be safe and harmless. However, labelling allows consumers to choose. That is what democracy is all about, and that is what freedom of choice is all about. We have an excellent piece of legislation. I have tried to make the process very transparent. I have tried, as Mrs Grossêtete has said, to bring together various opinions. This is because I wanted to ensure that we draw up legislation which is good for everyone, namely for the consumers in the European Union, for industry, which will have to work with this legislation, and, finally, for everyone who benefits from it. I would just like once again to say to Mr Schnellhardt that yes, deodorants work differently on different people, but the claim is nevertheless made that they ‘ keep you sweat-free ’. That is why it is important that the claims concerning the deep rings around my eyes after a week in Strasbourg are, to a certain extent, true and reliable. Once again, I would like to thank the Commissioner, particularly for the explanations he has given, as well as my colleagues and my co-workers, who have done most of the work. Thank you very much.	
en.20090324.3.2-045.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr van Nistelrooij on the Green Paper and the future form of cohesion policy is certainly one of the most important reports produced by the Committee on Regional Development in recent years. We agree with the fundamental concept of the Green Paper, which states that the purpose of territorial cohesion is to ensure the polycentric development of the EU as a whole, the sustainable development of the territories with their different features and characteristics and, at the same time, the preservation of their diversity. A more comprehensive system offering gradual help for transition regions which exceed the threshold of 75% of gross domestic product must be established in the next programming period, so that these regions have a clear status and can develop in greater security. Mrs Krehl ’ s report on the obstacles to the use of Structural Funds rightly lists the major problems faced by applicants in claiming Structural Funds, such as excessive bureaucracy, too many complex regulations or the slow and cumbersome centrally managed administration in the Member States. Many recommendations are made to the Commission about the effective measures which need to be taken to remove these obstacles. I would like to single out two of these measures and reinforce them. Firstly, project leaders must currently keep project documents for a period of 10 years in order to be able to produce them for inspection by the Commission. This regulation imposes an excessive bureaucratic burden on small projects in particular. It is right that this period should now be reduced to three years. Secondly, the evaluation criteria used by the Commission for innovative projects are causing significant problems. The same criteria should not be applied to innovative projects as to other projects. It is essential that a different process is used in this case.	
en.20090324.32.2-435.wav	Madam President, if Europe provides money and, in particular, if the Member States provide a lot of money to help the car industry out of its crisis, it cannot only be a question of maintaining the status quo and preventing bankruptcies, because a number of other concerns are involved. The most important of these have already been mentioned. This is about ensuring that people who are looking for jobs and who need jobs can find them in the long term. Therefore, we must provide more support for new technologies, innovation and, most importantly, for sustainable transport systems than we have done in the past. For this reason, we should link all our measures to these objectives, so that we do not have to reproach ourselves in a few years time with the fact that, if we had thought about this years ago, we would not be in the next new crisis.	
en.20090324.37.2-501.wav	Madam President, it would be good if you could allow me the additional half a minute which Mrs Breyer from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has just had. The Commission has submitted a good proposal for updating the regulation on novel foods. Unfortunately, some amendments have been tabled with the aim of adding objectives to this proposal which are not compatible with the goals of the regulation or which even interfere with existing case law. The obligation on food suppliers to monitor novel foods in terms of the health and welfare of animals would impose too great a burden on retailers. Once again an attempt is being made to undermine existing GMO legislation, in this case the call for special labelling for novel foods which come from animals that have been fed genetically modified feedstuffs. We have already heard about all of this. Anything which involves GMO legislation should not be included in the regulation on novel foods. I say this, but I myself tabled an amendment to distinguish between new plant types and the definition of novel foods. However, interested parties in this House must not be allowed to misuse the regulation on novel foods for electioneering purposes. Amendments 62 and 90, for which the Greens have requested a vote by roll call, are obviously an attempt of this kind. Who are you aiming to pillory for this? My group has always supported the right of the consumer to know what foods contain. Why should there not be a reference to nanosubstances in the list of ingredients? Although amendment 62 makes a rather clumsy attempt to anticipate my report on food labelling, I must say that I believe that the labelling of novel foods is fully compatible with my report. Therefore I recommend that my group votes in favour of the amendments. In my report on food labelling regulations, I will refer to the part of the regulation on novel foods which concerns labelling. This will be possible because the first reading on the labelling of foods has been postponed to the next parliamentary term, against the Greens ’ wishes. However, it has now become clear how beneficial this postponement was for them. A brief remark on cloning. It is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it. Nevertheless foods must be included in this regulation, because otherwise...

en.20090326.2.4-012.wav	. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by making it clear that the distribution of food to deprived people is, for me, not at issue in the forthcoming vote on the report by Mr Siekierski, particularly in these difficult economic times. I would therefore also like to make it clear at the outset that it was not easy to find a common line within our Group. I therefore respect the personal decision of any member of the Group to deviate from this and not to support our intended rejection of the report. Why am I unable to support the result of the committee vote as it stands? There are a number of reasons for this, which have absolutely nothing to do with helping deprived people within the European Union in these difficult economic times. On the contrary, amendments tabled by my colleague Mr Busk on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although unfortunately found not to be permissible, were intended to give the existing system a future-oriented foundation. The system in place up to now is an anachronism from the times of agricultural overproduction, which fortunately are now a thing of the past. Due to the successful decoupling of direct payments, the intervention stocks have been constantly decreasing in recent years, with the result that, today, up to 85% of the food has to be purchased on the free market. However, that has altered the fundamental nature of the programme and has resulted in the loss of the agricultural dimension to the programme. Since we are now dealing with a social programme, we need to create an appropriate legal basis for it. In this regard, we share the view of the Council ’ s legal services that the only possible legal basis in place of Article 37 of the EC Treaty regarding the common agricultural policy is Article 308, as otherwise it would clearly constitute an encroachment on the national competences of the Member States. In view of the impermissible nature of our amendments, the only solution can be a new draft from the European Commission. The Commission should also take to heart the principle of co-financing, as whether or not such programmes are meaningful in the mind of everyone can only be satisfactorily assessed at local level.	
en.20090326.3.4-047.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that we, too, in principle welcome the European Commission ’ s proposal and this Green Paper. As previous speakers have said, there is no doubt that there is a ‘ mass ’ phenomenon in which relatively small losses affect a large number of people. The individual losses are small, but taken together the overall amount is large. We need an instrument to deal with this problem. In my opinion, it is right to consider something like this. Staying with the positives, I also very much welcome the fact that, in its Green Paper, the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has also placed a definite emphasis on the issue of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. That is very different to the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition, which was also debated in this House yesterday and which has so far completely ignored the possibility of out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms. I think that the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has come further in its Green Paper than the members of the Directorate General for Competition. However, I would like to make two things quite clear, which in my opinion should definitely be viewed as critical comments. In a few minutes at noon, Parliament will adopt my report on the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition. With a huge majority in this House we will demand that the European Commission choose a horizontal approach in dealing with this issue. We must not end up with sectoral instruments: one for the area of consumer protection, one of the area of antitrust law, another one for the capital market, perhaps another one for the environment, perhaps another one for social affairs, all contradicting each other, all encroaching on the legal systems of the Member States and leading ultimately to legal confusion that can no longer be managed by any practitioner. We have often seen such examples in the past. I am just thinking about the debate on the Professional Qualifications Directive, which we later also combined in a single instrument because this fragmentation was no longer manageable. The Commission should not make the same mistake again in this case. It should advocate a horizontal approach right from the outset. That is the clear position of Parliament, as will become apparent in a few minutes. One last point: I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed that we do not want a claims industry based on the American model with a turnover of USD 240 billion a year from which ultimately only lawyers profit and the consumers get absolutely nothing. We want the genuine rule of law in Europe and we want to keep our traditional system and our understanding of the law.	
en.20090401.15.3-164.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many ways of tackling the lasting effects of the unforeseen financial and economic crisis. This revision package, this legislative measure within the European Economic Recovery Plan, was conceived as a good – albeit not quite sufficient – response to this temporary, though exceptionally critical, situation. It responds, amongst other things, to the request for greater simplification of procedures and increased flexibility in the application of the existing rules under the Structural Funds Regulation that has been repeatedly put forward by the European Parliament in recent years. I should like to emphasise that it is also to be welcomed that an amendment to Article 7 – ‘ Eligibility of Expenditure ’ – is to enable EU Member States and regions to invest in energy-efficiency and renewable-energy measures in housing with the support of the EU Structural Funds, and that this measure is not only intended for low-income households. The relevant amendment rightly eliminates the reference to ‘ low-income households ’, therefore, and instead imposes a ceiling of 4% of the total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) allocation for each Member State for such expenditure. This is just one of the many improvements proposed. In short, bringing this overall package to fruition would accelerate expenditure and thus make available further liquidity from the ERDF, European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds for the implementation of the necessary objectives, and would simplify rules allowing for a speedy implementation of programmes. In my opinion, this represents an effective, albeit as yet insufficient, contribution to dealing with the current crisis.	
en.20090402.6.4-034.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the European Ecolabel. It is right that we should make a new attempt to spread the Community Ecolabel further. I also think it is right that we will be retaining the voluntary nature of the scheme in future. In future, the label scheme will only be implemented where clear criteria and yardsticks apply, which must be met before the Ecolabel may be used. In this regard, I call on the Commission to draw up sensible, clear and comprehensible criteria. The idea of attracting people to the scheme must be at the heart of this. It would be a great shame if the establishment of the Ecolabel were to fail due to bureaucratic obstacles. It will be the consumer, at the end of the day, who decides whether the Ecolabel succeeds or fails, as it is with consumers that the scheme must find acceptance. Attached as I am to the Blue Angel ecolabel that we have in Germany, it must not be a question of personal preference, at the end of the day, but rather it comes down to conveying to consumers at a single glance what specific qualities a product has. There will only be added value for consumers if the Member States do not use their own symbols and there is ultimately a uniform symbol at the European level. A jumble of symbols alienates consumers rather than informing them. One symbol, one conclusion – that is what we should all be working towards together.	
en.20090421.19.2-152.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, during this parliamentary term, we have together made some progress with regard to the discharge procedure for the European institutions. However, I regret that it has taken so long, because in principle we have only now finished what was outlined at the time of the resignation of the Commission in 1999 – in other words 10 years ago. This shows that we quite definitely need to make improvements to our procedures and methods of working and to ensure that the necessary transparency appears quicker when it comes to citizens discovering what their taxes are used for. I would particularly like to thank Mr Casaca, with whom I had the honour of working on the discharge of Parliament for the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I very much regret that a fellow Member who has made very many comments in the press on various matters relating to the European Parliament is not participating either in the debates or the votes in committee nor in the debate here in plenary. This is something I want to say very clearly at this point, so that it is retained and remains for posterity! We know very well that there have been and still are a number of problems here, and it is the MEPs who are here now who over the last five years have ensured that the necessary reforms are made in numerous places in the interests of the MEPs. For this, I offer my very sincere thanks to everyone. We have done what we needed to do and we have not released all of the information widely via the media and then not participated. Thank you for your positive cooperation.	
en.20090421.19.2-159.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Audy report – my sincere thanks to the rapporteur – really takes us a step further forward, because it contains innovative elements such as naming and shaming – a milestone in budgetary control. This means targeted criticism instead of general complaints. The fact that the Socialist Group is now backing down and would rather sweep the truth under the carpet is scandalous and does a disservice to our control activities. The credibility of Parliament is on the line and I appeal to my fellow Members not to allow that to happen. I would like to say something about our biggest problems, Romania and Bulgaria. The failure of the Commission in connection with the preparation for the accessions of these countries is most evident here. We have lost a lot of money. The Commission sat back and watched for a long time and did not freeze the funds until 2008. In the meantime, however, over EUR 1 billion was lost in connection with Bulgaria and around EUR 142 million in connection with Romania. Freezing funds is no solution to the problems, however. The cooperation and verification mechanism, for which the President of the Commission himself is responsible, is a paper tiger, and the progress reports are not worthy of the name. The Audy report makes suggestions as to how this could be improved. The European Commission deceived Parliament about the readiness of these countries for accession and the Commissioner for Enlargement should in fact learn a lesson from this. We are interested in the management of future accessions, however, and therefore this topic remains on the agenda. Our Group will grant discharge to the Commission, but, personally, I will refuse to grant it discharge. Unfortunately, the Commission ’ s zeal for reform, a tiny spark of which we were once again able to detect over the last year, has already been extinguished again. There is a standstill in connection with combating fraud, nothing is happening with regard to prevention and there is no desire for more ethical behaviour, among other things. One thing the Commission, and Commissioner Kallas in particular, should be clear about is that whoever wishes to be in the new Commission is dependent on the support of Parliament.	
en.20090422.59.3-464.wav	Mr President, we have a problem with copyright and we have a problem with remuneration for artists. So we should and we must become proactive and do something here. However, if we become proactive, then it is important that we react to the challenges of the digital era and not flog dead horses. Let me explain how I arrived at this image. The proposal before us actually only honours one single promise, and that is the promise to promote the music industry. If we were to address what is actually happening with the artists and their income and calculate that, we would arrive at averages that are clearly too low for artists to support themselves and get something out of it. Moreover, this money does not go directly to artists. The fund is too small to achieve anything. An artist with whom I discussed this told me that a redistribution was taking place here between the quick and the dead. I had to contradict him: it is a redistribution between artists and producers, the music industry, and then only the big names. All in all, Commissioner, this proposal is not appropriate. We need to find something better. We need, for example, to create something like a flat rate. Even the proposals you make in connection with the ‘ use-it-or-lose-it ’ clause are still theoretical law. Please can we do something clever and well-founded, just as the artists recommended and requested in our hearing in the Committee on Legal Affairs.	
en.20090422.60.3-483.wav	Mr President, I join the rapporteur, Gilles Savary, in expressing my regret that the Commission did not go through with its original plan for an integrated action plan. There are many good reasons why everyone involved, from local authorities through to the European Union, is trying to improve urban transport conditions. We know that most people in Europe live in towns and that current transport conditions are anything but optimal. That is why there is agreement in principle to make integrated proposals at Parliament ’ s initiative on the plan and on Mr Savary ’ s report. I thank him for his commitment and for his specific proposals. At the same time, however, I should like to make it abundantly clear that what many fear or believe they should fear will not happen. No one wants to take the right to configure traffic conditions away from the municipalities or the local or regional authorities. We merely want to help from the European side to ensure that action is taken on the basis of reasonable common rules where a municipality, a town or a regional entity considers it reasonable. The principle of subsidiarity is not in danger. What we want to do here will help to protect that principle. That is why we shall continue, in the interests of the citizens, to try and ensure that, when a citizen drives another ten or twenty kilometres in Europe, he does not stumble upon a traffic-calming zone which he believes to be the same as in his home district, only to find that totally different rules apply. No one wants to impose some sort of congestion charge or other rules on communities, but if they are used, then they should be used within a framework which citizens recognise. We have been in agreement on the sense in taking a common approach to traffic signs for over 100 years. This should also apply in future to this issue.	
en.20090422.60.3-487.wav	Mr President, we have been debating urban transport in the EU for a very long time. Why exactly? We are not even competent for it. Competence was originally devised because about 80% of the population live in towns and, due to climate change, we now want to take this on. Fortunately, thanks to our protests, we were able to reduce these ambitions on the part of the European Commission to an action plan on urban transport. My thanks to Commissioner Tajani for his insight. means to support rather than to prescribe, but of course, as an Italian, he knows that better than I, as a German with A-level Latin. What is important to me, first and foremost, is that our report, Parliament ’ s report should highlight strict compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Legislative measures at European level are inadmissible for urban traffic. Supportive measures are what we are here for. Brainstorming and encouraging the exchange of best practices make sense. We do not all need to reinvent the bicycle. Our towns need bespoke solutions, but they can only be worked out by local players, because only they know what is needed. Municipalities need to take account of very diverse situations and they therefore need sufficient room for manoeuvre, especially if they are to keep their high streets alive. They are important to the attractiveness of a town. It is therefore important not to exclude private cars and to focus more on logistics in the town. I should therefore like to see more support for research into inner-city retail logistics. That would take some of the strain off a city. It is also important to take account of demographic change. Our society is constantly ageing. Mobility requirements and residential requirements are changing. If we want to reduce traffic, people need to be able to obtain their everyday requirements close to home, and that is also a challenge to the retail trade. Anything else would simply promote the countryside. We do not need an urban mobility observatory. It would cost a great deal of money and generate a great deal of paper, which would simply be filed away in Brussels.	
en.20090422.61.3-504.wav	Madam President, I unconditionally support the Commission ’ s aim of creating a legal framework for the coordinated introduction and use of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport. My personal long-standing fight for the mass introduction of eCall, the electronic emergency callout system, brings the urgency of this home to me almost daily, and intelligent transport systems can do so much more. They contribute towards environmental sustainability, improved efficiency, enhanced safety and non-discriminatory competitiveness in road passenger and freight traffic. They also support co-modality, including by developing interfaces with other modes of transport such as rail, waterways and aviation, which started to incorporate intelligent transport systems a long time ago. All this cannot be achieved by the Member States alone; it can only be achieved as a Community task. Intelligent transport systems based on EU-wide compulsory minimum underlying standards and specifications improve the environment for innovation and create planning security, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. I welcome in particular the planned open, vehicle-integrated platform for intelligent transport system services. The action plan at last includes a timetable for the introduction of individual systems a) for safety in road transport, such as ESP and eCall, b) for continuity in traffic management; for example, information on congestion charges or parking management reduces the number of cars driving round looking for a parking place, c) to use road, traffic and travel data in real time, which will be an asset both to professional lorry drivers and everyone else using the roads. The directive sets out detailed requirements for the compulsory and coordinated introduction of standard intelligent transport systems throughout the EU and their application in the Member States. It also safeguards the use of personal data. But beware, the introduction of intelligent transport systems will cost a lot of money, because infrastructures and vehicles will need to be fitted with the necessary information and communications technology. We still know too little about whether potential users are willing or able to pay.	
en.20090423.5.4-097.wav	. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that we support helping people with rare diseases. That said, Amendment 15 is completely unacceptable from an ethical point of view. There must never again be a debate in Europe about whose life is worth living and whose not. There must be no political and social pressure on parents in Europe to consciously decide against having a disabled child. The selection of embryos would represent an opening of the ethical floodgates. For that reason we must reject this amendment. It is not enough just to remove the word ‘ eradicate ’, which is actually, it is sad to say, in line with fascist language use. Doing so would mean that we would still be faced with the selection of embryos. It would be insufferable if this amendment and its idea of selecting embryos were to become a stepping stone to a new ethics in Europe. We must stand up resolutely against genetic discrimination. Amendment 15 must therefore be rejected in its entirety. Otherwise, our group will, unfortunately, be forced to come out against this report even though the rest of it is highly positive.	
en.20090423.58.4-235.wav	Mr President, for the first time since becoming a Member of this House, I voted in the vote on discharge against discharge of the Commission and I should like to explain my reasons: my basic concern is the manner in which the European Commission handled the accession of the two new countries, namely Romania and Bulgaria. We have a great many problems to contend with in Romania and Bulgaria, with widespread corruption, with a lot of money, a lot of European money that has gone missing. The European Commission did not start freezing this money until 2008. We lost a great deal of money in 2007 and now have to contend with control systems which are barely even there or control systems which only function intermittently. In Romania we have extensive corruption and problems with the judiciary to contend with. All this has to be blamed on the pre-accession process. I want to give a sign, to say to the European Commission that, in future, it must deal with accessions differently and to also say to it that, had it been observed in other countries in the past, it could be progressing much more successfully now had it wanted to. I should like to call on the Commission to help both countries put financial control systems in place that are worthy to be called as much and to help rectify the systemic weaknesses in these two countries. Otherwise we shall have a permanent problem here, a permanent pain in the neck for the whole of Europe.	
en.20090424.13.5-109.wav	Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that behind me, among the far-right radicals, there are people who are not Members, and as far as I can see, they are also using the voting cards.	
en.20090424.4.5-037.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the draft report by Mr Schnellhardt and would like to thank him for his fine work. After the numerous crises in recent years in connection with products of animal origin that pose a risk to human and animal health, a comprehensive statutory regulation is essential. A revision of the current regulation was necessary. Now, as before, we need to ensure a high degree of safety. Although we essentially support the report, there are a few points which give me cause for concern. Many points in the regulation have been made less stringent and thus make trade in animal by-products somewhat easier. Let me give some examples of what I am talking about. It is permitted to use certain Category 1 material in pet food. Category 2 or 3 material may, irrespective of the risk associated with it, be disposed of more easily, under official supervision, if there are only small quantities of waste per week. The risk associated with animal by-products of any category is only partly determined by its quantity. It remains the case that it is the European Commission that will enact the implementing regulation and, like its predecessor, the draft contains a lot of authorisations for the Commission. This means that the Commission can lay down comprehensive and fundamental regulations for handling animal by-products in the comitology procedure, with the result that Parliament – as is unfortunately often the case – is excluded.	
en.20090424.6.5-062.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Afghanistan has had a difficult history. I believe that families in particular stick together very strongly in that country and that the woman of the family has an important role. It is therefore very important above all to promote economic development and in particular support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Of course, a modern infrastructure is also needed to enable the country to develop better. I believe that it is precisely infrastructure projects that could help to create a greater understanding for one another in this country and that also through the agency of information and communications technology a different world view could slowly develop there, whilst fully retaining the country ’ s identity.	
en.20090504.23.1-209.wav	. Mr President, marine pollution is only the focus of interest when there has been a dramatic accident. Then there are serious debates about the threats to our oceans from this ongoing pollution. Unfortunately, the subject is always largely ignored in the interim. We must take seriously the constant and repeated violations of the law which make just as significant and just as dramatic a contribution to the threat not only to our oceans but also to our coastlines. I would like to thank my fellow Members with whom we were able to discuss the issue for taking a consistent approach to the protection of our oceans. I come from a landlocked country, but nevertheless, as a European, I feel responsible for protecting our oceans against ongoing pollution caused by cheap business interests and for integrating the principles of the third maritime package, which is urgently needed, as the Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed.	
en.20090506.37.3-305.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Obiols i Germà, on his very good report. Things look very bad for respect for human rights in many countries worldwide. This is also of relevance for Europe – when we think of Belarus for instance. The European Union must therefore redouble its efforts by implementing its human rights policy in all areas and by setting clear standards. It is our understanding that human rights are indivisible. This can be taken into consideration for example during the negotiations for a new agreement with Russia through a binding human rights clause, which will influence all areas of the negotiations. I should also like to suggest once again that the Subcommittee on Human Rights be made a standing committee.	
en.20090506.37.3-307.wav	Madam President, the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on the Government and the Communist Party of China to conduct the upcoming human rights dialogue in a constructive manner. This would significantly ease relations between the EU and China. We have a genuine interest in improving bilateral relations. However, this dialogue must be conducted honestly. We will therefore have to uphold our legitimate demands on China. In our view, the civil rights campaigner, Hu Jia, must be released immediately. Talks with the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of the Tibetans, must be resumed. The Chinese region of Tibet must be opened up to journalists and UN human rights experts. In my opinion, the People ’ s Republic of China demonstrated in the run-up to the Olympic Games that it could, for example, grant more press freedom while preserving the stability of the country. Now, it should have the courage to initiate reforms relating to re ­ education camps, the rights of defendants, the death penalty, religious freedom and freedom of assembly. It should genuinely tackle these human rights and hold talks with us.	
en.20090506.41.3-443.wav	Mr President, Vice-President, President Klaus reacted to today ’ s decision in the Czech Senate, which we sincerely welcome and on which I offer my hearty congratulations, by, amongst other things, claiming that the Treaty of Lisbon was dead, because it had been rejected in the Irish referendum. He is a political zombie launching an attack against the majority decisions of his own Parliament and the Senate and confirming his unfortunate and sectarian attitude in other policy areas as well. Fortunately, after the positive votes, he is merely making himself look very silly. We, the Greens, have a positive and constructive attitude towards the process of European integration, with critical comments, of course, where necessary. Once again, my warmest thanks to the Czech Senate, the Czech Parliament and the Czech Government.	
en.20090715.10.3-144.wav	Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, last week – to my great pleasure as a new Member – in a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee we heard a talk by Mr Makhmalbaf, an Iranian film director, who told us very plainly that before this election Iran had 20% democracy, but after the election, which in his opinion was a sham, there was absolutely no democracy left. I also agree with this description – it most certainly was a sham election, which, with large-scale electoral fraud, robbed the majority of Iranian people, who had called for change, of this right. President-in-Office of the Council there is one thing in particular that interests me: in the middle of August the inauguration of the ‘ re-elected ’ Mr Ahmadinejad will take place. What is currently being discussed in the Council and also in the Member States? Will the European Union and the Member States be officially represented at this inauguration? I certainly hope not, as I do not think that there should be any official representation of the European Union or the Member States after this election sham, and as much as I would advocate further dialogue, no one should officially represent the European Union at this inauguration. What is your position on this? How is it currently being dealt with?	
en.20090915.18.2-175.wav	Mr President, the depth of the crisis in Europe was caused not simply by unethical behaviour on the financial markets, Mr Barroso. Other causes include growing social inequality, dangerous macro-economic imbalances between the Member States, which led to a lack of solidarity, and Europe ’ s dependency on rising resource prices. The citizens of Europe deserve a Commission which repeatedly puts these deeper causes back on the agenda instead of turning them into taboos, instead of doing the opposite and instead of shifting the responsibility on to the Member States. We need properly coordinated economic and fiscal policies in Europe. We need collaboration on tax in Europe, which will put an end to tax dumping. Only then will it be possible to stop the spread of social divisions and to finance the environmentally friendly investments that are needed. We need a policy which consistently promotes green technologies and lifestyles in order to bring about a rapid reduction in the EU ’ s dependence on finite resources. This will represent a green environmental revolution. I cannot find any of these things in your programme, Mr Barroso, which is why I cannot vote for you.	
en.20090915.18.2-180.wav	Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy. Mr Barroso, just imagine you were to stand for election in Europe, just you and no other candidate. What percentage of the votes would you receive? What would the citizens do? They would probably have listened to you today and seen that you promised everything to everyone. Hopefully, they would also find out what you did five years ago. That was when you promised most people a very great deal. It is a question of comparing what you promised then with what you are promising now and with what can be expected. I believe that is very, very little. You represent the old Europe, the botched Europe, the contribution to the financial crisis, as a result of the failure on the part of the Commission, the lack of commitment to climate issues, and so on and so forth. I would be on the side of the majority of European citizens, because I believe that you would not get more than 10 or 12 or 15% of the votes.	
en.20091111.12.3-028.wav	Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of retaining the new proposal, because, at the end of the day, it is clear that the negotiations in Honduras have failed. There is no joint proposal for this election. The election is illegitimate, because the incumbent president came to power as a result of a. I therefore urge this House to agree to the suggestion from the Bureau to remove the elections.	
en.20091111.13.3-044.wav	Mr President, democracy needs a revolution, and it is never wrong, Mr Dartmouth, to speak out in favour of transparency, Mr Verhofstadt. You in particular, in the Swedish Presidency, could be a shining example of this and actually tell us what is going on in the horse trading for the top posts that is completely unworthy of the European Project and also – Mr Barroso could lead the way on this – with regard to the appointment of the commissioners. Germany and Austria are a poor example in this regard, but so, unfortunately, are others. There are qualified people sitting in this Chamber, but they have no chance of being accepted. Please, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has been adopted, be courageous and honest and admit that we need much clearer, transparent decision-making structures for the Commission and for the top posts. With so much expertise, it has to be possible to find good people in the European Parliament rather than gathering them from some province or other.	
en.20091111.21.3-265.wav	Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament ’ s agenda many times. It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. That has been said a couple of times already. Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament. In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU. On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request. It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail. As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests. Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered? If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered? My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests?	
en.20091124.32.2-297.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will not be giving the resolution its backing. The Stockholm Programme completely fails to address the real challenges of the present day. Its main error is that a Europe of rights is being created to which EU citizens will be granted access but others who live in Europe will not. These other people will not be entitled to the same human and civil rights. The EU wants to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights – something that we welcome – yet, at the same time, migrants are to be separated out according to the ‘ legal or illegal ’ principle. Frontex is therefore being tooled up to wage war on so-called illegal migration, completely obscuring the idea of an unprejudiced immigration policy from view. This is where Stockholm fails. Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security. It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom. Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being. Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU ’ s manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control, which will then mix intelligence service and police data on a pan-European basis. This will mean the shredding of people ’ s right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality. Allow me, as an MEP from eastern Germany, to conclude by observing that I find it insufferable, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Europe is coming more and more to resemble a fortress.	
en.20091124.38.2-483.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, you are right, the railway system is a very safe system when compared to other forms of transport. Alongside many positive elements, however, liberalisation has also brought with it a degree of poorer safety in the form of the fragmentation of individual companies, the separation of infrastructure and operations, the outsourcing of maintenance work and the leasing of materials and staff. In my opinion, it must be ensured that the national safety authorities issue their safety certificates and authorisations in accordance with what is laid down by the European Railway Agency (ERA). Are there adequate controls? Is it ensured, for example, that the training of the staff, the certifications and the working conditions are properly monitored? What is the situation, in this regard, with respect to the introduction of a standardised Community certification? What is the situation with regard to the European train driver ’ s licence? The efforts with regard to the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) must also be redoubled. The recent implementation plan that you referred to must be binding and must not be delayed due to financial or national considerations. The efforts relating to the introduction of the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) must be continued and extended. This would represent huge progress, particularly in terms of the standardisation of materials, and would provide a higher degree of safety in relation to material maintenance. Many of the most recent railway accidents and near-misses have been due to maintenance failings. The intensity, in particular, is being neglected on cost grounds, and maintenance intervals are being lengthened. What is the situation with regard to a Europe-wide certification system for maintenance works? I believe that everything possible must be done to prevent each individual Member State from turning back to its old rules and acting independently and in diverging ways. The border crossings between the individual Member States, in particular, represent a safety risk. How does the Commission intend to overcome this problem in the short term? I would also like to ask you to ensure that, when you make your evaluation, you do not forget the social aspects – they need to be taken into account.	
en.20091126.3.4-030.wav	We need a revolution in democracy! Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to the new world of the Treaty of Lisbon. This represents an opportunity for you. For 11 years, I have been following your reports in this House, and before that as a journalist, and when it comes down to it, they are all very similar. However, now you have the opportunity to look to the future. Make use of the professional competence of this House – we are not gathered here today just by chance in this Chamber; I can see Mr Søndergaard and Mr Chatzimarkakis, Mr Staes and on our side, my fellow-combatant Mr Ehrenhauser – and restructure the work of the Court of Auditors. Take a look at what works elsewhere, for example in Germany, where it is possible to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and meaningfulness of expenditure, and in Austria, and develop a concept, perhaps as part of an initiative report from Parliament, which describes how the things that you do can be done much better, so that you can genuinely fulfil your obligations.	
en.20091214.16.1-124.wav	Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy. I recall very clearly that the debates that we are hearing today started ten years ago in this House. I would appeal to you, Commissioner, to take particular account of what Mr Désir has said, but also of what the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and some of the Members on the left have said. Do you not see that, with the approach with which the European Union has entered the negotiations, we cannot, as honest brokers, overcome the imbalance in relation to what we are currently seeing in Copenhagen, and that in reality, we need a new approach? In much of what they are doing today, the developing countries are no longer developing countries. They are emerging economies, industrialised countries and very self-aware. If we, in Europe, do not succeed in daring to start anew with fair requirements, then we will end up exactly where we do not want to be, namely with protectionism and with a repeat of 1933 and subsequent years in Europe.	
en.20091214.17.1-147.wav	Madam President, I would like to use the blue card simply to rectify one point. The support in Austria is not being granted to just one person.	
en.20091214.18.1-168.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a microfinance instrument for the unemployed, those at risk of becoming unemployed and, above all, for people who do not have access to normal credit markets, is evidence of good intentions and is, in principle, something that our group supports. However, what the Commission and the Council have so far achieved in this process is quite simply inadequate and, in some respects, wrong, and our group is not able to support it. Our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation. What is on the table in terms of total appropriation is not appropriate for a programme for combating unemployment and can hardly be termed a microfinance programme – at best, it is a nanofinance programme! Secondly, we are, as a matter of principle, opposed to these types of conjuring tricks which do not have the slightest effect and which are financed at the expense of other programmes and therefore simply fizzle out. Thirdly, we are of the opinion that mentoring and coaching are absolutely essential in order for such a programme to succeed and be sustainable. Many new business start-ups fail, in particular, in the microfinance sector, and so this must be accounted for within the programme. Fourthly, it must be ensured that social security payments in the Member States are not cancelled if someone takes advantage of this programme, otherwise it will have no effect. Unemployment cannot be lastingly combated in this way. In this form, we will reject this programme.	
en.20091216.14.3-166.wav	Madam President, today, after eight years, we all essentially know that the previous Afghanistan strategy based on military force has failed. The imbalance between military operations, on the one hand, and the insufficient resources for civil purposes, on the other, is directly preventing any improvement in the living conditions in Afghanistan. Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy. We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy. Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education. The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here. This, of course, includes increasing good governance, strengthening agriculture and integrating former Taliban fighters. However, I say this to you most sincerely: if we only go half way to doing this and once again rely on military force, we will squander our chances. Time is running out!	
en.20091216.17.3-261.wav	My question is this: would it not be sensible to prevent unemployment in the first place? Do you see any public jobs that could be given to the unemployed? In particular, how could we boost small and medium-sized enterprises so that new ones are started up? Are there opportunities here to apply cross-border methods and best practices to create more new companies?	
en.20091216.3.3-044.wav	Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy. That fact that I admire so many Swedish traditions made me all the more disappointed by the overall balance sheet of their activities. Unfortunately, it was not a presidency of the people, but rather a presidency of the Council and also a large-scale investor presidency in the style of Mrs Wallström rather than that of Mrs Malmström. Mrs Malmström, I remember you well from the time you were an MEP here. During this presidency, you have been a rather different person. I very much hope that when you return, you will pick up where you left off when you were here, namely being inspired by the parliamentary system. Why did you adopt SWIFT at such a late stage? Why do we now have a kind of executive board at EU level – this being one of the objectives of the Swedes, of all people, with their transparency? Please use your future to return to your roots.	
en.20091217.3.4-046.wav	Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union. The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission ’ s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased. In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised. The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions. Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis. I would like to say one last word about the border regions. As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there. I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect.	
en.20091217.3.4-057.wav	Mr President, the regional structural funding is an important tool for European integration and the Objective 2 funding in particular has, in the past, been seen as an engine for local structural and economic development by the people in many regions. It is an important means of managing structural change in the regions and in local authority areas. This allows citizens to experience Europe at first hand, because the funding has a local impact. However, we need simpler, clearer and more transparent structures and better controls in the cohesion funds, so that the money is used sustainably and efficiently. Cohesion, or the convergence of social and economic development, is a major objective of the EU and, therefore, it is important that this instrument is strengthened rather than weakened in future. The cohesion policy in Europe needs more clarity, more transparency and more efficiency. The individual Member States must also take more responsibility in this area. This is why it is important to retain the system of additionality in funding. We do not want structural funding to be renationalised. Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission to meet these requirements in the funding criteria for 2013.	
en.20091217.4.4-080.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise two points of order and I would like to be able to raise them one after another. Firstly, I have a request for the entire House. It refers to an urgent matter which we will be discussing this afternoon. This is the case of Aminatou Haidar. We have an urgent matter on the agenda this afternoon. I would ask my fellow Members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process. Some Members who have been closely involved with this case know – and I cannot give any more details at this point, but I am one of those who knows – that we will have a solution for this case during the course of the day. Prominent government representatives from the EU are working to achieve a positive solution. Therefore, it would be sensible to remove this urgent matter from the agenda this afternoon, because any further debate would only hinder the work which is being done through diplomatic channels. This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case, we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda, because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be. That was my first request, Mr President. The second request will follow immediately.	
en.20100119.6.2-096.wav	Madam President, it seems to me to be a little symptomatic for the EU in general, but also for Parliament in particular, that we should have knee-jerk debates about situations in certain countries that are in no way new. Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious. I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aeroplane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen. We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation. I also think that the situation in Yemen requires a precise analysis, specifically with regard to the fact that this is a failed state in which the government does not have control of large parts of the country We should analyse for ourselves what risks this involves for Europe. The risks appear to be that terrorists are trained there and the risks also appear to relate to the Yemeni coast, where piracy is clearly taking place. We – and perhaps Baroness Ashton, also – must consider what we can do to counter these risks. As I see it, the main question might well be: how can we bolster the Yemeni Government so that it can regain control of the country and thus contain these risks? All the other debates about the long-term building-up of the country also need to be held, of course, but I do not think that there is really any point in us putting forward a catalogue of demands clean across all political areas – from the freedom of the media to women ’ s rights – here in Parliament at this point, or that we will be taken seriously if we do so. Doing so will not achieve our goal in Yemen, so instead, we should concentrate on what tangible assistance we can provide in the current situation in order to solve an urgent problem.	
en.20100121.6.4-085.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre on 23 November of last year in the Province of Maguindanao in the Philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism. Fifty seven people were killed, women were raped, people were injured – they convey a bloody message. As a journalist, it struck me, in particular, that there were 30 journalists among those killed. According to the renowned International Crisis Group, in no other case on record have more journalists ever been murdered at one time. For this reason, it is appropriate for the European Parliament to make a clear statement, as we are doing today in this draft resolution. However, as the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats), we request that the present text be toned down in three places through a split vote, because we ought to support the Philippine Government in its fight against terrorism and violence and therefore dispense with overly accusatory remarks directed at the government. Therefore, on behalf of the PPE Group, I request a separate vote on recital F. This accuses the Philippines of showing all the signs of a non-functional legal system. In paragraph 2, we would like to delete the insinuation about what are referred to as initial delays in the investigation. Finally, in paragraph 6, it is claimed that some missing persons are locked away in Philippine prisons. This, too, is currently an unproven insinuation and should, in our opinion, be deleted.	
en.20100224.12.3-024.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is good that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are looking at this in detail. However, I would like to say that Parliament adopted a resolution almost unanimously in December 2008 in which we called on the European Commission to submit precisely the sort of proposal that we are now discussing. Parliament must also stick to what it has itself decided and what has been the declared intention of this House for years. Because it is only natural for there to be concerns about one thing or another in connection with any legislative proposal, we have resolved the open questions by means of a compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs. I should make it clear that this compromise is ready for approval. Nevertheless, I do understand that it might make sense to enlarge the group that are in support of this report a bit more. If the efforts of Mr Schulz are aimed at increasing the number of supporters, then I have nothing against a postponement until the next plenary sitting in March. That is my personal opinion on the matter. It is not the opinion of the group, which expressly decided otherwise this morning. However, I think we should give the Socialists a chance to reach a conclusion so that they too can do something to help reduce bureaucracy and the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.	
en.20100309.21.2-232.wav	I understand. Mr Almunia was the competent Commissioner. However, I was asking about interventions on your part, so could you just tell us once again what you did yourself? Have I understood you correctly, Mr Barroso, that the blame for the Greek crisis lies with the Member States, because they refused to follow your proposals? Could you please tell us which Heads of Government of which Member States we are talking about?	
en.20100309.22.2-308.wav	I wish you a very warm welcome to this House. The loss of confidence in Copenhagen was, in my opinion, one of the major problems. This could theoretically continue worldwide, but also within the European Union. My question to you is as follows. What is happening with the instruments that we adopted last year? The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is of concern to me, because I am not entirely sure what the Commission is currently doing in light of the decision in Copenhagen, for example, with regard to benchmarks, but also to carbon leakage. My second question is as follows. The French Government has put forward a proposal to incorporate importers from developing countries into the ETS system in order to make the market bigger and to allow these countries to participate in this system. Do you have an opinion on this?	
en.20100310.22.3-349.wav	Madam President, it is a question of us, as the European Union, following a clear strategy and preventing a gold or gemstone rush. Europe must actively involve itself here. Europe, as a partner, can show strength here by speaking with one voice. This relates to shipping on and below the water, fisheries, resources in the form of primary energy carriers and raw materials. In this connection, we need stable and dependable treaties with the other partners in the Arctic. We need cooperation, not confrontation. We need dialogue in the field of environmental protection in order to conserve natural resources and nature. We need dialogue in the field of animal protection in order to conserve the biodiversity, and we need protection and respect for the local inhabitants and their human rights. If we can implement positive resource management together with our partners in the Arctic, we will have the opportunity to take new political roads here, and it will also be a first acid test for our common foreign policy – a chance to prove that we, as Europeans, can indeed pursue objectives together.	
en.20100324.19.3-282.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model. It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority. I therefore call on Europe ’ s labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time work to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures. That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty. Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe ’ s labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner.	
en.20100419.18.1-124.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Leichtfried for an excellent report which contains good, sustainable proposals. What, in the end, is the issue here? It is about strengthening transparency, consumer protection, security and coordination, as well as quality control. I would, however, advise against creating a new authority to deal with these questions. I take a positive view of the subsidiarity in the report, and it should definitely be retained. It is also very important for me that there should be a clear separation between taxes and charges, and all government tasks – whether fingerprinting and photographing, police tasks, fighting terrorism or something similar – must clearly be financed through taxation and not through consumer charges. If individual states then have a vital interest in taking security measures that go beyond this, then I think that, in this area, they also have the duty to bear the costs. Whoever orders government-related security measures also pays for them. I think it is different in the case of technical or personal security, which can certainly be passed on to the passenger, as long as its purpose is clearly declared. It is worth noting, though, that in the impact assessment that the Commission has put before us, we are talking about a sum of around 0.1% of the total fare for these measures. We should therefore not start too high. I believe that we are bringing about a sustainable compromise, including with the Federal Republic of Germany, which has considerable reservations here in the area of subsidiarity. I would hope that the end result is very close to our proposal.	
en.20100421.6.3-134.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, with the analysis of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, as with SWIFT, an attempt is being made to reconcile the fight against global terrorism and serious crime with the fundamental rights of all to the protection of privacy and information self-determination. We must also be aware, however, that in this age of mobility, there cannot be adequate security in Europe and worldwide without effective and rapid data exchange. In the digital age, we also have to ensure special protection as regards information self-determination and privacy. I therefore also consider it essential to make a more exact distinction between data needed to fight crime and sensitive private data. For me, there is no doubt that we must firmly integrate controls, the right of appeal, access rights, claims for damages, as well as the length of the retention period, in the agreement. Using the push method, it should be checked whether there can or need to be exceptions in urgent cases. As regards the use of PNR data, we should also include serious crime. To me, that includes offences like child pornography, people trafficking, murder, rape and also drug trafficking. In my opinion, this would also contribute to protecting the personal rights of those affected. I think it is good that we are taking a decision on the agreement on PNR data, in order to develop a basic model for all future agreements of this sort and to recommend a negotiating framework to the Commission, so that it takes into account our own ideas on data protection. Perhaps in future, there will also be room to consider combating terrorism and crime together with our transatlantic partners in a joint institution. That would certainly also be a step towards confronting globalised crime on a global scale.	
en.20100506.3.4-027.wav	Mr President, the previous speakers have rightly highlighted the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB). Mrs Kadenbach, for example, has referred to its essential contribution to social convergence. I would like to put that in a political context. We are very concerned to see that parties of the extreme right are gaining popularity in more and more countries. This is because social convergence in the European Union is not working in the way in which we would all have liked. These radical right-wingers are very often wolves in sheep ’ s clothing, which allows them to conceal their massive and cynical contempt for humanity. My final example, Mr President – and I am aware of your political leanings – concerns what Mr Mölzer has just done. He has made a nice little speech, but in the meantime he has called one of his political opponents – in other words, me – a psychopath. That is the language of Hitler ’ s fascism. This is the way in which these people work, by branding their political opponents as monsters. I would like to ask you to take the necessary measures and I would also like to ask the staff of the EIB to continue with their work, in particular in the area of transparency. They should make what they do even more transparent, because this approach will help to combat the new rise of fascism.	
en.20100517.19.1-186.wav	Mr President, Policy Coherence for Development means not giving with one hand and taking away with the other. It makes no sense, for example, to provide funding to support agriculture in developing countries if, at the same time, we destroy the local markets through direct or indirect export subsidies. Similarly, we may be continuing with great efforts to promote health provision yet, at the same time, we are preventing the trade in generic medicines or pushing up the prices of medicines to prohibitive levels by extending patent protection. Agrofuels may possibly reduce CO emissions in the EU a little, but result in deforestation and land grabbing in developing countries, thereby leading to more climate change – which is precisely what we wanted to avoid, not to mention the displacement of indigenous populations and the loss of biodiversity and farm land for growing food. At the moment, we – that is, the EU are not particularly coherent. The EU has long recognised in theory that political measures must not be contradictory. Policy Coherence for Development is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Article 208 states: ‘ The Union shall take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries. ’ Let us be judged by this requirement. This year, we are reviewing the progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. It is obvious that we will not be able to keep our promises unless our policies are coherent. We – all of us that adopt and transpose legislation – need to be aware of this responsibility. Before we decide on a measure, we need to assess the consequences, so that we can recognise the negative effects that European legislation may have on developing countries. We need expertise in the Council, the Commission and in Parliament that can recognise incoherent aspects. The Commission ’ s work programme on policy coherence is a good step in this direction. It is now a matter of how this plan is implemented. Policy Coherence for Development means giving greater consideration to the interests of local people in our reform of fisheries policy and not allowing these interests to be subsumed by the interests of European fisheries concerns. It means that we must dry up streams of money that flow from developing countries into tax havens. It means that we cannot adopt ACTA if there remains a suspicion that this agreement could disrupt the supply of medicines or technologies in developing countries. So far, the Commission has not been able to eliminate this suspicion. Policy coherence also means that development policy must remain a strong, independent policy area in the creation of the European External Action Service and that the field of competence of the Commissioner for Development must be expanded, not restricted. It also includes allowing municipalities to take fair trade, for example, into consideration as a procurement criterion, as proposed by Mrs Rühle. In many cases, we Members of Parliament need to keep a close eye on the Commission and the Council to ensure that policies are coherent. In many cases, however, it is up to us – the Members of Parliament – to provide coherence for development. We need the committees to be more joined up and we need a permanent rapporteur. The report – which was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Development – contains many good proposals and takes us a good step forward. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, the ombudsman and all the NGOs for their cooperation and assistance, and I hope that our joint report will be able to be adopted in plenary tomorrow.	
en.20100519.14.3-126.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see from the voting list that you, Mr President, intend to declare Amendment 2 inadmissible. I would like to ask you to reconsider this. It is correct that Article 229 of the treaty requires a session of the European Parliament to take place on the second Tuesday in March. However, this does not conflict with the amendment tabled by my group. My group ’ s amendment aims to move the Strasbourg week from week 10 to week 11. That does not prevent you from holding a plenary session on the second Tuesday in March. We want the Strasbourg week to be week 11, but this does not mean that our amendment is inadmissible. I would like to ask you to reconsider this.	
en.20100615.27.2-391.wav	Mr President, Mr Barroso, following on from the questions put by my fellow Member, Mr Weber, did Commissioner Malmström inform the College that there are great concerns in this House regarding the current state of negotiations? Is the Commission aware that what it has resolved today is undoubtedly not what Parliament considers to be sufficient progress? Do you realise, Mr President, that you have adopted something today that, if implemented in this way, will result in people employed by private companies such as Swift having greater rights of control than officials of the European Union? Did Mrs Malmström explain this to you? If so, how could you have decided this? If not, why did Mrs Malmström not make you aware of it?	
en.20100615.27.2-393.wav	Mr President, Mr Barroso, thank you for your kind descriptions of your debate. It did not answer my question, however. I will therefore try to be more precise this time, and I would ask you to be very precise in your answer. Did Mrs Malmström tell you during the debate in the Commission before the College made its decision that there was a risk that Parliament would reject the text that you are now presenting as an agreement? Or did Mrs Malmström say to you: ‘ We will get a parliamentary majority with this text ’? Let me repeat my question very precisely. Did Mrs Malmström say: ‘ We will get a parliamentary majority for this text ’ or did she say: ‘ With this text it is uncertain whether we will get a parliamentary majority ’? I would be grateful if you could answer precisely.	
en.20100615.4.2-025.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months. I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense. The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes. Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become – how riddled it is with lies and half-truths? What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers. However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours. That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment. It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard. It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work. As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers! We cannot pass laws on the basis of ‘ Let ’ s see what happens ’. Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious. My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads? Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence. Let us abandon this nonsense. This is about fair competition. It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours. Do not play games like that with this House!	
en.20100615.4.2-038.wav	Madam President, just as I have done for many years, I am today working for road safety, for an improvement in working conditions for professional drivers, and for an improvement in their professional image. It is obvious that what we are debating today is not the provisions on driving hours and rest times, which impact on road safety and are applicable to all professional drivers, be they employed or self-employed; rather, it is about the regulation of working hours. It is primarily a regulation for the protection of employees – in other words, it is solely for the social protection of drivers and in no way serves road safety. There is no need to protect the self-employed from themselves. How would we check the hours worked by self-employed HGV and bus drivers without a huge amount of bureaucracy, and on what basis would we be checking this anyway? Restricting the permissible working hours of self-employed professional drivers in this way – and perhaps, in future, also those of self-employed tradesmen, architects or Members of Parliament – would send out the wrong signal. Instead, the Member States should be working to combat the problem of ostensible self-employment among drivers. I am in favour of the proposal put by the European Commission and Mrs Bauer.	
en.20100616.30.3-478.wav	Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also our shadow rapporteur. They have produced a good report. The most important point for me is that both sides which are currently making life difficult in Bosnia and Herzegovina have come to their senses and are retreating from their extreme positions. One of these extreme positions involves constantly calling Bosnia and its integrity into question and threatening to hold referendums which will have no impact except to stir up public opinion and generate hatred. The other extreme position is to call into question the basic structure of Dayton. Does the Dayton Agreement need to be adapted? Yes. It has already been modified, but more work needs to be done. One side is constantly saying that the office of the High Representative must be abolished and I agree with this. However, the side that is calling for that to happen must prepare the ground for the politicians in the country to be able to take on the responsibility themselves. This must be our objective, but the politicians must also play their part. In addition, at the next election, the voters will hopefully elect politicians who are prepared to be responsible for their own country.	
en.20100616.34.3-540.wav	Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, only a few days ago, we saw the shocking images on the television of huge areas of Poland and other Central European countries under the flood waters. People have died in these floods and our sympathy goes out to their relatives and friends. Villages, towns, agricultural land and infrastructure have all been destroyed. The television pictures have already been replaced by other images, but the extensive damage now has to be slowly and laboriously repaired. These countries should have the solidarity of the other countries in the European Union behind them during the work on repairing damage on this scale. Following the flood disaster of 1997, Poland and other Central European countries have once again been hit by devastating floods. We cannot control the weather and it is in the nature of rivers to flood at certain times. However, the questions that we have to ask are whether, given that natural disasters can happen at any time, the right measures have been taken to prevent the damage caused by natural phenomena of this kind and whether, for example, sufficient attention has been paid to issues of sustainable disaster prevention during the landscape planning process. If we are to provide aid, we must ensure firstly that it goes to those directly affected by the natural disaster in order to safeguard their livelihoods. Then it is a question of the Member States working together, because natural disasters do not stop at national borders, with coordination on a European level to do more to prevent the damage caused by disasters of this kind. The flood protection system on the River Oder, which has been built jointly by the Polish and German authorities, is a clear indication that joint prevention measures can provide real protection. However, we have still not done enough. We do not need a European disaster prevention programme. The government of each country should take primary responsibility for protecting that country against disasters, including drawing up disaster plans. However, in the case of a disaster and when damage has been caused, the aid provided can effectively be coordinated at a European level and the voluntary organisations which provide aid should have their expenses reimbursed quickly and without red tape. Therefore, I support Mrs Georgieva ’ s plans, which will allow us to turn these aims into reality quickly.	
en.20100616.4.3-027.wav	Madam President, unfortunately, my painful illness has so far prevented me from speaking out as clearly to our international audience as I have done in the past on other European topics. I have one minute, Mr Barroso. This is an historic period for you. As far as the financial markets are concerned, you will be measured on whether you succeed in resolving one of the most urgent issues, in other words, introducing regulations which actually close the loopholes. As things currently stand, everything that we hear from the Commission and that has so far been said in Parliament does not preclude that from happening. If none of the necessary improvements are made, you will go down in history as someone who watched the house burning down and made no attempt to find anything to put the fire out or even any new building materials. My second point concerns capital. If you do not succeed in abolishing this disastrous, devastating system of conduit banks, rather than just keeping it in check, you will be depriving the real economy and billions of people throughout the world not only of their own economic basis for action, but also their confidence in everything which we call democracy. This will mean that China and the totalitarian states, which are making sure that their banks are under control, will suddenly be in a better position than the European Union. My third point is that, of course, we need a system which keeps systemic risks to a minimum. The ‘ too big to fail ’ issue can be resolved with progressive tax regulations which will require a bank simply to close when it gets too big.	
en.20100617.33.4-303.wav	Mr President, in 2007 and 2008, Libya voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, and the repeated questioning by human rights organisations elicited no official statements either. It is therefore very important to us that the names of the people who have been executed are now officially revealed at last. Any execution is one too many. We condemn the use of executions and the death penalty. They are inhumane and cruel, and any execution is one too many. In our resolution, therefore, we clearly ask that we change this situation and bring it to light and that we now work together to bring about a change here. No more underreporting. Instead we want transparent information on what happens here and a humane penalty for genuine criminals, but no excessive punishment for those who criticise the regime in Tripoli.	
en.20100705.14.1-021.wav	Mr President, I would like to express my group ’ s support for Mr Cohn-Bendit ’ s motion. Our view of the situation is exactly the same. This is a highly sensitive and very delicate subject and it certainly makes sense for it to have a broad parliamentary majority. Therefore, it would be a good idea to postpone the report and to attempt to reach a consensus in various areas where this is still possible. This is why we are supporting this motion.	
en.20100705.15.1-041.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, given the small amount of time available, I will restrict myself to discussing the Cancian report. No one disputes the fact that people travelling on buses and coaches must have passenger rights and, therefore, consumer rights. However, I would like to emphasise once again the problems that will result for small and medium-sized operators at the moment, in particular, in Germany. It is not possible to separate local and regional public transport facilities in Germany, especially in rural areas, as they often jointly provide services covering a radius of around 50 km. My second point is that small and medium-sized operators will not be able to make advance compensation payments regardless of fault. Until now, the principle of legal liability has proved its worth and has resulted in stable ticket prices. Thirdly, I do not believe that operators should pay for delays that are not their fault, just as liability should only apply in circumstances for which operators are responsible.	
en.20100705.18.1-116.wav	Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Grosch for his in-depth report and for the huge amount of work that he has put into it. Without a functioning transport system, a Europe without frontiers that separate us will not be possible. In addition, the European economy cannot be successful and is not even conceivable without efficient, future-proof transport systems on land, on water and in the air. We need a stronger sense of community and less national egoism, in particular, when it comes to environmentally friendly rail transport. In order to ensure that transport has a sustainable future, all the modes of transport must be prepared to take up the environmental and economic challenges faced by society as a whole. The report provides valuable pointers in this respect, which indicate the direction that we must move in. There is only one point on which I do not agree with the report. Establishing a transport fund using cohesion policy money is not something that I can support. Why is that? It is true that transport promotes cohesion in Europe. However, a separate fund financed with cohesion policy money would not be able to fulfil the expectations that it would give rise to. It would also apply one-sided pressure on the Cohesion Fund and take too much responsibility away from the Member States, which are specifically required to ensure a sustainable future for transport. We have just established a special committee in Parliament which will discuss what the European Union Cohesion and Structural Funds will look like in future and we should not prejudge this committee ’ s work. Therefore, I am calling on you to vote in favour of the amendment to this report. In addition, I believe that in the context of sustainability and the future of transport systems, we should also give magnetic levitation technology a chance.	
en.20100706.28.2-388.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we may have a single internal market, but we have a fragmented supervisory body. It is obvious that this cannot work. We need strong central European structures which utilise the expertise and in-depth knowledge of the Member States ’ agencies, while also having intervention powers to be used in emergencies. If only in light of the huge tax burden imposed on them by this crisis, citizens are expecting a quick, sound decision to be made in this House without delay. If there are power games being played at national level merely as to who decides what, this is of little interest to citizens. What citizens want is for an effective decision to be made to get problems resolved. Objectively speaking, if measures are required in an emergency, they must be dealt with and a decision made centrally at European level if coordination between Member States is inadequate and does not work. This is the line taken for decisions made by the G20 and G8, as well as by Heads of State or Government, but unfortunately, this is not the case at Council level. The Council only takes a narrow-minded approach. The public do not find this policy acceptable. We expect the Council to take action.	
en.20100706.28.2-394.wav	Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one could wonder what we have actually now achieved after a year spent in discussions, debates and many sessions in the trialogue, and I could have certainly imagined doing something nicer than spending my time there. One year on from the European elections, when we announced in public how we wanted to bring the finance markets into line, we are now at a point where our success rate ranges from very little to none at all. The problem has already been explained. We are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays. Member States still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment. The fact that this did not work was not what actually triggered the financial crisis, but it contributed to Europe being affected by it as well. This is why I would ask when this realisation, which is often mentioned in grandiose speeches, will be converted into political action, where it is suddenly about protecting stock exchange centres and banking structures and no longer about protecting citizens. This is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the European Parliament. I hope that Member States will commit themselves to this task, too, because we share the responsibility for implementing proper supervision regulations for citizens, which will ensure that individuals ’ savings are also permanently secure. I would of course hope – and I am now addressing the Commissioners – that every effort will now be made by the Commission so that we can achieve a good outcome as quickly as possible, for the benefit of people living in Europe.	
en.20100706.28.2-399.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the responsibility in this European Parliament to regulate the financial markets firmly. All the proposals we have made were strongly watered down in the trialogues. The Council and the governments do not want strong intervention rights. Mr Giegold is right when he described what is currently going on as ‘ parochial ’. The intention seems to be not to tighten the regulations, but simply to design a system which is slightly less prone to breaking down. We will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets. Inadequate conclusions are being drawn from this financial and economic crisis, which means that the next crisis is already brewing. Many national economies, including those in Europe, will not withstand the blows to come, with all the social and economic repercussions this entails for people living in Europe. They are expecting this predatory financial market capitalism to be tamed and the dominance of politics to be restored. If the CEO of UniCredit Bank, Alessandro Profumo, says as he did at the weekend that we need a strong, uniform European Financial Supervisory Authority and a common set of rules for all Member States, calling for tighter capital rules, this is an appeal to this Parliament to actually draw up these rules. It is this European Parliament ’ s job to exert pressure on the Council and enforce effective regulation as a matter of urgency. This would be just the first step to a. It is finally time for the grandiose promises to be backed up by actions. My group supports strong European regulation. Any other situation, without regulations, would pose a danger to the euro, a single EU and democracy.	
en.20100706.33.2-578.wav	Mr President, this debate was timed badly. I would like to have seen the Dutch team win, even if for the last time in this World Cup. This is perhaps a bad omen, because we are no longer allowed to watch, so they will probably not win after all. Commissioner, today – or more precisely tomorrow – we are completing a legislative package that we have been discussing for more than two years. It is not just controversy that is responsible for this, but also the European elections that have taken place in the meantime, and also the entry into force of a new EU Treaty which has meant that we have had to adjust a few things. However, I think that, if we can draw a conclusion from today ’ s debate, it is that we are voting on a compromise which completely deserves to be approved, even if, in some areas, we might do so with gritted teeth. I would like to emphasise two aspects. The first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants. What we are talking about here is the better implementation of best available techniques in Europe. I think that we have found a paragraph of exceptions in the compromise which is currently before us which gives the European Commission – Mr Potočnik, here I am addressing you directly – the tools to ensure over the next few years, better and more firmly than has been the case up to now, that the approximately 52 000 industrial plants in Europe which are affected by this finally make better use of best available techniques than they currently do. I have heard many arguments in this debate. I would like to take up one of these and deflect it, because I cannot comprehend it at all. It has often been said to me that the use of best available techniques is too expensive and that we will thereby endanger the competitiveness of European industry, and even more so in the crisis. I do not like to remember my past, but I come from the former GDR, East Germany. The economic and ecological collapse of the GDR was attributable to the fact that for decades, we neglected to invest in up-to-date technology. I think that every industry and every industrial enterprise, for its existence, needs to invest in up-to-date technology, because otherwise it will become less competitive, and this naturally means also reducing emissions of pollutants. Today, we have the opportunity to bring in a law which will improve this situation from which we are starting. The second part of the directive – and here we have some of the gritted teeth that I mentioned – deals with large combustion plants. We are talking once more – as we did before with the last directive – about renewing exceptions up to 2020, and in some cases 2023, for large combustion plants which do not have to achieve the environmental obligations and, in particular, the limits on air pollutants. Here I call on the Council, but also perhaps all of us here, to consider very carefully how sensible it really is that we regularly bring in ambitious environmental targets, and we discuss them and welcome them here, but always, whenever it comes to implementing them and transforming them into concrete legislation, then a tragedy begins in Europe. Then it suddenly becomes clear to the Member States how much it costs, which bills we have to pay, and then, as a rule, the ones who have done this in advance are punished. There are a number of Member States which now already meet the obligations, and which will, in the end, be left out in the cold. I will say it here once again: whether we are talking about industrial plants or large combustion plants – which essentially means coal power stations – we are not dealing with science fiction. We are not talking about things which are not available; on the contrary, this is up-to-date technology. Best available techniques – what is available on the market given competitive and cost factors – can be incorporated into these plants, and today, against this background, we are completing a legislative package which I think is better than what is currently in force, and therefore I would encourage us all to approve it. I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who, while sometimes pulling no punches, have worked with me on this for the last two years, for their support, their legwork and, above all, for the fact that almost all of the main groups have subscribed to this compromise.	
en.20100706.33.2-603.wav	Mr President, three relevant things have happened while we have been debating: first, it is clear that Europe will be the football world champions. A good omen, I think. Who exactly it will be, we will see. I do not want to express any preference now. The second is that Germany is receiving compliments from the United Kingdom. Chris Davies, many thanks! That also does not happen every day. It is certainly worth noting. Thirdly, all is still well with the world; even the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance finds football more important than environmental protection. Regrettably, our fellow Member, Mr Eickhout, has left us again. However, congratulations to our Dutch friends, of course. I wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen. The first is that I understand all the worries and woes of my Eastern European friends only too well. As an East German, I am also half-Eastern European. I understand that Eastern Europe cannot immediately catch up on every step of environmental policy that has been taken in the Western European countries in recent decades. In order to get high-level environmental protection, one has to be able to afford it. Yes, that is true. However, I think that – even if we allow for this – it is worth approving this compromise, because it will do justice to the different starting positions that many Member States find themselves in. Secondly, the argument that the use of best available techniques will endanger competitiveness, in particular, with respect to China, is not only false; it is also dangerous. We must deal with the fact that industrial processes in Asia are always cheaper than here. However, we will only meet this challenge if we implement best available techniques in as many branches of industry as possible. Those which do not do this will become less competitive. No one, including this law, is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow. No one is demanding a leap from 0 to 100 in order to achieve a particular pollutant limit within a week. We have enough transitional periods, but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false. I also think that with this directive, we have set a course not only for environmental policy, but also for industrial policy, a course for which it is worth working in the next few years.	
en.20100707.27.3-382.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking all my fellow Members from the other political groups who worked with me on this report on Kosovo, as well as Mrs Mahr, who did some very valuable work here in the Secretariat. I would also like to thank you, Commissioner, for your positive cooperation, and also for doing something you understood to be important, namely, travelling to Northern Kosovo, even spending a night there to make it clear to the population that you are right behind them. You made a speech at the university and opened EU offices there. I believe this was an important sign in making clear what the European Parliament stated in the past and reiterates now, namely, its support for an independent Kosovo on its way into the European Union. We are once again faced with a situation where Kosovo finds itself at a crossroads, particularly in relation to the members of all of Kosovo ’ s ethnic groups. In a few weeks, the International Court of Justice will decide and give its opinion on the position in relation to the declaration of independence made a little more than two years ago. I hope that this decision will provide a window of opportunity for placing regional cooperation on a new footing, but starting from the premise of Kosovo ’ s statehood and independence, making it clear that the common future for all states in the region – for Serbia, Kosovo and all the others – is as members of the European Union and that the problems that still exist will have to be resolved as they move in this direction. The wording of the resolution makes it clear: Kosovo ’ s future lies within the European Union. I am pleased that we have a majority in favour of calling on the five Member States who have not yet recognised Kosovo to do so soon and demanding that the Commission should start the process of visa liberalisation as soon as possible. It is important that the citizens of the country, in particular, the younger generations, should not be made to feel that they are living in an isolated state, while everyone in the surrounding regions will soon benefit from future changes. I believe this is the challenge. I hope that I will also receive a big majority in favour in tomorrow ’ s plenary sitting. I have also submitted a new amendment that expresses deep regret at the outbreak of violence in recent days and the hope that the matter will be investigated quickly and impartially and will not provide the basis for an escalation of emotions in the coming days and weeks.	
en.20100707.31.3-481.wav	Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been shocked by recent events in Kyrgyzstan – the violent outbreaks, human slaughter, the burning of houses and the flood of thousands of refugees leaving their homes in an effort to escape the violence – and am filled with sympathy for the victims. At the same time, these events in Kyrgyzstan throw light on the situation in Central Asia, which should not leave us unconcerned here in the European Parliament. On the contrary, we should turn all our attention to the countries of this region. We should consider not just those countries that are rich in mineral resources, making them of particular economic interest to us in Europe, but, in line with the strategy for Central Asia adopted in 2007, we should deal with all countries equally. I believe that this is our duty. The states of Central Asia, which managed to throw off Tsarist and then Soviet rule less than 20 years ago, have a difficult legacy. The borders drawn up arbitrarily by Stalin with no concern for the homelands of the peoples living in the region clearly make coexistence difficult both within the borders of these countries and beyond. Poverty, corruption, disregard for human rights and minority rights, authoritarian regimes, economic conditions in countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which force hundreds of thousands to emigrate in search of work, and conflict resolution through the use of violent force, all mean that there is a question mark over how the countries in this region are to develop in the future. The European Union cannot stand idly by while this happens. If we want to ensure that these states do not end up adopting fundamentalist structures and that the people there are not permanent victims of dictatorial regimes, then our complete commitment is required. In addition to answering the urgent need for material help, we need contact with these countries, offering active support for the democratic forces developing there. Let us allow President Roza Otunbayeva the chance to bring peace to Kyrgyzstan and to begin the establishment of stable political conditions. The resolution debated today and voted on tomorrow should be followed by actions, so that the people in Kyrgyzstan and the other Central Asian states do not feel that we are leaving them alone to find their future path or abandoning them to undemocratic forces. These countries have high expectations of us Europeans and we should not disappoint them.	
en.20100708.17.4-222.wav	Mr President, I voted against the Brok report for four reasons. The architecture of the service has numerous weaknesses, the details of which still cause us great concern. The second point is that the European Union ambassador will manage Commission funds in future. That exposes these funds to numerous risks, and the safeguards against these risks are still extremely unclear. The third point is the relinquishment of the rights of this Parliament in a Council regulation. We are de facto codecision-makers in this procedure and yet we have allowed the Council regulation to anticipate our parliamentary rights. Therefore, as regards my dossier – the Financial Regulation – I would like to say that I do not consider myself bound by today ’ s decisions. The fourth point is the question of how we actually treat each other in Parliament. We adopted a parliamentary reform during the last parliamentary term as well as procedures that we have now all trampled underfoot, including with the approval of the Bureau and that of the President. Why carry out a parliamentary reform that stipulates procedures if, when it matters, we violate these procedures and do not follow them? For these reasons, I cannot vote in favour of this report.	
en.20100908.19.3-447.wav	Mr President, Mr Dalli, I am very much in favour of green genetic engineering, but cloning is something else altogether. The two things cannot be compared. Cloning involves cruelty to animals, as many of my fellow Members have already said. In the discussion which we had before the summer recess, I explained that only a fraction of animal clones are capable of surviving. Many of those which do initially survive go on to die at a very early age in great agony. They have deformed extremities and organs. They have weakened immune systems and are susceptible to disease. This leads to pain, suffering and an agonising death. Can we accept responsibility for this? If we really are in favour of animal welfare, should we be supporting methods of this kind? No, we should not. That is why we decided in July that we did not want cloned meat or the products of cloned animals. This is a consistent approach. It is true that we know that the products of cloned animals and their offspring probably cause no damage to human health, and personally, I believe that they are suitable for human consumption, but there is no shortage of meat produced by conventional methods. So why should we make use of clones? It is completely unnecessary to treat animals cruelly. The people of Europe do not want this and they do not want these products. We do not need them. There is no argument for introducing cloned meat into the European Union. This is why we want a clear regulation which applies specifically to cloned animals and their offspring. I want to see a ban on cloning and cloned products in the European Union and I believe that we can push this through. Of course, it must also apply to imports. I want to be sure that I am not being fobbed off with cloned meat on the quiet, because it is not labelled, as has just happened in Scotland. I do not believe that all meat can be traced back to its origins. This may be possible in the case of beef. However, it is not possible to tell whether there is a cloned animal in the ancestry of a specific pig, because of the amount of pork produced. This is a fundamental, ethical question. Other Members have said that we need to deal with ethical issues, because we are responsible for them. This is, of course, a question of animal welfare, but it also concerns another issue. Experience shows, and I am a livestock farmer, I have studied this subject, that all the reproduction methods which have been proven to function in livestock rearing eventually find their way into human medicine. Therefore, we must ask ourselves today whether we want and are able to accept human cloning in the possibly not too distant future. I do not want to and I am not able to. Even if a clone was created of me to supply spare parts and, in future, was able to donate a vital organ for my use, I would still not want this to happen. I do not believe that this is an exaggerated horror story. I believe that this would be possible in the not too distant future if we were to permit cloning to take place. Therefore, we urgently need a ban not only on cloning, but also on cloned animals and their offspring throughout the EU. I am not afraid of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We can push this through. We do not have to imitate everything that the USA does, despite our transatlantic relationship.	
en.20100920.23.1-233.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is no coincidence that we are not finding it easy to agree on this matter here because we are combining two incompatible issues. If we had concentrated on trademark protection, we would probably have been able to reach a good agreement. However, mixing this with the subject of the Internet is also substantially incorrect, because different and newer strategies are required here compared with those required in substantive law. It is not easy to transfer these strategies from the one to the other. We also need to be clear in our own minds that we will pay for every prosecution on the Internet with infringements of civil rights, because we cannot see or find these things out automatically. Thirdly, it is abundantly clear to me that if I place cultural enjoyment on the Internet under the threat of punishment, so that I virtually risk being sent to prison every time I view the Internet, I will not be able to make use of the opportunities that the Internet also provides for art, culture and creativity. I would therefore urge us to discuss this matter further. That would be a more intelligent approach.	
en.20100920.23.1-235.wav	Mr President, property – whether intellectual or physical – is a cornerstone of the market economy. It is therefore important that we consider how we regulate this matter with a high degree of mutual consensus. In any case, we need a one-stop shop. It must become easier for consumers, the self-employed and small and medium-sized enterprises to acquire corresponding licences in this regard. The availability of EU-wide licences for intellectual property rights is particularly important. We need an internal market for intellectual property. Above all, we also need the original language to be available throughout the whole of Europe. Every language is an important cultural product and it ought to be possible for licences that are granted for one language to apply throughout Europe and therefore be capable of being used by all citizens. We need interoperability and technical neutrality in order to be able to use this intellectual property accordingly. Above all, we also need sanctions for those who violate competition and commercial law.	
en.20100921.20.2-575.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Council does not wish to debate the multiannual financial framework. May I tell the Council that the European Parliament would very much like to debate it, and that the Council cannot act as if it is in a kindergarten by telling us that it will not answer our questions or comment on our proposals. Secondly, in this connection, I must ask the Council whether it wants to have Lisbon or not. Lisbon is not a mere technical adjustment; it imposes more competences and means there are more responsibilities to discharge – and that includes answering related financial questions. Moreover, the Council has taken decisions that result in new financial expenditure. That has been mentioned by many of my fellow Members. If the Council wishes to do this, and if it does not want more money to be spent, then it must also state quite specifically where and how it wishes savings to be made, where exactly these funds are to be shifted from – and not simply propose general percentages to be redeployed while leaving Parliament and the Commission with the unpleasant task of deciding where the money is to be taken from, especially since our opportunities for redeployment and budgetary revision are extremely limited. The additional responsibilities that you have imposed on us are so challenging that they do not involve small incidental amounts – I will merely mention the area of the financial solidarity of our Member States and their corresponding financial difficulties. If the programme is to be implemented, then we are not taking about small sums that can be redeployed without further consideration. The same applies to ITER, the same applies to matters of internal security, the same applies to significant matters relating to research, the same also applies to questions concerning Parliament ’ s priority areas such as youth training and research. We have to deal not only with shortcomings in implementation, but also with a lack of transparency when it comes to the disbursement of funds. We need to debate and work through all these matters quite specifically; the Council cannot simply keep silent on them.	
en.20100921.23.2-716.wav	Commissioner Hahn, ladies and gentlemen, I have a problem with some of this debate. Listening to some of the contributions about mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas, I get the impression that these are exterritorial and directly subject to the European Union. That is not the case, however. Each of these areas belongs to a sovereign Member State. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the implementation of European decisions and objectives remains a matter for the Member States. At European level, we have always paid particular attention to precisely these regions – mountain regions, sparsely populated areas, islands – in Commission communications right up to the Treaty of Lisbon. Here in Parliament, too, many decisions have been made that support these regions. When I hear so many here complaining that these areas are still in a poor state, then I have to ask myself what the Member States have done with the initiatives that we provided at European level. What have the regions themselves done with them? How have they used the European assistance provided? What is called for here is a new strategy, and I feel sorry for the officials of the Directorate General on Regional Policy who have to integrate the multitude of problems suffered by islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated areas into one strategy. At the same time, there is such strategy inflation – strategies for the Danube, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, for climate change and suchlike – that we will soon need a strategy for the strategies if we are to maintain an overview of them all. Joking apart, ladies and gentlemen, what it is really about – as has been said here today, and I am grateful to Commissioner Hahn for mentioning it – is that we need to fight to ensure that we still have a cohesion policy and a regional policy at European level after 2013. That is what our work should focus on, and we need to convince our fellow Members of this. Mountain regions, islands and other areas would all find their place in a continued policy on cohesion and regional policy beyond 2013. There is no point in wasting our time on individual motions for resolution on this subject.	
en.20100921.3.2-013.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank the Members of this House who have worked so hard on this project and, in particular, Mr Vidal-Quadras. This proves that the European political system is capable of responding to crises and providing useful solutions. We have seen supply security situations of this kind on several occasions. As a result, the problem of security of supply has become much clearer. We have been forced to act and we have taken the necessary action. We have found solutions which are not straightforward, which involve new instruments and which, and this is the interesting aspect of all of this for me, not only put in place infrastructure standards in Europe, not only create common rules for prevention and emergency plans, not only provide the certainty, which Mr Oettinger has rightly referred to, that we can offer our citizens 30 days of security in future, but also demonstrate that we are able to reach compromises which produce viable results. The process was laborious, but it is now clear that the focus is on the role and the responsibilities of the companies which build and manage the networks. We are not saying that everything must be done at any price, but we are leaving ourselves scope for evaluating individual cases and improving cooperation in the regions. Equally important is the reference to the fact that although the Member States must be aware of their own responsibilities, if they cannot find the necessary solutions, the Commission will have an additional job to do. The Commission ’ s role has been reinforced, but it is not the sole decision maker. Last but not least, we must ensure that there are solutions in place. This is the good news from Brussels for the people of Europe.	
en.20101007.5.4-053.wav	Mr President, Mr Hahn, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe. However, I also believe that in future, regional policy and cohesion policy must focus more closely on our cities. Cities are an important driving force behind development in Europe. At the same time, they are currently suffering from environmental, economic and social problems. This is why I have a particular question for Mr Hahn. What opportunities do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension? To come to the point, Mr Hahn, you recently indicated during an event which took place in this House that you had a specific percentage of the regional funding in mind which would be reserved for highlighting the urban dimension. Is this still the case? If so, what percentage were you thinking of?	
en.20101007.5.4-088.wav	Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Hahn, the former Austrian Minister for Science and Research, for starting a new debate which will make a major contribution to promoting growth in Europe. If every small and medium-sized company in Europe were to create one additional job, we would have no more unemployment in Europe. Therefore, we should be thinking about how we can enable these small and medium-sized businesses to hire new employees and also to play a more active role on international export markets. However, the research and transport infrastructures are also important concerns. The Commission has major tasks ahead of it when it comes to restructuring the East-West connection, for example, from Paris to Budapest, or the North-South connection. New jobs, which are urgently needed in Europe at the moment, can be created in these areas.	
en.20101018.13.1-029.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women, yet there are still many women who are forced into low-skilled jobs. That applies not just to activities that are traditionally carried out within the family. The deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical, precarious and uncertain. Women, in particular, have been affected by this. The trend in employment in Europe between 2000 and 2010 is for 60% to be made up of new, precarious and atypical types of employment, primarily – two thirds – taken up by women. Women are frequently debarred from democratic participation in organisations by virtue of being employed on a part-time basis and on precarious conditions. Yet women are now much more committed and better trained than in any previous generation. Nonetheless, on average, they earn 25% less than men. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has looked into this matter intensively and has developed good proposals on the issue of female employment: inclusion in social security systems regardless of job status; the establishment of childcare facilities; aligning retirement pensions and social systems with independent living; and organising work according to ‘ good work ’ principles. All this is essentially contained in the report on precarious women workers. The Employment Committee is satisfied with the results of this work and urges the House to vote in favour of the report presented.	
en.20101020.26.3-691.wav	Madam President, Mr Chastel, landmines will probably continue to be a major problem even far into the future. Do you believe that it is possible to initiate dedicated research programmes into the detection of landmines? Of course, this is not a European problem, it is a global problem. Can you envisage also finding suitable institutions that grapple with research programmes in this field?	
en.20101110.14.3-055.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the transatlantic dialogue, there are many things that unite us – I am talking about basic values, the fundamental rights of freedom and democracy – but there are also some things that divide us, namely, how these rights are applied and put in concrete terms when it comes to transatlantic relations. In particular, this contradiction repeatedly comes very clearly to the fore in respect of security issues. Data protection is a source of constant misunderstanding; we have long known that. Consequently, the framework agreement – if we succeed in bringing about a very good one – will be a great step forward. We need to find a solution here that also enables citizens on both sides of the Atlantic to assert their rights in respect of the other partner. A second important area in which our principles are similar but our approaches diverge considerably is the area of climate change. I would therefore very much like to see this on the agenda and being clearly discussed. We cannot allow the European Union to use the transatlantic dialogue to weaken its own promises and commitments.	
en.20101110.16.3-133.wav	Mr President, this regulation of alternative investment fund managers provides, firstly, a little more in the way of transparency and rules in this impenetrable jungle of hedge funds and alternative investment funds. Unfortunately, these rules remain incomplete. It is still possible to place unregulated products on the internal market by using passive distribution. Essentially, market access for these products is not restricted effectively. Europe has thus missed an opportunity to extend its rules worldwide and to achieve uniform regulation. Secondly, contrary to Parliament ’ s wishes, there was, unfortunately, no effective balanced budget rule at European level for the funds. It is still left up to national rules to limit how far the funds can go into debt, and that also means that we are not learning the lessons from the crisis. As a result, there will be a national downhill race in respect of this regulation. What is crucial for us once again is the fact that the asset stripping of companies by private equity funds is not prevented effectively. Of course, there are private equity investments that make sense for companies. However, the rules that are now being laid down are, unfortunately, a long way from being adequate. The rights of workers to information, which they quite rightly expect, are not effective, either, and neither is the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises against this type of asset stripping. In this case, therefore, this is very difficult to justify to the electorate. Unfortunately, the responsibility for this does not lie with Parliament. It lies, in particular, with the intensive lobbying by the sector concerned, which has had particular success with the UK Government, the French Government and, sadly, I have to say, to a certain extent with the German Government. This lobby was also represented here in Parliament by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. We cannot support this proposal, because it would set a precedent for the failure of Parliament to implement effective rules. It is not possible for us to stand before our electorate with our heads held high and say that we have succeeded in regulating this netherworld effectively. We hope that we will make some progress in the revision of the directive. I would like to say a big thank you once again, particularly for the cooperation with my fellow Members in Parliament.	
en.20101122.13.1-042.wav	Madam President, I would first like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Balz for such constructive cooperation. I can only emphasise the fact that despite coming from different positions, working together was a positive experience. Many people thought – and I would like to underline this fact again here – that the crisis in the euro area was over. Ireland shows that this is not the case. Just as before, Europe is voluntarily offering itself up to the financial markets. The EU Member States are still having to offer their treasury bonds in the bazaar of the financial markets and try to gain the confidence of the speculators by adopting suicidal austerity packages. At the weekend, we saw once again where that leads us. This time it was not the Greeks, who were supposedly out to deceive everyone, but rather Ireland – the star pupil – that was forced to turn to the European bail-out fund in order to rescue its banking system – a system which had also long been held up as a shining example of deregulation. In the meantime, the financial sector is already eyeing up Portugal for capitulation as its interest rates continue to rise. The European Central Bank must share the responsibility for this drama. It has failed and continues to fail to use eurobonds in order to offer a civilised alternative to this casino approach. While half of Europe is recovering from the crisis, the ECB idly stands by as the remaining part falls further and further into poverty and uncertainty. Ruinous cuts across the board by national economies may be to the taste of the European investment and banking giants, but they do nothing to help either Ireland or the monetary union and the ECB. Please pay no attention to Mrs Merkel ’ s simplified financial ABC, Mr Trichet. If you want to save the economic and monetary union, do not leave European treasury bonds hanging in the air. Introduce eurobonds before the speculators claim their next victim.	
en.20101122.17.1-155.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when you consider how we debated this proposal from the Commission during the last parliament – going from outright rejection to celebrating all the good things coming our way – then I must say that I am very enthusiastic about what has been tabled here. For this, we owe the rapporteur and his co-rapporteurs a great deal of thanks for having brought together this broad spectrum of opinions into a coherent position. I feel that the key words here are ‘ patient oriented ’. In other words, we have not been distracted by peripherals but instead have asked what it is that the patient needs. I believe it is right that we have established that patients are able to obtain information from a number of channels, not just one. I should like to reiterate, however, that the doctor must continue to be the trusted point of contact for the patient and must undoubtedly have an influence over decisions. The way we are guaranteeing that is by banning advertising and ensuring that the information patients receive has been checked and approved by an authority. This means that the information is based on scientific fact to start with, so patients can rely on it. Of course, it is true that not everyone is able to find these things out via the Internet. That is why we have various channels, however, and I think it is so widespread that we do not need to worry about that. I only hope that the Council will now at last have the courage to deal with this matter. It is very important; action needs to be taken quickly. Our patients expect it. Then we will have done a good job.	
en.20101123.5.2-044.wav	Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, no one disputes the fact that coal is an important part of our energy supply. It is also indisputable that the mining industry must be competitive and that subsidising it is not the correct approach. The question now is whether 2014 or 2018 is the right deadline. Mr Rapkay put forward a number of intelligent arguments which I will not repeat. I have only one request to the Commission. In all the committees in Parliament which were involved, there is majority support for making competitiveness a criterion. When it comes to the deadline, we must simply ensure that there is the necessary flexibility to allow the Member States to keep the pressure on the people, the jobs and the economic structures at a manageable level. The only argument which has been mentioned and which, incidentally, conflicts with the Commission ’ s impact statement that initially seemed to be in favour of 2018, was that environmental policy reasons could play a role here. I would like to emphasise once again that it makes no difference to the climate whether we burn imported or domestic coal. My request to the Commissioner is to consider, if Parliament and the Council can come up with new arguments of this kind, whether this four-year deadline could lead to the Commission being a little more flexible. This is how I understood the reference just now to the Commission considering the issue and I am grateful for this.	
en.20101124.20.3-315.wav	. Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, if we are to learn anything from Copenhagen, where you, Commissioner, were of course President, then it should be that the European Union must speak with one voice at such conferences in future. We may have different opinions here on one or two points, but if we as Europeans are divided in what we say there, we will not be considered credible, and if we are not credible other people will not follow us. Indeed, why should they? It is therefore right for the figures we decided on under Chancellor Merkel essentially to be retained and form the basis for this negotiation. I share your opinion that the ambitious two-degree targets should not now be seriously questioned and a significantly lower degree figure considered, because that will make the ability to meet these targets very much more difficult and people will shy away from us. I am very concerned that we are putting our intellectual property at risk. Our industry is investing money and manpower in development. If we now go and slacken the fence around this intellectual property and leave the holes in the fence that currently exist, then we will lose the valuable elements, namely our intellectual property. I am all in favour of the transfer of technology, but our enterprises must also see the sense in investing in it, and therefore the intellectual property must not be watered down. As regards commitments, I am also inclined to demand serious commitments from our partners worldwide. However, they must be credible and it must be feasible for these countries to fulfil them. Otherwise they will do exactly the opposite of what we want, in other words they will distance themselves from us. Presenting ourselves in a credible manner in Cancún is therefore important. The major decisions will then be taken later in Johannesburg, but we need to prepare the ground in Cancún. I am a farmer by profession. If the ground is not properly prepared, there will be no harvest. Let us concentrate on preparing good ground.	
en.20101124.8.3-101.wav	Mr President, during the debate on the European Council here this morning there was an incident that I do not wish to go into again, because I was the target of an insult. However, I will say this: there are levels at which I cannot be insulted and where I do not see it as an insult either, because in order to insult me, someone must have a certain degree of sincerity. However, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the numerous signs of solidarity that I have since received in this House. I would very much like to thank my fellow Members from all groups. That is a sign of the common, democratic and pro-European conviction that the overwhelming majority of this House shares. I would like to thank you very sincerely for this.	
en.20101214.37.2-516.wav	Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, Mr Gauzès, ladies and gentlemen and shadow rapporteurs, I am indeed pleased that we have now taken this step and that for the first time, a sector of the European financial system will be placed under direct European supervision. It is also a step towards a strong Europe in an internal market and the firm control of a sector that contributed to the crisis. I would like to make one more comment on this. Mr Barnier, the selection process is, of course, currently under way for the new authorities, and the new authorities are only as good as their staff. I can only hope that the staff will genuinely be selected on the basis of expertise, independence from the financial industry that they are to control and the clear desire to serve in the public interest, and that we will not see national quotas again in the selection process that disregard these important criteria. In addition, we still have a great deal to do in the area of credit rating agencies. We still have no real transparency when it comes to the information with which the credit rating agencies work and there is far too great a use of regulatory ratings in the financial sector and in the regulations governing the financial industry. We have serious conflicts of interest, we quite clearly have a market power of three major providers and there is no liability for negligently issued ratings. Commissioner, it is good that the consultation is now under way and we await the results with interest. Civil society, in particular, should be involved in this consultation, but then you need to put forward a courageous proposal. I am already looking forward to your proposal. Please be as courageous as you have been up to now, and let us produce legislation together during the next year that solves the problems that are still present on the credit rating market in a genuinely European way. We owe this to our citizens.	
en.20101214.37.2-518.wav	Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the last few months since the beginning of this year have shown the damage that credit rating agencies can do. There is therefore an urgent need for action. I, too, therefore welcome the directive, in particular, the fact that the supervision and registration of credit rating agencies will be transferred to ESMA. That is an important and positive step in the right direction. However, numerous good and progressive proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations on the report. I would like to mention this once again. Thus, the appointment of ESMA remains the only real and positive change. The proposals for a public database for the issuing of credit ratings have been dropped, as has any reference to the establishment of a public credit rating agency. The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about. Moreover, the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products. This, too, has come to nothing. I hope that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the reports on this matter that are still to come and that were mentioned by Mr Gauzès and by you, Mr Barnier.	
en.20101214.40.2-631.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank those who have worked on this report and, in particular, Mr Bendtsen. I would like to mention two aspects and perhaps give you pause for thought. We are all agreed that energy efficiency, using energy economically, is the most simple and most sensible solution. The question is: how do we achieve this goal? I would also like to ask the question: what have we actually achieved here in Parliament by keep going back to the people with new and higher percentages? Have we really achieved more and had more of an effect? Why and in which areas have we been using energy more efficiently? I am told that industry, which consumes a lot of energy, is using energy more efficiency because it saves money by doing so and because it is beneficial for it. I am also told that when people know that a particular appliance consumes more or less energy, in other words, if they can see that and can see an advantage to themselves, they will decide in favour of energy efficiency. Perhaps working with percentages is completely the wrong way to go about it and we should instead take an incentives approach. My second question is: the Commissioner made some very eloquent and clear comments about how complicated it is just to explain what energy efficiency is. What is it in fact? How differently is it implemented in the Member States? My fellow Member has just pointed out that the Member States also have very different situations in terms of their economies and geography – completely different. Is it the right solution to work with a single binding figure, or should we not think of something else? I think that, in terms of energy policy, we need, to a certain extent, to move away from the debate of the past, which sought to achieve something with simple figures, binding targets and miracle solutions, because we have clearly not achieved enough. Perhaps, for once, we should try the alternative route of differentiated, varied solutions, which takes account of the different situations, but then also achieves results. What matters is the effect we achieve rather than our particular circumstances.	
en.20101215.32.3-650.wav	Mr President, the regulation that is being discussed today has been largely disregarded by all the committees over a long period. However, some people in this House have now woken up at the end of the process when the results are on the table. Some of them have unfortunately not attended the debate, which is a pity because it would have been very interesting to hear their views. As a former member, I have a clear memory of the spirit of the convention. It called openly for the European Parliament to be given specific rights in several areas, to ensure that it remained credible in the context of the institutions and with regard to the citizens. Despite the convention ’ s demands, nothing was done. The very tough negotiations which the Belgian Presidency had with the Council were what enabled important progress to be made. I remember what Mr Lehne said. It was a question of the permanent possibility of investigating whether the Commission had exceeded its powers. Of course, some of the regulations are not exactly ideal, such as the international trade agreement, but nevertheless I agree with the outcome. I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency. It has made every effort to ensure that something was achieved. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who negotiated sympathetically and intelligently.	
en.20101215.9.3-167.wav	Mr President, I would like to make the following explanation on behalf of our group about Amendment 13. This is an amendment which my colleague Mr Färm tabled to the Committee on Budgets on behalf of our group. We have not tabled this amendment again, but the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has retabled it with 40 signatures. We will abstain from voting on this amendment. However, I have come to an understanding with the Greens about this and we are of exactly the same opinion. As we have said that we, as a group, will not table any new amendments, we are abstaining. However, I would like to make it quite clear that we support this point, the financial transaction tax, and we hope that the Members on the other side of the House will support us on votes in the near future.	
en.20110119.20.3-164-000.wav	Madam President, I believe it is important that we do not use the national tax systems to work against the internal market. This is essential particularly in the case of cross-border services which is where equal treatment is needed. There is currently a negative example of this in Hungary, where retrospective price limits are being used as a form of crisis tax. This is not acceptable and it will have a serious impact on the financial, insurance and business sectors and also the energy industry. I hope that the same thing will not happen in future in the field of healthcare services. I would like to ask Mr Orbán to re-evaluate these regulations, because they are in complete opposition to the concept of the internal market.	
en.20110119.27.3-580-000.wav	Mr President, it is important that the EU comes to grips with the problems of migration and the right of asylum. The Commission has submitted proposals in this area. However, there is currently no accurate analysis of the implementation of existing legal provisions. There are also hardly any detailed calculations and analyses concerning the new proposals. The Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports the right of asylum and the right to protection for people who need it. However, when we look at the actual situation, it is unfortunately clear that people are applying for asylum for very different reasons or even systematically abusing the system. The right of asylum and subsidiary protection is not a tool for general migration into the 27 Member States. We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people ’ s fates as a result of our right of asylum. Asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care. Victims of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the EU. This is why the Commission ’ s obligations in this respect are laid down in the new drafts. I think many of them are appropriate, including interpreters, proper healthcare and taking into consideration special protection needs. However, I would also like to mention the points which I believe are problematic. The authorities in the Member States are being given far too few opportunities to prevent abuse. The option of the accelerated procedure and the border procedure should be restricted by applying charges. If an applicant commits a serious breach of his duty of cooperation, there are very few possibilities of imposing sanctions. On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion. If he reappears, he is offered an extended range of procedural options. Even if an application is obviously without any foundation, the use of the accelerated procedure will only be possible after the second subsequent application. This will lead to significant cost increases. The current Commission draft states that free legal advice will be available from a lawyer, which will also result in the Member States ’ costs rising considerably. I would simply like the Commission to reconsider the practical consequences of its proposals, the financial impact and the problems for the authorities in the Member States. We want to see a system with high standards, but it must be workable and should not present already overburdened Member States with completely impossible tasks.	
en.20110119.27.3-599-000.wav	Mr President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly. I have a request for you, Mr Füle. I would like to start by saying that incorrect assumptions lead to incorrect cost estimates. At the moment, the number of asylum seekers is not falling, but rising significantly. This is a result of visa facilitation, for example, for Serbia and Macedonia. We are currently also seeing a massive increase in abuses of the asylum system as part of attempts to enter countries in the European Union. If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures. However, that is not the case. If overall standards are raised, the consequence will be cost increases. Improving the standard of quality for everyone and making the procedures more complex will, in reality, result in increased costs. I am more than happy to discuss this point. Therefore, I would like to ask you specifically to take the concerns of the countries seriously, because some of the practical reports from the countries have already been completed and will be distributed.	
en.20110120.3.4-023-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to this report, the Commission is following a successful policy on competition. However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider. In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens. A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice. A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem. A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation. More work is urgently needed on this. For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition. The report sets down pointers for the Commission ’ s future policy on competition. There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels. It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe.	
en.20110202.13.3-032-000.wav	. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important moment, because today, for the first time in the European Parliament, we are commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust. Let me start by with a farewell letter written by a 14-year-old boy, Robert Reinhard, in 1943 before his deportation to Auschwitz from a German children ’ s home. He wrote: ‘ I have found my parents again. We are being transported to the concentration camp. After much soul-searching I have reached the point where I can face death. Thank you once again for everything that you have done for me. Greetings to you all. See you in heaven. Robert. ’ Like 500 000 other Roma and Sinti, this young boy never came back, and although the Roma and Sinti, together with the Jews, were the first victims of production line killing, today – 66 years on – the full truth of what happened remains untold. The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over. We need the whole truth about this chapter of history. The Roma and Sinti must be avenged and the Holocaust recognised as a crime against humanity, to ensure that it can never happen again. We must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people. We must put an end to racial hatred as well as violence, as seen the year before last in Hungary for example, and we should do this with the courage of our convictions. Freedom, equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few, but a right for all, because human rights and civil rights are indivisible.	
en.20110202.17.3-234-000.wav	. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this is a question of making the best possible use of the possibilities provided by the law to actually provide strong financial supervision in Europe, and we have our doubts about whether these possibilities are in fact being utilised to the best possible extent in the institutions. We are seeing shortcomings in the procedure. As Parliament, we have so far not been able to see the list of candidates in advance, but only the finished result. It would be very easy to send us this list now for the executive directors. We quite clearly have a lack of gender equality when it comes to filling the posts, and, due to certain events during the process, we have our doubts about whether the Member States will in fact fill the posts in this institution in the interests of Europe. That and the other points in our letter entitle us to ask a fundamental question. However, over and above this there is, of course, also the question of the suitability of the individuals, and in this regard each person has to be assessed individually on the basis of their skills. We see two major problems with this. In the hearings, we found that one of the candidates disputed the fact that this was a European institution, but talked instead about a network of supervisory authorities, and even when asked about it he was not prepared to correct this. We did not receive any clear responses when we asked them whether they were prepared to make all lobbyist contact with the financial industry transparent. We have sent a letter to all three candidates, and as far as we are concerned the outcome of the vote is dependent on whether we receive clear and comprehensive responses to this.	
en.20110214.12.1-024-000.wav	Mr President, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also wish to table a motion of this nature. However, I would like to recommend to Mr Mauro and the House that we formulate it somewhat more precisely. After all, we have to deal with an enormous influx of people. I am sure that Italy, like every other country on the Mediterranean, is overstretched in trying to deal with the current problem alone, and she is not the only country facing this massive flow of refugees. We can assume that Malta, Greece and Spain, too, will be confronted by this problem in the foreseeable future. We would therefore ask that the title of the debate be very precisely worded so that, specifically, we obtain a statement from the Commission on immediate measures on the part of the European Union to support Italy and other affected EU countries in dealing with the influx of refugees.	
en.20110215.4.2-068-000.wav	Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the result of the conciliation procedure. When the regulation is implemented, bus and coach passengers, including those with reduced mobility, will have the same high level of protection that applies on other forms of transport. In addition, the regulation guarantees a high overall level of consumer protection and takes into consideration the fact that this transport sector consists mainly of small and medium-sized companies. The extreme requirements which would have made bus transport almost impossible have been removed, together with those that would have excluded the majority of the Member States from the scope of the regulation. Bus and coach services which benefit the majority of citizens must also provide a high quality service for disabled people and people with reduced mobility. They should have the right to receive help and this must be provided free of charge in the interests of social integration.	
en.20110215.4.2-073-000.wav	Madam President, I would like to congratulate everyone involved, but in particular, Mr Cancian, for all his efforts during the tough and long-winded process of reaching a compromise on this difficult dossier. Some of the successes have already been mentioned, but there were also disappointments, in particular, with regard to the scope and other small points which have been referred to. By coming to this compromise on bus and coach transport, we have established passengers ’ rights on all types of transport. The next step which we need to take is to create a common, coherent and efficient framework programme for all passengers ’ rights. It is particularly important for the credibility of the EU among the citizens of Europe that we put in place fair and clearly defined rights. In order to be credible, we must ensure that the rights across all the different means of transport are coherent. The criteria relating to air passengers ’ rights must not be fundamentally different from those of rail passengers, for example. Therefore, it is particularly important that we do not base our framework programme on the lowest, weakest standards. Instead, we must set ourselves ambitious goals on behalf of the citizens of Europe.	
en.20110216.5.3-075-000.wav	Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the midst of a major economic crisis – we have been talking about this for months and everything we have said is true – as a rule, however, we tend to talk in very broad terms and then cheerfully continue to make decisions here as if nothing is happening. I believe this is because here in Parliament we do not act in a specific enough way and we are not honest enough, but rather pursue something resembling a general, headlines policy. What are we actually doing to promote growth and stability? Are we ourselves actually contributing to a more proper and wiser way of dealing with finances? Are we really carrying out a critical review of whether we are making the right kinds of expenditure, or does every one of us not have a new idea every day about where we could spend more money? If we do not have the strength to focus our financial resources on projects for the future – and that will involve altercations, debates and decisions – then there is no point in talking about innovation and research only to then fail to make the necessary funds available. That is rather dishonest. If we want to breathe life into the economy, we must also pursue a policy that stimulates the economy and not endlessly sit thinking about how we can interfere with industry or the economy. We cheerfully take more decisions – even today we are constantly calling for new decisions that will interfere with the development of the economy. Does anyone believe that the question of mandatory energy efficiency – to name just one example – will help to drive the economy forward? Do you really believe that, with the decisions we have often made in connection with energy, we have stimulated the economy? Or have we obstructed it? I would like us for once to talk a bit more honestly about this and then to make somewhat fewer decisions, but perhaps ones that will really bring about progress. That will be more challenging and it will take more effort, but it is in the interests of democracy.	
en.20110307.17.1-034-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the call for a financial transaction tax is nothing new; opponents of globalisation have been calling for such a tax for some years. Just five years ago, however, hardly anyone would have thought that it might be possible to implement it in the foreseeable future. Yet this week, it is on the agenda of the European Parliament alongside a CO tax and Eurobonds, and rightly so in my opinion. I can only welcome and support the financial instruments proposed by Mrs Podimata in her report, and I believe they will be voted through. These instruments are urgently needed. So far, the consolidation of national budgets has concentrated solely on cuts in expenditure. However, cuts in public spending primarily impact workers, pensioners and the poor; in other words, those reliant on the welfare state. The income side of public financing has been completely disregarded to date. It is the second lever that we can use to consolidate national budgets. In particular, addressing the income side would result in the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis shouldering an appropriate part of the public debt. If we are to consolidate national budgets, then it is quite simply imperative that we increase tax revenues. In fact, the high level of public debt is mainly a result of the nationalisation of private debt; in other words, of governments taking on the debts of private banks and financing the consequences of the financial crisis. The states are thus in no way solely responsible for the debt crisis. Asking the financial sector to dip into its own pockets is therefore not simply obvious; it is our political duty. A financial transaction tax would at last mean this sector shouldering part of this debt as one of the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis. This report would send out an important political signal were it to be adopted as presented. Similarly, we consider Eurobonds to be a sensible and, thus, also a necessary instrument. They will do more to reduce debt than all the sanctions and advice put together, however well meant. The complaints by some countries in surplus that Eurobonds would increase their interest burden are unacceptable since, at the same time, these countries in surplus are earning more from their exports to deficit countries. Some might criticise this as a transfer union. However, anyone who wants a social Europe – who wants the EU to continue to hold together in the future – must accept the idea of a transfer union at least in principle. Finally, I would like to say to the Commission that I hope that it will now finally present proposals for a financial transaction tax; we have been calling for this for over a year now.	
en.20110310.3.4-012-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency. However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too. Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity. I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures.	
en.20110405.17.2-302-000.wav	. Mr Barroso, you are a very clever man, however you have not answered my question. I will therefore ask you again: when Mr Oettinger says ‘ We suspect that some of the plants currently connected to the network will not survive the stress tests ’, I interpret this to mean that you are aware that safety at these plants is so poor that they will not meet the criteria. So why not intervene straight away? I believe that this is a real and present danger.	
en.20110406.34.3-576-000.wav	Mr President, I would like to ask the representatives of the Council and the Commission why they believe that they have to address this subject using speech bubbles. I do not think that we are helping anyone by not making a specific statement to the effect that in the run-up to the Istanbul conference, the Member States and the European Union must finally meet their obligations in full and that we cannot tolerate Member States increasingly shirking their responsibilities. It is unacceptable that one billion people still live in hunger, most of them in the least developed countries (LDCs), in other words, the poorest countries in the world. It is also unacceptable that the majority of our development aid does not go to support and develop agriculture. The proportion used for this purpose has fallen rapidly in recent years, while one billion people go hungry. I am slowly beginning to think that saying that we hope the LDCs will become more resistant to shocks is a cynical approach. I am calling on you to take specific measures to address the problems and to make concrete commitments to provide the LDCs with real help.	
en.20110406.6.3-062-000.wav	Mr President, public procurement law and the awarding of public contracts are an essential part of the internal market. Mr Barnier, my response to your remarks about wanting to promote social integration in this context is that I have heard very little about protecting social rights or about protecting collective agreements. These are some of the fundamental rules which you, as you have said, do not want to call into question. If we want to protect the fundamental rules, we must ensure in future, during the process of awarding public contracts, that basic social standards are maintained, that collective agreements are not undermined, and that the use of cheap labour is prevented. All of this forms part of modern public procurement law. I would like to make it clear that we must no longer put greater emphasis on economic freedoms and free competition than on fundamental social rights. Either we want a social Europe or we want permanent conflict with the people who are turning away from Europe because it does not protect their interests.	
en.20110509.18.1-084-000.wav	Madam President, Mrs Kroes, the spectrum is a valuable and limited resource that must be managed with care and foresight, taking into account society as a whole. The radio spectrum policy programme is therefore of particular importance. The spectrum must be utilised efficiently, taking into account economic, social and cultural aspects. To this end, we must fully utilise the technical means available to us in all bands to achieve the greatest possible efficiency. The telecoms package adopted last year must form the basis of our radio spectrum policy because it also stipulates that the spectrum management of the EU and its Member States must take equal account of cultural, social and economic interests. This must be taken into consideration, in particular, in connection with the harmonisation of spectrum use in the EU. In this regard, I would like to point out that implementation of the first digital dividend in the Member States has so far been progressing at very different rates. Further opening of the UHF band, particularly below 800 MHz, should therefore only be considered after taking into account our experience with white spaces in this band. There are many technical and financial questions that are yet to be definitively resolved. In particular, the problem of interference and the question of cost offsetting for cultural facilities and local authorities in connection with technical retrofitting, with regard to radio microphones for example, have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. When allocating frequency bands, the various different interests must be weighed against each other in a responsible manner. On the one hand, provision of mobile broadband networks across the board is a basic requirement that is in the interests of European citizens, but, on the other hand, development in the area of public and private broadcasting must be taken into consideration as an important instrument for cultural diversity and the provision of information. We must set the correct course for technical development and for Europe ’ s position in the area of digital information technology and cultural diversity.	
en.20110511.35.3-568-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Rehn, first of all, I would like to say that the situation is indeed getting worse, as you have described. In the euro area, the divide between the countries which are showing signs of recovery and those which are in a more precarious position is widening. Also, the cost of supporting the weaker countries is constantly rising. Given this situation, I have some questions for you in your role as Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs. Liabilities between the central banks amounting to more than EUR 400 billion have accumulated in the TARGET2 accounts of the European Central Bank system. This is due to the fact that the banks are still not being adequately financed by the capital market. What is your view of these unplanned liabilities within the euro system? The major problem which is preventing us from making progress with debt restructuring is that the banking system, as Mrs Ford has also said, has not been properly reformed. The proposal for a European restructuring system has been delayed. When will the Commission submit this proposal? As Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, what is your view of this delay? What are you doing to speed things up? It has also become clear, as we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance have been predicting for a long time, that the measures put in place to support Greece and Portugal will not take effect until the macro-economic conditions in the euro area improve. These countries are still subject to a growing burden of interest. The export and outflow of capital in some of these countries is increasing. There is still a lack of demand among some of the European partners of these countries and among the strong countries in the euro area in particular. Resource and food prices are also rising, at least if you disregard the most recent ups and downs. In addition to the bail-out of these countries, and in addition to the financial aid, I would like to know which measures are being taken to relieve the burden of taxes, external demand and interest on these countries from a macro-economic perspective. How is this being achieved? I would therefore like to encourage you to put forward a strong package which will improve the macro-economic conditions in these countries in the euro area. Finally, the measures, which, in my view, run contrary to the spirit of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, have hit the weakest countries, including Greece, Portugal and Spain, while the stronger, wealthier countries have not yet taken on their share of the burden. Which measures will you be taking to encourage the wealthy countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis?	
en.20110512.31.4-356-000.wav	Mr President, Mrs Göncz is an MEP in the same group as me. You can be against Ferenc Gyurcsány, or for him. You can disapprove of Mrs Göncz, or you can support her. It is absolutely up to every individual to decide for themselves, freely and independently, whether they are for or against a given person ’ s political conviction. The debate that we are holding here concerns the last dictatorship left in Europe. We are holding it about one of the most brutal and bloodiest dictators on the continent of Europe. I find it totally unacceptable for a freely elected, democratic Member of my group to be compared with a bloodthirsty dictator. I feel that Parliament must also rebuff this, especially when it comes from the representative of a party that is characterised by a hate and persecution that it bestows on the Roma minority in Hungary that is unparalleled across Europe. If there is one person here who does not have the right to criticise Mrs Göncz, then that person is Mrs Morvai.	
en.20110512.9.4-063-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors, the cultural diversity of Europe is an important commodity that we need to preserve and even develop in future. In order to make that possible, we need to face the challenges of the digital age not only in the information and knowledge society, but also, above all, in the cultural and creative sector. Cultural diversity is not just an ideal; it is also a significant economic factor. Around five million people in the European Union are employed in the cultural sector. That equates to around 2.5% of the total population. The cultural sector is a growth sector that is developing faster than many other areas in the economy. The development of information and communications technologies is driven just as much by the content offered by the cultural sector as the nature and quality of that content have been changed and developed through technology. We therefore need a framework for the cultural and creative sector within which it can develop sustainably in the face of the challenges of the digital age. We need a modern, accessible and legally certain system in which everyone can develop on an equal footing. The cultural and creative sector is a driver for Europe. We therefore need to pay some attention to this area, including when it comes to education and training. We need to provide young people with cultural and creative skills – including within the scope of lifelong learning. However, we also need to improve the business skills of our creative artists and to give them a sound media grounding in new technologies. We need to create a framework within which those engaged in the cultural sector can safeguard their livelihoods. We therefore need to work intensively on the issues of copyright, social security and intellectual property, but also on open access to information and content, in order to ensure the continued development of the creative and cultural sector in the future in a digital environment and in order to enable us to retain cultural diversity and the cultural heritage of Europe as a significant distinguishing feature of the European Union.	
en.20110606.15.1-027-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Kelam, Members from the Baltic States, ladies and gentlemen, today we are, in particular, commemorating the expulsions and mass deportations from the Baltic States. These expulsions are among the darkest events of European history. The last century has been described, not without justification, as the century of expulsions. We are showing respect today for all of the victims of these inhumane acts. In this regard, we are demanding a full investigation of Soviet history and, in particular, the atrocities of Stalinism. The Russia of today should not see this as a political attack, but as an offer of support in engaging with its own history, which, just like the history of the other countries in Europe, is characterised by positive as well as negative times. However, just as we remember the victims from the Baltic States, we also think of the Armenians, who were expelled from Turkey at the start of the last century. We remember the so-called population exchange between Turkey and Greece. Deportations in Europe reached a peak, in particular, in the middle of the century as a result of the Nazi regime and the Communist regime of the Soviet Union. The expulsions following the Second World War also left deep wounds, as did the expulsions during the war in the former Yugoslavia. However, we must not forget that many cases of colonial rule were also characterised by expulsions. We must call for a serious debate on the various forms of expulsions and the supposed reasons for them. This should also include an investigation of guilt and punishment of the guilty, as far as this is still possible in any case, as is now happening in the case of Mladič, for example. The decisive answer to this, however, is European unification, particularly with the independent Baltic States, and a clear commitment to continuing the European unification process, which is not yet complete. This historic task is something that we owe not only to ourselves, but also, and in particular, to the victims of the many expulsions that have occurred in Europe. Many politicians from all of the countries of Europe, from East and West, have worked to bring this about. One example is the Gdańsk Declaration, signed by President Kwaśniewski of Poland and President Rau of Germany. Since we want to learn from the past, we need to be vigilant and also watch out for the first signs of expulsions taking place, as in the case of the Roma, for example. We need to reject any statements like those that maintain that we must send Arab immigrants back across the Mediterranean in their boats, and we must defend ourselves against those who want to put an end to our achievement of a Europe without borders and return once again to narrow-minded nationalism. Let us express our deepest respect for all of the victims of expulsions and deportations, but let us be united in committing ourselves to continuing European unification as the only real guarantee against a policy that brought so much misery to the people of Europe and beyond during the last century. We must never forget. It must never happen again. These were calls that were made immediately after the Second World War. They are still just as valid today and the best response to them is a united Europe.	
en.20110607.24.2-293-000.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity to experience the independence referendum in South Sudan as an electoral observer for Parliament and I was impressed by the major backing given by the South Sudanese people to the idea of deciding on the fate of their country themselves in future. I also witnessed the major expectations of the people who decided on the liberation of their country from bondage. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of what are known as internal displaced persons, who the decades-long fighting in the South had pushed into the refugee camps of the North, set off back to their former homes in the South. Of course, alongside the independence of their country, the people of South Sudan want, above all, to live in peace and find a way to a happier future after the decades of war in which millions of South Sudanese were forced to sacrifice their lives. The new state of South Sudan is due to officially become independent on 9 July, extending the family of states in our world. The starting conditions are as bad as can be conceived, and much has, of course, been said about this already. 70% of the population live as nomadic cattle farmers; 80% are illiterate; the dispute over Abyei is widening into a military conflict. There have already been deaths and woundings. As if that were not enough, the rivalries between the tribes and armed groups in South Sudan are also on the rise, and observers estimate that more than a thousand people have already lost their lives since January. The wounded and violated are hardly even counted. Sudan was a failed state. There is a danger that the state of South Sudan will be a failed state from the very outset. I am of the firm conviction that, given the colonial history of these countries, Europe has a major obligation to this region. Together with the United Nations and the African Union, this situation calls for Europe ’ s common foreign policy, and it is also that policy ’ s chance to prove itself. This is not only about money, but also about supporting the frail and nascent civil society. We need to negotiate hard with those who hold the future of the country in their hands, namely, the tribal chiefs and the heads of the military groups, so that they do not dash the hopes of the people of their country.	
en.20110608.27.3-723-000.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr Bartolozzi for having made Mongolia the subject of a debate in the European Parliament by taking the initiative for this question. While various aspects of the former Soviet states of Central Asia have been dealt with in Parliament, Mongolia and its situation have received very little attention. Quite unjustifiably so, for as a state of the former communist bloc, Mongolia exploited its independence at a very early stage and embarked upon a path of democratising its society. Mongolia came up with a democratic constitution as far back as 1992 and since then, a number of elections have taken place, which, according to observers, have generally been held democratically and correctly – which can by no means be taken for granted in the states of this region. For some years, the Mongolian Government has been trying to fight corruption through the law and, in 2010, it passed a moratorium on the death penalty, something that even some major democratic states have not yet managed. Nonetheless, the three million people who live in this extensive country with its extreme climatic conditions are suffering the consequences of a process of transformation that is still under way. The population of the country – until now still overwhelmingly nomadic in lifestyle – is flocking to the few towns, which do not have the infrastructure to cope. The country ’ s mineral resources are not being exploited in an environmentally sound way. Energy problems make civil and economic life more difficult. Squeezed between its large neighbours of Russia and China, the threat is that Mongolia will become even more dependent on these states than previously. The efforts and the successes of Mongolia – and here I see the glass as being half full, not half empty – in democratising its society should be recognised, because they set an example to the rest of the region and show what can be achieved despite a difficult past. Mongolia should continue to receive our support, not just in the context of aid programmes, but by the European Union having a direct presence in the Mongolian capital through a separate delegation, as a sign that Europe is not indifferent to the fate of Mongolia; European interests should not continue to be looked after by a delegation in Beijing. I very much regret the fact that the Conference of Presidents was not prepared to emphasise this further by approving a parliamentary resolution.	
en.20110608.3.3-012-000.wav	Mr Hartong, of course I recognise this right. I only hope that you also recognise that the position of the Dutch Government cannot simply be handed down ex cathedra, but that it should be debated in a multinational democracy. I have absolute respect for Mr Rutte, who is in favour of a 2.7% increase in the EU budget. I have taken note of this and am pleased that you have listened attentively because the positions of all governments are debated openly in this Parliament. To this extent, I failed to understand the meaning of your question, but what I believe I can glean from it is that you also support democracy. I suppose that this represents some sort of progress.	
en.20110609.5.4-065-000.wav	Madam President, firstly, the reason why I reacted so strongly is that I am still annoyed that we have not managed to adopt a joint resolution on safety, because it was more important for some people to take up an absolutist position rather than to find common ground. Secondly, I explained during the debate and I will explain once again that I have learned a lesson from this. I now realise that we need to do more to introduce tougher safety standards for European nuclear power stations. We need to exert more pressure and show more initiative. This is why I supported the joint resolution and this is why I am in favour of supporting Mr Oettinger and not constantly attacking him.	
en.20110623.5.4-074-000.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the intermediate category, I would definitely also have been able to imagine other solutions in the beginning, Mr Pieper, for example a transitional regulation for the regions which have received the highest levels of subsidies until now and which will no longer do so after 2013. However, it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions, in particular those hit by the crisis. We are currently talking about 51 regions. When confronted with so many regions that have been affected, it would be negligent not to establish an intermediate category. This is the only way in which we can create a reliable framework for providing responsible subsidies to these regions which have to compensate for their slow progress in development themselves. In other respects, Mr Pieper ’ s report contains a great deal of light and shade. Among other things, we are critical of the fact that there is no clear commitment to a much more decisive approach to combating poverty. We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation. It goes without saying that cohesion policy must remain an instrument for social balance and solidarity throughout all the regions.	
en.20110623.5.4-099-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of interregional cooperation will continue to grow in future. Cross-border collaboration and macro-regional cooperation are immensely important for the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives in a Europe which is becoming more cohesive. Border regions are still faced with particular challenges. Cross-border concepts and projects in areas such as infrastructure, business cooperation, research collaboration, the development of the labour market and training act as the engine for large parts of the European Union. We need clear, simple structures for interregional projects. Different national requirements for the project partners often make cooperation and the implementation of specific, sustainable projects more difficult. The call in Mr Pieper ’ s report to extend the proportion of interregional cooperation, Objective 3, to 7% is an important step forward and I strongly support this.	
en.20110705.38.2-620-000.wav	. Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, after almost three years of very hard work, far more than 3 000 amendments, countless conversations, discussions and debates, highly complex technical negotiations and political trialogues, we have reached the stage of voting on the political package, the major compromise between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on the future labelling of food. This regulation is intended to give consumers more and better information about food, in order to allow them to make informed purchasing decisions. That is not all, however. It should also benefit the European food industry by providing more legal certainty, less red tape and better lawmaking. This is particularly important for the small and medium-sized businesses which make up more than 80% of the food industry in the European Union. At the same time, this labelling must be appropriate for every type of food and non-alcoholic drink, from basic foods to highly processed ready meals. This is why mandatory labelling using the traffic light system is not possible, because it is not suitable for basic foods. Despite all the difficulties, despite all the political and ideological differences in Parliament and despite all the self-interested nationalism in the Member States, we have managed to reach a respectable compromise. Information about allergenic substances will be immediately obvious. The plants used to produce vegetable oils will be specified. There will be country of origin labelling for pork, poultry, lamb and goat meat. An impact assessment will be carried out for other products to show whether and how the origin can be specified, for example, for milk and dairy products, single ingredients, in other words, products made from one main ingredient, meat in processed foods and so on. Imitation foods must be clearly labelled as such on the front of the packaging. The same applies to reconstituted meat and fish which is formed from small pieces. In addition, packaging must not give the impression that it contains something which is not there. If there is a picture of fruit on a yoghurt pot, the yoghurt must contain fruit, not just colouring and aromas. In addition, the most important nutrients must be stated, but always per 100 grams or 100 millilitres in order to allow comparisons to be made. The label must also state whether water has been added to meat, the date on which meat and fish was first frozen and many other important details. However, the most important point is that all the information must be legible. We have defined legibility and we have specified a minimum font size and called on the Commission to introduce binding regulations for other factors, such as the contrast between the text and the background. At the same time, we have protected the handcrafted food production sector from excessive costs and red tape. Information about allergenic substances must be provided for fresh, non-prepacked foods, but not the nutrient information which can only be obtained by means of costly analyses. The Commission originally wanted this nutrient information to appear, but this would have led to the disappearance of national and regional specialities and would have resulted in standardised European pap, which is why we have ensured that it does not happen. Now we have all come to an agreement and the reputable consumer protection organisations are very satisfied with what has been achieved. I would like to thank everyone involved, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and, in particular, Mr Dalli for his explanations, which I hope he will soon pass on to us and with which he succeeded in cutting the Gordian knot in our political debates. I would especially like to thank the Hungarian Presidency which has achieved something that we had almost given up on, the equivalent of squaring the circle, and that is an agreement on this regulation.	
en.20110705.41.2-749-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Grabarczyk, I would like to join with previous speakers in thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ayala Sender. As has already been mentioned, the Council has been blocking progress on this dossier since 2008 and we only succeeded in reaching a compromise under the Belgian Presidency. The improved sharing of data between the Member States should, as has been said, make it possible in future to prosecute various traffic offences across national borders. Our main priority must be to improve road safety and to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the roads. Together with the own-initiative report by Mr Koch on road safety, which contains a series of very specific proposals, the repressive nature of this directive will help to ensure that the rules are followed. I do not need to go into these rules in detail because they have already been described here in positive terms. Changing the legal basis of European traffic policy to ensure police cooperation has finally enabled the Council to adopt a common position. However, the result of this has been that some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, have been excluded. This means that once again we do not have equality for all European citizens. Citizens must understand what rights they have with regard to data protection. We have attempted to make the rules in this area more stringent, so that access to the data that is collected and transmission and storage of the data are all regulated as strictly as possible. We were also very concerned about the information. Although the current text does not fully live up to Parliament ’ s expectations, I am still optimistic, because I believe that this is the first step in the right direction. I hope that we will be able to continue building on this foundation over the next few years in order to move towards further harmonisation of European traffic regulations. The revision clause inserted by Parliament should make this possible. I very much regret the fact that this report has ended up in the midst of the institutional conflict between the Council and Parliament about the correlation tables. During the trialogues we agreed that the joint statement on this subject would help us to find an overall compromise. I would very briefly like to remind everyone that tomorrow the European Association …	
en.20110926.16.1-039-000.wav	Madam President, Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Matias for this report and to our fellow Members who prepared the earlier reports, Ms Merkies and Ms Carvalho. This is a continuing process, and the day is approaching when we not only take political decisions here, but also have to demonstrate that we mean business when we say that research and innovation are crucial for the future viability of the European Union. I am therefore very grateful that the representative of the Committee on Budgets also mentioned that adequate funding in this area is an important issue. We will shortly have to settle the dispute as to whether we have the power to make available the financial resources that are necessary to give this area of research and innovation a truly central importance. This is of key importance for the question of whether and how Europe will develop in future. Then, I might add, all the fine and grandiose soapbox speeches will not suffice. Instead, facts will need to be provided. The second comment that I would like to make is that we ourselves – and this point is developed very nicely in the report – will not be able to avoid looking very closely at whether we cannot use the resources that we have more effectively. How can we simplify the procedure? How can we achieve speed? How can we make research funding more effective? How can we obtain a stronger structure and greater simplification in what are sometimes still a confusing labyrinth of different types of research funding. Sometimes, less is more. Few projects but a lot of money invested will have a greater effect in the end. I am therefore grateful that we have taken things a step further once again with this report. Of course, the European Research Council and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology will have a particular role to play, and the area of small and medium-sized enterprises is clearly also an important one. However, last but not least, we must also have a solution for those States that have not yet got very far with regard to the promotion of excellence, which must be extremely compelling and also remain the only principle in future. The idea of a possible competition with which we could perhaps boost new cutting-edge research centres in neighbouring regions also appears in this report. This is an important issue that still needs to be resolved.	
en.20110926.21.1-183-000.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the present exceptional situation as a result of the financial, economic and budgetary crisis, decisions at European level should concentrate on urgent and important matters. That is the only way to rebuild our citizens ’ trust in the sincerity of our actions. My report deals with the strategy to prevent untold human suffering as a result of around 35 000 deaths and more than 1.5 million, often serious, injuries every year as a result of road accidents and to prevent the associated economic damage of EUR 130 billion a year. The number of deaths alone corresponds to what we would see if 250 fully occupied, medium-sized scheduled aircraft were to crash. Would we not do everything in our power to prevent that? The costs resulting from accidents exceed the European Union ’ s total annual budget by a considerable amount. I am therefore certain that it will be to our advantage to take long-term action in this area. Thanks to the constructive cooperation of all shadow rapporteurs and many fellow Members we have succeeded for the first time with this report in drawing up a uniform, integrated, coherent approach to improving road safety. It takes into account the content of the UN Road Safety Charter 2010 to 2020 as well as the content and objectives of the road safety work done by the EU Member States and broader groups in civil society. For the first time, it contains ambitious, but realistic, objectives for the period up to 2020, with the ‘ vision zero ’ for the period after that. Thus, the aim is to reduce the number of fatal accidents by 50%, although those involving children by as much as 60%, and to reduce the number of people seriously injured by 40%. That is very much in the interests of every single one of our citizens, but also of our economy. To the Member States, we recommend adapting the targets and methods to their territory and we expect them to produce their own road safety action programmes. Secondly, the report specifies who is responsible for the individual activities and measures. This is by no means just the European Union. In the spirit of subsidiarity, the integrated approach means that the Member States, undertakings with regional or municipal responsibilities, indeed even each individual road user also has to take responsibility in terms of their duty of cooperation. Thirdly, the report states how – in other words with which instruments, activities and measures – the objectives are to be met. Legislative proposals at European level are just one strategy. We cannot, and do not wish to, do without guidelines, recommendations and instructions. In this regard, particular attention must be given to the principle of subsidiarity, which means that areas of responsibility are clearly specified, including where responsibilities are split. We value the diverse activities of the Commission. However, as they emanate from many different Directorates General, such as Mobility and Transport, Economic and Financial Affairs, Environment, Communication, Research and Innovation, Internal Market and Services and others, they are not always coherent, are often uncoordinated and sometimes they contradict one another. Therefore, we propose that a Road Safety Coordinator be appointed within the European Commission. In the long term, that will avoid the establishment of an agency for road safety and increase the efficiency of the European Commission enormously. Both the choice of measures and their evaluation require a scientifically sound approach based on comparable, high-quality data, definitions and statistics. We are therefore calling, among other things, for a harmonised analysis of the causes of injuries and accidents and the EU-wide exchange of data, whilst maintaining stringent personal data protection standards. We have identified six main areas for action. They concern people as road users, the road traffic rules, vehicles, infrastructure, the smart networking of vehicles and infrastructure and particular consideration for vulnerable road users. I ask for your support tomorrow.	
en.20110926.21.1-187-000.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yes indeed, we should concentrate on urgent and important matters in connection with road safety. I am firmly convinced of that, and in my opinion that means first and foremost the two greatest reducers of attentiveness while driving, namely alcohol and excessive speed. The European Union must also say something in this regard and not merely propose technical measures, which, although good in my opinion, are a long way from being adequate. In towns and cities in particular, lack of attentiveness – the problem of inattentive drivers – is particularly dramatic. Therefore, the speed must be lowered here. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that there was a broad majority in favour of the recommendation for a 30 km / h speed limit. Particular consideration must be given – this is also contained in the report, and I consider it to be important and positive – to finally focusing our attention on vulnerable road users, and I hope that these measures will at last, once and for all, actually be implemented.	
en.20110928.23.3-400-000.wav	Mr President, it is probably pointless, but I would like to issue him with an invitation. I have never seen him at the discussions on Rio or on other major worldwide conferences, but I always hear him talking here in plenary. I would really like to invite the honourable Member to come along to committee some time. Come and argue with us, tell us what you have to offer and then we can talk further with you about the speeches. The speech that you have just given gives us nothing to work with.	
en.20110929.4.4-066-000.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed comments. However, these detailed statements do not answer the questions that were put. The point of the questions was to ask whether it has been ensured that results will be achieved quickly. The industries that we want to exclude from these additional burdens, or in which we want to bring about fair conditions, need planning certainty. That is why we need decisions to be made soon. We need rapid decisions that can be relied on and we also need clear statements from the Commission. This process has already been extremely drawn out. We were all aware that it is a highly complex process that we have embarked upon, but when we accepted the compromise on the Emissions Trading Directive, we said that a condition of our acceptance was that relief would be provided for those European industries that were excessively burdened as a result, because otherwise they would not be able to compete with other areas of the world. I expect the basis upon which we acted at the time, the grounds for the decision in Parliament, with the Council and the Commission, to be realised as intended. I am slightly worried that, along the way, the group of industries concerned is getting smaller and smaller, that – if I may say so – our perspective is getting meaner and meaner, that more and more areas are being excluded. We are not just talking about steel; the aluminium industry is also affected – you know that – along with many other areas, such as chemicals and so on, and we are talking about the fact that what was the political basis for the decision at the time is not being implemented in practice. As you rightly pointed out, Commissioner, the situation of industries in Europe has not got any easier since this decision; rather, it has got more difficult. We are in a completely new situation and competition is much fiercer. We all struggling with it and giving fine speeches here about how these industries are very important for the future development of Europe. There were more smart speeches given here yesterday. I expect – Parliament expects – that what was agreed then will now be implemented, for the benefit of the industries – no, not the industries, but rather the people who work in these enterprises, for jobs and thus for Europe ’ s future opportunities.	
en.20110929.5.4-105-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Tavares, do you know of any examples that would actually justify the expense of spending many millions – billions in fact – on developing these body scanners? Are there examples showing that they have resulted in an increase in security?	
en.20111025.31.2-629-000.wav	Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Mleczko for his very clear description of the current situation. We have constantly heard in this debate that it is all about improving the position of working women who decide to have a child. In my opinion, the directive is focusing too closely on increasing maternity leave to 20 weeks. Do we really believe that the decision to have a child can be reduced to an issue such as 20 weeks ’ maternity leave? As the mother of three children, I am very well aware that it is important to have overall packages and good provisions in place for families, in order to have a positive influence on the decision to have a child and to create equal opportunities for women. The current draft directive does not even come close to doing justice to the different provisions and overall packages in some Member States, some of which are very good. We need flexible solutions which take into consideration the situation in the Member States and in society and the resulting needs of women. Maximum requirements and wish lists will not resolve the problem in this case. Therefore, we in Parliament firstly need to establish a sound, realistic basis for negotiations. Comprehensive maternity benefits and the welfare of children must be given the highest priority. We can ensure that this is the case using different methods and models. People who are intent on getting their own way regardless will not necessarily achieve their objectives more quickly. A lack of willingness to compromise does not open doors or build bridges. A moderate proposal would be a better solution to providing improved maternity benefits and making progress in this area. I believe that we must start looking for another approach on the basis of the Commission ’ s draft directive which offers more flexibility for different concepts in individual Member States in order to significantly improve maternity benefits and protection for children in the first few months of life. This will not be possible with the current draft which has not had broad support, as some Members have made clear today. I would like to see a little more flexibility, more realism and a greater focus on what the Member States have already achieved, without calling our basic requirement into question.	
en.20111025.32.2-653-000.wav	Madam President, Mr Šemeta, I would like to make a few comments on the tax agreement between Germany and Switzerland, as other speakers have done. Instead of stopping tax evasion and blocking the loopholes for tax evaders, which would have been sensible, the result that has been produced here is a Swiss cheese full of large holes. The proposed transition period of five months gives tax evaders plenty of time to transfer their money from Switzerland to other tax havens. As foundations and trusts are not governed by the agreement, it is also possible to transform assets which have been stashed away in Switzerland into the assets of a foundation. Forms for doing this can be obtained from Swiss banks. Tax investigators in Germany have recently received information about a number of tax evaders who have hidden their assets away in Switzerland. The agreement gives these people an amnesty and the tax investigators can no longer use the information that has been made available to them. What sort of agreement is it that restricts the activities of tax investigators? An advertising video produced by Swiss banks says about this agreement that customers will benefit even more in future from the values of Switzerland as a financial centre. The agreement obviously not only lacks the necessary coordination at EU level, but also counteracts the efforts of the EU to bring more transparency into tax issues, to make the collection of tax in the Member States more efficient and, above all, to combat and to prevent tax fraud. Therefore, this agreement is, in our view, not acceptable. We are calling on the EU to oppose it, if there is any doubt.	
en.20111026.14.3-143-000.wav	. Mr President, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of this House and with the agreement of the groups, I request that this matter be referred back to committee.	
en.20111026.22.3-340-000.wav	Madam President, I am pleased that, with the report by Ms Angelilli, we have together succeeded in initiating a strong, effective directive, and I would like to thank Ms Angelilli for this. The directive represents a significant step forward in the fight against child abuse. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of crimes still take place within children ’ s immediate social environment. The perpetrators are to be found within their families, in their schools and among their acquaintances. In this regard, we are still at the start of our work to raise awareness. Therefore, our children need to be made strong – strong enough to have the courage to confide in someone close to them in an emergency, but also strong enough to recognise dangers such as grooming when using the Internet. Together, we must therefore ensure that a sense of responsibility plays a greater role when it comes to the use of media in the education of our children. In this regard, the provision of information is of major importance, as many teachers and parents do not know what it is possible to do with their children ’ s computers or mobile phones. There is a great deal of catching up to do in this area. It is therefore to be welcomed that this report also attaches a great deal of importance to prevention, as the authorities, but also schools and families, need to do everything they can to prevent these sorts of dreadful crimes from happening in the first place. As a result, the EU also needs better strategies for negotiating with third countries, such as the US and Russia. Websites hosted outside the EU can only be quickly and effectively deleted if we also cooperate closely with these countries in the hunt for the perpetrators and, together, send out a clear signal criminalising the sexual abuse of children. Up to now, once the perpetrator has been caught, the legislator has, unfortunately, often been surprisingly lenient and most of the penalties have been suspended sentences. The seriousness of the offence must be given greater consideration in future. Overall, however, it is important for the public debate to continue, as there are many different dimensions to this issue. Prevention, the protection of victims, technical development, the principle of deletion rather than blocking, case law, the provision of information and intensive scientific documentation of the facts must also continue to be pursued after the vote tomorrow. Under no circumstances can we just sit back and relax. Instead, we need to accept the call to action for us all – every one of us – and work to achieve prevention and the provision of information.	
en.20111026.3.3-042-000.wav	Mr President, for years, the size of the EU budget has been hovering at more or less the same level. In that time, the responsibilities of the EU have continually expanded and the need for finance has increased significantly. Thus, financial market supervision made it necessary to establish new institutions. However, in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks effectively, these institutions need adequate financial resources. As a result of the financial and banking crisis, the economic weaknesses of some Member States of the EU have become clear. A comprehensive economic recovery plan would be needed to strengthen the economies of these countries. Some economic experts even talk of the need for a Marshall Plan for the crisis-stricken Member States. The EU does not need austerity programmes that impair growth; instead it needs a growth-promoting spending programme that will safeguard jobs and incomes for workers and young people in the EU. Yet what does the Council do in this situation? It curtails the Commission ’ s proposal, which already falls far short of what is needed. If an appropriate increase in the budget is not feasible in the current political climate, Parliament and the Commission should at least do everything they can to ward off the cuts proposed by the Council.	
en.20111115.5.2-031-000.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, particularly now, in a period of crisis, it is becoming clear what kind of European Union we really want. Do we want a union where the glue that binds us together is our conviction that people in the Member States of the European Union should not be forced to live in poverty? Do we believe that we have a joint responsibility for combating poverty and social exclusion? Or are we choosing a union like the one just outlined by the Members from the far-right group in Parliament? Sometimes, I think that the attitude of the Member States and, in particular, of some of their governments is bringing us dangerously close to the vision of the European Union that has just been formulated by those on the extreme right-wing. This means not doing anything jointly or putting in place any joint instruments or indicators. Wherever possible, the wording is vague. This is made very, very clear in many of the points in the report. I believe that we need to take a much stronger approach. We need to bring an immediate end to the sell-off of public assets and of social security systems. We need minimum social and environmental standards. This winter, we must not allow people to be thrown out on the street, or deported, or ultimately even to freeze to death, because of rising energy prices. We have a joint responsibility in this respect, in other words, the responsibility of the European Union. We must stand up for this and not for the nationalist claptrap that we have heard from those on the right.	
en.20111116.5.3-036-000.wav	Mr President, what would we have advised our fellow parliamentarians in 1931 or 1938, when we were in the Depression, when the financial markets had already annulled the democracies – and when we were heading for war? Two things would be necessary, two emergency measures: we need something like a transitional arrangement. Do what you have to do and do it quickly. Do not allow yourselves to be slowed down. Regulate every product, every institution and every player, as Chancellor Merkel has said. However, a transitional arrangement implementing the fiscal emergency programme cannot, on its own, have a future without an emergency programme for democracy. In this case, what this means is that we clearly do need a new European community, we clearly do need different treaties and we clearly do need an opus that works but that is legitimate and acquires legitimacy through referendums. We would have to begin the campaign for this now that the situation has become so dramatic that there must be a serious rethink before the Right, before the national splitters, again get the upper hand in relation to something that had actually already been established.	
en.20111214.26.3-333-000.wav	Madam President, there is no doubt that this House supports transparency and openness towards citizens. Obviously, my group, the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats), does so, too. However, this report goes way beyond the actual goal. Existing legislation and interinstitutional agreements are ignored and the protection of competition cases and sensitive and personal data is treated with contempt. Among other things, this massively violates data protection, which we so vehemently support in other contexts. Are we now to sacrifice the privacy of the global population? This is precisely the risk we face with this report, because administrative procedures and decisions, which also include personnel matters, for example, are to be made public. The same applies to the protection of business secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court cases and competition cases. With its definitions that are vague, far too broad and lacking in clarity, the report also allows public access to these types of documents, as documents are taken to mean any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. Even information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, will have to be made public. Do you really know what that means, Mr Cashman? It means public access to procedures. It means public influence on the decision-making process. In that case, we might just as well sit the lobbyists at the table and let them negotiate! Is that what citizens want? I cannot believe that that is the case. In addition, documents relating to non-legislative procedures – measures dealing with internal organisation and so on – are also to be made public. Where is the public interest in that? Is this not more likely to obstruct our work? This report is not in the interests of our citizens. It will result in a flood of useless information. It will make our work impossible and, above all, it is unacceptable to the other institutions because it contravenes current legislation. You are aware of that, Mr Cashman, and by doing this you are essentially working against greater transparency and against the citizens.	
en.20111214.28.3-428-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to such an important and far-reaching subject as the White Paper on the future of transport, the risk is always great that we will end up with something that looks like a Christmas tree with everyone attempting to get two or three of their favourite subjects included. If we look at the result, which we will vote on tomorrow, then we can, without a doubt, congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Grosch. From several hundred amendments, he succeeded in producing a sound, coherent and comprehensible result that places the main focus as regards transport of the future on safety, environmental protection, energy and technology. I expressly welcome the fact that such important issues as the social, health and labour law-related conditions of the employees have been suitably mentioned here. This is particularly important in view of the threat of a shortage of workers in the transport sector, which is something we must actively do something about if we want to prevent bottlenecks for well-trained workers in the future. There is a further opening up of cabotage in road transport only on condition that social dumping and unfair conditions are prevented. I also welcome the fact that improving road safety is considered an important aspect here. The safety of our roads is a subject that we need to concern ourselves with more in the future, too. There are other aspects that I view in a more critical light. Thus, I would have liked there to have been a statement regarding modal shift in order to shift more traffic from the roads to the railways and waterways. For this reason, I think the discussion regarding gigaliners is not the best solution for increased sustainability. Equally worthy of criticism is the further liberalisation of the railway sector, and we ought to wait and give the matter further consideration before opening up national passenger transport. We still have to carry out some technical harmonisation in this area and to establish fair competition conditions. However, as I said, I hope that this report, which expresses the expectations of Parliament, will not remain a pious wish-list, but that we will achieve our goal by 2020 and our proposals will have been put into practice.	
en.20111214.30.3-499-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was exactly 20 years ago that the Central Asian states received their national independence as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Emerging from a dictatorship, the development of democratic structures and the rule of law in these states remains a constant challenge. Nevertheless, on account of their rich deposits of mineral resources and raw materials, these states are important trading partners for the EU and its Member States. It is therefore only logical to regulate the EU ’ s relations with these states within the framework of partnership and cooperation agreements. Partnership and cooperation agreements should facilitate cooperation and lead to the two parties trading as partners, but not to unilateral stigmatisation. Child labour, and particularly forced child labour, is an evil that, unfortunately, is prevalent in many countries of this world and must be combated. However, I would ask you to consider the fact that in many European regions dominated by agriculture, it was common for the school holidays to be extended for the children during harvest time in order to allow children from farming families to help out with the harvest, which is something that no one would describe as forced labour today. However, should there be indications that forced child labour is being used in the cotton harvest in Uzbekistan, then the appropriate action must be taken. The same action must then be taken for all other states in which there is still child labour, even for those states where we are pursuing economic interests on a completely different scale, like India or China. We must not apply double standards here.	
en.20111214.5.3-038-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with all of those who have congratulated the Council Presidency. Not only were you an honest broker during a difficult time; you were also a European broker. That was very nice to see during these difficult times in which we are seeing political trends in a number of Member States that suggest to the people that it would be possible to achieve more alone than together. You focused on what unites us. It was also very refreshing to see that, with this clear European agenda, you also received the support of the people in Poland on domestic policy matters. That was not particularly easy in this context. Therefore, I have the highest respect for what you have achieved. In this six-month period, we were also able to get a few things under way in the area of financial market regulation. Allow me to highlight just one area in which I was able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed, and where, thanks to the Polish Presidency, we did succeed in imposing sanctions against a highly speculative instrument and, where necessary, prohibiting it, so that we could help to bring greater stability to the financial markets. I would particularly like to thank your Finance Minister and the Secretary of State, who got this off the ground during a difficult discussion process between Parliament and the Council. That is an example that shows that we can do something together in the interests of security and stability in Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks for that.	
en.20111214.6.3-077-000.wav	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new surveillance mechanism for economic imbalances has been in force since yesterday. The detailed regulations are also now available. What developments does the Commission now see as dangerous and what economic problems do you want to see rectified? Increases in unit labour costs in the euro area countries in excess of 3% per year are considered by the Commission to be a problem. A limit value for falling wages is not provided for, however. I would say to the Commission that ‘ cheap ’ is not the same thing as ‘ good ’. It is not enough to condition the Member States to achieve prosperity at the expense of their trading partners. Without investment in education, health and energy efficiency, we can exploit our workers to the bone, but that will not enable us to write an economic success story. I would like to mention one more example from the scoreboard: the loss of export market share should be examined and penalties imposed. That is nonsense. In the face of increasing world trade, Europe ’ s share will, statistically speaking, inevitably shrink. Consequently, this indicator will penalise those countries that are already closely involved in world trade. We therefore believe that the Commission should withdraw this scoreboard and subject it to a general overhaul.	
en.20111215.5.4-087-000.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to join in thanking our rapporteur and all those who worked on the report because this is certainly not a routine task, even if this is the fortieth time we have dealt with competition policy on the basis of a report from the Commission. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive presentation – 2010 was, of course, the first year in which you had full responsibility for competition policy. Turning to something you mentioned yourself, I would like to ask that some practices in the area of public aid in the banking sector should be eradicated because the new stress tests required by the European banking supervision system indicate a need for further recapitalisation for the banks. I do not believe that it will contribute anything to the stability of the banking system if we still have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand, while new cases are being created on the other because pressure is increasing to raise the equity capital quota accordingly, particularly in the area of private banks. Hence my urgent plea to you, Commissioner, to find a swift solution that will help stabilise the banking sector so that it can withstand the challenges of the international environment. The second major issue, the control of mergers, will continue to concern us increasingly in the years ahead. Here, too, I can only urge you to continue on the clear and transparent path taken by the Commission to date within the framework of merger control. It is in the interests of all involved, particularly the consumer, that we should ensure that competition is possible in the area of merger control, whether in larger or other structures, which is not for me to judge. With this in mind, I would like to thank all those who have been involved. I hope, Commissioner, that we will find a solution soon, particularly in the banking sector.	
en.20120118.25.3-351-000.wav	. Madam President, Commissioner, you have, I believe, just hit the nail on the head, in that we all recognise that we are capable of starting a third industrial revolution in Europe if we truly understand that we need to see sustainability as an industrial opportunity. You also mentioned resources and that reminded me of something that I completely forgot about today. I completely forgot about the human resources in my office. Ms Philipp, if I may say so, you have worked extremely hard on this with marvellous results. You played an absolutely key role in this matter. For that, I would very much like to thank you.	
en.20120213.15.1-074-000.wav	Mr President, freedom of speech in Parliament requires a working microphone system. The button for switching on my microphone is broken. May I request that a technician restores my freedom of speech?	
en.20120213.19.1-158-000.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished that we need to keep reminding people of what is meant by structural and cohesion policy. Structural and cohesion policy is one of the key policy areas of the European Union and, by definition, it should serve the purpose of consolidating the economic and social cohesion of the Union, while at the same time promoting growth and employment, in underdeveloped regions in particular. The necessity and success of structural and cohesion policy has been demonstrated especially clearly in these years of crisis. The economic development situation in many regions would now be even bleaker had these funds not been made available. Then comes the implementation of Structural Funds on the basis of operational programmes – as has already been pointed out – in which the promotional strategy of each region is described. The European Union, Member States and regions work in partnership here and thus create real added value for Europe. The success of structural and cohesion policy is based on the reliability of programming and funds which have either already been made available or are in the process of being made available. I am, therefore, very surprised that, time and again, some Member States, and even the Commission – as we now see – attempt to make use of Structural Fund resources as a money box for all kinds of topical policy initiatives. That is not consistent with the meaning and purpose of cohesion policy and, in addition, it causes concern amongst players in the regions who are already working to achieve objectives on the basis of long-term strategies and contracts. It is true that tackling youth unemployment and commitment to economic growth are important goals. However, they will only be achieved if the cooperative partnership between the regions, Member States and the Commission is maintained and if players in the regions continue to be involved. After all, only they know what needs to be done in their regions. Structural and cohesion policy is the unifying, cooperative, supportive bond of action between individual policy levels in the European Union. It reflects the solidarity of Europe on the ground, in the regions, and it should not be recklessly abandoned in favour of political quick fixes.	
en.20120214.19.2-343-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, I support the compromise reached in the trialogue, which is aimed at strengthening the negotiating position of dairy farmers in relation to the processing industry, much as I am aware that it does not solve all the problems that dairy farmers currently face in many Member States. Even 50 years ago, Commission President Sicco Mansholt envisaged preferential measures for the creation of producer communities within the framework of the common agricultural policy. In my country of Luxembourg, too, the dairy sector is the main pillar of our agricultural sector as a result of the high proportion of grassland. Our agricultural sector and our farmers long since understood that the best solution is to come together to form a cooperative that takes over the processing of the milk itself. It was for exactly this reason that, in the Council, five Member States voted against the compromise, which does not live up to the requirement of being a soft-landing instrument. The Commission has the right of initiative when it comes to proposing legislation, and I would therefore like to call on it to put a legislative proposal to the Council and Parliament this year in order to remedy this clear and costly fault in the system. A linear reduction up until 2015 in the super levy which is imposed on each litre of milk that exceeds the quota, or the abolition of the fat correction mechanism, could at least reduce the negative effects of the regulation, which is being phased out without detrimental impact on those Member States that are not affected. This dairy package is also the final report of the high level group that was to bring about a soft landing after the phasing out of milk quotas. It is astonishing that there is absolutely no mention of milk quotas in this report. Young and ambitious farmers in Luxembourg and four other Member States who are attempting to prepare for the deregulation of the milk market and aiming to expand their production in order to be able to keep up on the global market after 2015 can only do so by buying additional quotas now, even this close to the abolition of the milk quota system. This is an unnecessary and enormous additional capital cost which puts them at a disadvantage in comparison with farmers in the other 22 Member States.	
en.20120214.21.2-445-000.wav	Mr Langen, are you aware that we have had Community bonds for quite some time already? Are you, furthermore, aware that the resolution refers not simply to Eurobonds, but to a wide range of options? Are you also aware that not all of these options require treaty change? I find it questionable that you should have picked off generalities about Eurobonds alone once again. The very differentiation that we have achieved here thanks to Ms Goulard ’ s sound proposal is not something that we should give up again. I would like to hear a little more differentiation in your speeches and I am eager to hear what you have to say in that regard.	
en.20120214.21.2-456-000.wav	Ms Goulard, I will just say, briefly, that that is not a judgment that I have put forward here. I would just point out that the last government bonds issued by Italy before it joined the euro bore an interest rate of 10%. There was no outcry in Italy at the time. Nobody said that other countries should take on the debt. It was natural for Italy to pay high interest rates. Yet now, all of a sudden, because we have had low interest rates for 10 years and got up to our ears in debt, because money was cheap – for investments just as for the public purse – we want to prolong that through Eurobonds. That represents a trap from which we will not escape, and I stand by what I said.	
en.20120215.26.3-575-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, to be honest, your answer disappointed me a little. You obviously want to stick to the old system of complex negotiations with each country, which will again mean that there will be no greater access to literature, in other words, no further opportunities for the blind and visually impaired. I find this doubly sad because the European Union is now blocking a forward step in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), while many other partners to the treaty would be prepared to move forward. We are missing a huge opportunity here. You are not campaigning in favour of more rights for authors, but rather against people who are to be guaranteed equal access to cultural assets under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, so that they can also fully share in these cultural assets. I am calling on you to remove these barriers and to sign up to a binding treaty.	
en.20120216.5.4-030-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the debate in this House shows that we represent the entire spectrum of opinion: on the one side, we have those who do not want restrictions of any kind, while on the other are those who associate any form of immigration with the risk of a massive influx of people. These are the two extremes to be found within the House. Family reunification must be viewed with a great deal of common sense and rationalism. On the one hand, problems genuinely exist in Member States with excessively restrictive policies. After all, we cannot put so many obstacles in the way of reuniting families that, in the end, reunification becomes an impossibility. On the other hand, Member States are fully justified in demanding language skills and integration, for example, or at least a willingness to integrate within a state. Secondly, the Member States naturally have the right to point out the problems that arise with family reunification, problems that should not be swept under the carpet. If countries like Greece, Malta, Romania or Italy are no longer permitted to indicate the problems they experience in this context, then I am not certain that we are taking a democratic approach by simply ignoring problems. We do not need another new directive. We should debate the problems carefully and then consider how we can remedy them. The continuous production of new directives will not lead to an improvement in the directives or their implementation. We are currently experiencing implementation problems in some areas. I completely understand that we need to engage in debate first, rather than drawing up yet another new directive and adding something to it before we have thoroughly discussed the old directive and the associated problems. I am in favour of listening to the Member States and of respecting the basic right of family reunification. If this is done in a reasoned and understanding way, then we will also achieve some progress.	
en.20120314.26.3-492-000.wav	Mr President ‘ consider before you form an opinion ’ – that is what the Polish aphorist, Stanisław Jerzy Lec, demands, and it would also do us good to heed this recommendation sometimes here in Parliament. Only a few weeks after the resolution on a strategy for Central Asia was adopted here in this House, which sought to censure the states of Central Asia, we are now responding to events in connection with strikes in Zhanaozen in Kazakhstan without waiting for the outcome of the ongoing investigations that are being carried out with international involvement. As regrettable as the deaths are and as much as those who were injured and imprisoned during the course of these events have the right to a review of what happened, the reasons behind these events remain unclear. Thus, Vladimir Kozlov, leader of the unregistered opposition party, Alga, stated that ‘ it was a different group of people; the unrest was by no means in the interests of those who were striking, as it merely provided a reason for violence to be used against them ’. The Central Asia expert, Arkady Dubnov, also said: ‘ It cannot be ruled out that elements of the Kazakh opposition who live abroad will also get involved. On the other hand, maintaining the tensions could be very much in the interest of someone in the Kazakh capital, Astana. After all, Kazakhstan ’ s power elite are already fighting for the chance to become President Nursultan Nazarbayev ’ s successor ’. We had the opportunity here in Parliament to speak with the Kazakh opposition in the presence of the Kazakh ambassador. The UN Special Representative stated today that he is impressed by the attention that the Kazakh Government is giving to the events in Zhanaozen and that it is necessary to uncover the true facts behind the unrest. We ought to take the Kazakh authorities at their word and measure them by their actions, but we should not make premature, reflex judgments.	
en.20120329.3.4-013-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, if I have understood you correctly, Mr Rehn, what you have said today is that the Commission is fighting to ensure the continuation of the food programme for the most deprived people in the European Union. It will do everything in its power to put concrete proposals on the table in the near future concerning where exactly the programme will be based and how it will be financed. I believe that this is urgently needed and I think that we have a joint responsibility to ensure that the food programme becomes reality. This is not because I see it as a last resort, but because from my perspective, it sends out a signal that we still have a fundamental sense of solidarity with the day-to-day lives of those people in the European Union who, unfortunately, are not able to take part in any of the developments going on around them and who have become the first and most serious victims of the methods used by the European Union to combat the crisis. I am thinking about Greece, Spain and other countries where the measures that the European Union is taking are having the greatest impact on the poorest of the poor. We are sending out a signal but, unfortunately, it is no more than that. Therefore, I think we urgently need to put combating poverty at the top of our main agenda, and not just for the sake of the 18 million people in the European Union who are currently dependent on food aid. Until now, we have not sent out a clear enough signal. However, in my view, this is the decisive point if we want to continue to make progress and if we want the citizens of the European Union to have confidence in us to create a social Union with a strong sense of solidarity. In this respect, you have our support. However, ladies and gentlemen, we are also called upon to ensure that the governments which are currently blocking this programme adopt a different attitude. This is a personal commitment that we must make.	
en.20120418.21.3-353-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Daul, I listened carefully to what you said. What you are proposing – in other words, imposing a growth test on all expenditure alongside the subsidiarity test – means narrowing the objectives down to just growth. I would like you to tell me how you reconcile that with the manifesto of a Christian Democrat group which still has objectives that extend beyond growth.	
en.20120418.21.3-361-000.wav	Mr President, gentlemen, it is surely a well-known fact that the economy does not give birth to children. Neither does it bring up children, and it cannot provide children with a life in unspoilt nature. This would suggest that the Commission, and also the Council, needs to rethink its priorities; needs to reconsider. As a group, we will examine very carefully whether what you presented earlier today actually represents a shift in priorities. Until now, the motto has been to deal first with the economy, which needs functioning financial markets. That is why the first task was to balance national budgets – in other words, to reduce debt and keep the markets calm. Unfortunately, Mr Daul is not here now. I simply wanted to tell him that my response is exactly the same as that of Georges Marchais. I did not understand his answer, but nonetheless I would contradict him. The measures that were taken were incorrect. It was wrong to concentrate solely on getting the economy right, and in the process to disregard entirely what was happening to people. It was wrong to put the stability of the euro above all else and to say that we could not care less what became of people. It should be the other way round: we must deal first with the people, then we can talk about stabilising the euro. The speculative raids on Spain took interest rates on Spanish government bonds to above 6% or more, and thus close to the level at which other countries such as Greece, Portugal and even Ireland claimed assistance from the bail-out fund. The policy of austerity that has been forced on the Member States by the EU, the European Central Bank (ECB) and also by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with drastic cuts in public expenditure of all kinds, from reductions in wages and pensions to increases in value-added tax and much more, has increased the burden on citizens without even preventing the recent spiral. Rigorous cuts in public expenditure are exacerbating the downturn and driving up national debt – and we all need to acknowledge that. When Mr Draghi said recently that the European social model was finished, then I would like to hear you, Mr Barroso, say that the Commission does not think so. I would also expect you to go to Greece, to send your people to Greece, Portugal and Ireland, and to take careful note of what is going on there. What will happen to the people who are currently having to fight for survival? What are we jointly doing to break once and for all this vicious circle that has implanted itself precisely in the countries worst hit by the debt crisis? We simply cannot look on and do nothing. It is no use having social policy programmes that will start to have an effect sometime in the future, when other measures have already taken effect. We need to act now. What has become of your 2020 goals to eradicate poverty? What happened to the European poverty platform? It has been put on the back burner. That was before the crisis. It is now, however, in the midst of the crisis, that people need help and support – and that they need the European Union to act. They do not need empty promises. We need concrete ideas for what we can do now. If you do that, you will have the support of my group. Support all those – including those within the Commission – who have seen the signs of the times all too clearly and want to change things. Please do not simply carry on as you were and say it will happen anyway. If we carry on as we have been doing, there will be nothing left. I appeal to you to present an actual project, a programme for how we can really provide active help to the people in the countries affected right now. Do something for them. In our Member States, we need to do what is necessary to ensure that the funds for the European Stability Framework (ESF) 2013 or 2014-2020, or for the other programmes, are not blocked or cut. The Member States must shoulder their responsibilities.	
en.20120418.22.3-420-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the current situation as regards public finances and the economy in Europe, this is no time for fairy tales when it comes to tax policy. The situation in Council is quite simply that little progress is being made on tax policy proposals. Why is that? It is because some countries are opposed to further tax cooperation. They profit from aggressive tax planning; they are tax havens themselves. The Treaties clearly state that there must be unanimity on tax matters. That is why the Commission ’ s proposals have been shipwrecked on various occasions in the past. They are watered down, or no progress is made – as in the case of the directive on interest. Recent proposals have already been resigned to this and do not even suggest anything demanding any more. I would therefore ask you, Mr Šemeta – and I know your job is not an easy one where this is concerned – to change strategy, to present strict measures and go for enhanced cooperation in order to end the blockade in Council.	
en.20120418.26.3-559-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal concerning risk sharing instruments will certainly not succeed in preventing state bankruptcy in cases where such an eventuality is almost inevitable. Nonetheless, it is better to do something than to simply sit on our hands. Sometimes, unusual situations call for unusual measures. The budgetary and debt crisis in some countries has meant, unusually, that several important cohesion and structural policy projects and measures cannot be implemented because the banking sector is unable to provide backing and private investors are no longer available. I see the current proposal for establishing risk sharing instruments for the continued financing of structural policy projects as an extraordinary measure. The cohesion and structural policies available to the countries that wish to avail themselves of these risk sharing instruments can be used to secure those projects that are already ongoing. I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Ms Hübner, for making such a valuable contribution in tightening up the details of the Commission ’ s proposal, once again making it clear when and how these instruments are to be used. I also believe that these risk sharing instruments should only apply in the current situation and should not provide a precedent for the future subsidy period.	
en.20120419.19.4-460-000.wav	Madam President, our group supported the call at the time of the last amendment to the Biometric Passports Regulation in 2009 for a review to be carried out in three years ’ time and for four studies to be presented. One of the reasons that our group supported this was because it has expressed major concerns time and again on the grounds of data protection and also on account of the overestimation of the benefit of using biometric data in passports. The belief in the perfect form of identification, the overestimation of this method too, and – associated with this – the overestimation of other parts of the security chain are genuinely problematic. The use of biometric data is still subject to this major misconception, namely the assumption that these data are unchangeable and mostly reliable. That is absolutely not the case. These data are also subject to change throughout a person ’ s life. They differ between childhood and old age. We therefore need reliable and sound studies and conclusions. People are still busily forging these documents. We have now been able to establish this. As the incidents in the United Kingdom and other countries repeatedly demonstrate, the chips are definitely not safe from misuse. They are readily cracked and, for those concerned, this can result in permanent damage. The standards within the EU also differ widely. The error rate – as seen in France and the Netherlands – is very high. We need to ask ourselves again and again what benefit we get from biometric data if documents are falsified and enter into circulation. Thus, if one part of the chain is falsified and the ‘ breeder ’ documents are at variance, biometric data would no longer be of any help to us. The Chaos Computer Club in Germany needed a few minutes only to demonstrate the falsification of a chip. For this, the people of the Chaos Computer Club needed the cap of a plastic bottle, some superglue, a digital camera and a little wood glue, and in a few minutes they had cracked the chip. So much for supposed security. We are waiting for the Commission to present the studies and, of course, also the results and the lessons that can be drawn from them.	
en.20120419.20.4-514-000.wav	Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission is, unfortunately, not as adequately represented here today as I would have wished out of respect for Parliament. As a Member from a region that will be severely affected by the planned changes, namely the Eifel region, I am compelled to ask the question, having followed the debate very closely, whether the, sadly, somewhat inadequate attempt at standardising the criteria for less-favoured areas really will meet the needs in this region, especially as the information necessary to make a sensible and responsible decision is not available. Above all, I ask myself whether an adequate impact assessment was actually carried out. In order to be fair to farmers, we do not just need biophysical criteria; over and above these, we also need socio-economic criteria. I therefore call on the Commission to discuss the criteria once again, spending the necessary time on these important aspects, separate from the overall package of the common agricultural policy reform and, above all, after submission of the necessary documents and a careful analysis of the impact.	
en.20120419.23.4-584-000.wav	Madam President, I believe that we must attempt, in collaboration with the European Asylum Support Office and the Greek authorities, to identify which of the people who have come to Greece could possibly be transferred to other countries within the European Union, firstly, because they can definitely never return to their home country and, secondly, because they may have potential and qualifications which are appropriate and useful. However, this is essentially also about helping the Greeks to register and identify these people more quickly, so that help can be provided sooner and so that those people who do not have qualifications or the entitlement to live in Greece or the European Union can be returned to their home countries, because they do have the opportunity of remaining there.	
en.20120419.4.4-012-000.wav	. Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her dedicated and exemplary work. I agree with many of the criticisms expressed by Ms in 't Veld and have supported them in the past, in part at least. We always reach a point, however, where people need to take responsibility. On behalf of the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf I would state that we now need to deal with the realities of the situation, rather than taking recourse to ideological or theoretical positions. The fact is that the US has been gathering this PNR data for 10 years without a single complaint. It is also the case that none of us wants to put a stop to data traffic, even if we are not in favour of the agreement. You have just said so yourself. Nor do we want to bring air travel between Europe and the US to a standstill. The fact is also that the US has a right to know who enters its territory. In my opinion, it is also a fact that the legal services have all made oral indications that this agreement is better than the alternatives. This is the reason why we need people to take responsibility here. After all, that is what we have been elected to do. We need to take responsibility for our citizens, as otherwise they would be abandoned with little protection and few rights. We need to take responsibility for the airlines, as otherwise, as the Commissioner also pointed out, they would be left with absolutely no legal certainty. We also need to take responsibility for the EU as a contracting partner in questions of data protection and security, as well as responsibility for a good balance between security and data protection. Hence we are generally in favour of this agreement, even though it is by no means perfect. If we want to protect our citizens and offer them better data protection, then we also need to take responsibility here and vote in favour of this agreement.	
en.20120509.21.3-202-000.wav	Mr President, Mr De Gucht, your statement was very informative. Thank you very much. Sometimes, figures say more than words. Up to this point, as you have mentioned, the European Patent Office has granted almost 2 000 patents for plants and almost 1 200 patents for animals created with and without the use of genetic engineering. I would like to mention two prominent examples. The first is the approval of patents on barley which has been genetically modified and modified by breeding. This applies to the entire chain from the seed through to the plant and, therefore, affects both our farmers and our brewers, both producers and consumers. This example shows the devastating scope of the patenting processes. The second example concerns the so-called long-life tomato, which is not to be confused with the long-life oil in the engines of your diesel cars. The ploy used by the applicant, the US company Arcadia, enabled it to obtain a patent by circumventing current EU regulations. It was not the tomato that was patented, but its genetic material, in this case, selected enzymes. This shows the lengths that companies will go to, despite the fact that, as you have said, Mr De Gucht, Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions of 1998 clearly states: The following shall not be patentable: (a) plant and animal varieties; (b) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals. We are of the opinion that this definition should be made more precise. Technical processes used to support conventional breeding activities must not lead to patentability. We would like to make it quite clear that there must be no patents on life. We need to send out a clear signal that there needs to be a more ethical approach and greater honesty with regard to creation. I repeat: we are opposed to the patentability of life throughout Europe. Therefore, Mr De Gucht, we are calling for a clear statement from the Commission that patents on genetic material and genetic resources are, and will remain, banned. Secondly, we are calling for a clear position on Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: no patents on life. Thirdly, Mr De Gucht, on behalf of many farmers and breeders in Europe, we are calling for the breeders ’ and farmers ’ privilege to be clearly enshrined in all legislation.	
en.20120510.9.4-027-000.wav	Madam President, I would like to give you our opinion on the discharge of Europol and Eurojust. With regard to Europol, there is very little and, in fact, almost nothing, to find fault with. The annual accounts essentially reflect the financial situation in 2010, and all of the transactions that they are based on comply with the rules and are therefore also legal. The only things that stand out are the high carryovers compared with the accrued costs, which, overall, are actually low. Europol attributes this to the move to new headquarters, which is clearly understandable. However, Europol promises to take additional measures in future to avoid such high carryovers. In addition, Europol is committing itself to monitoring the implementation of the budget on a monthly basis from 2012 onwards. I recommend that we check whether that does actually happen. Against this background, I recommend that we grant discharge to Europol. Where Eurojust is concerned, the annual accounts also essentially reflect the financial situation in 2010. All of the transactions here are also legal and compliant with the rules. However, here too, a high level of operational expenditure was carried forward to 2011. Eurojust ’ s explanation for this was that it was mainly due to an Organisational Structural Review project – a new computer infrastructure and the costs related to data processing. The agency has stated that it will improve all of this in future, and that it will also improve its compliance with the tendering requirements. I recommend that we check this in future, too, and in particular, that we check whether all vacant posts are actually filled in future. This situation has improved. However, if these posts are not filled soon, we will have to consider cancelling some funding, and that would have a negative impact on Eurojust. I nevertheless recommend that we grant discharge.	
en.20120523.22.3-498-000.wav	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what should worry us and make us panic is not simply the sheer numbers of unemployed young people in Europe, but the way this is developing. Between 2008 and 2011, the number of unemployed young people rose by 26.5%, according to the International Labour Organisation. It is this development that necessitates urgent measures, for we are not only cutting off an entire generation from the labour market – we are cutting off an entire generation from a future worth living. If we allow our young people to feel completely useless, it is no wonder that young people are turning away from this EU because they have no reasonable prospect of work or life opportunities. I would really urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the measures decided on to counter this are initiated. I can see some things being done, but please ensure that the many years ’ of mental doldrums are not now replaced by a flurry of activity. When I read that the Commission is starting a programme under which young people will now be given financial assistance if they apply for a job abroad, then we are starting a migration circus that will not solve the problem. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive; because technicians, doctors, engineers and care workers will then be poached by the richer countries that are not in this crisis. In this crisis, which is the cause of this development, what we need are offensive measures; namely, the phasing out of this lunatic austerity that is stifling Europe ’ s economy. We need a targeted growth policy, we need a strengthening of domestic purchasing power, and public investments in education, research and alternative energies. That would be the right approach. Combined with European subsidies, it would then be possible actually to develop an integrated concept that creates some prospects for the lives of young people. I have one final comment to make, and that is that this youth unemployment cannot be reconciled with the nonsense about wanting to raise the retirement age to 70. We need a different policy here that allows young people access to the labour market. That is what I am urgently calling for.	
en.20120523.3.3-039-000.wav	Ms Swinburne, you just said that everything that is argued in favour of the financial transaction tax is speculation, but you followed this with some very speculative examples of your own. In the light of what you said, I should like to know what you think of these investigations that have been carried out by the Commission and the study carried out by the Commission, which establish very, very clearly that, by oversight, there has been too little consideration of the real economy ’ s dependence on the financial markets, that 95% of companies are not dependent on it in any way for raising funds, and that it is highly likely that any negative effect on growth that has been mentioned in the past could be turned into a positive by making appropriate public investments to promote growth. Do you see that as mere speculation, too, or would you say that such a well-based, broad study by the Commission is also well reasoned and forms a strong argument?	
en.20120523.3.3-046-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial transaction tax is certainly not identical to the Tobin tax that has been talked about and debated for many years, but I think it incorporates essential elements of the Tobin tax. It can at least be said to take on board the idea that the financial markets should participate in the tax system and, above all, should share in bearing the costs of the crisis. I think that sends a very important message to the financial markets. However, it is also an important message to send to our citizens, to our electorate. There have been a great many actions, petitions and written pleas to politicians in a wide range of Member States asking for a financial transaction tax to at last be introduced at European level. I believe that with the majority that we are seeing here in favour of this report and this tax, Parliament has achieved a major success. While it is undoubtedly not sufficient to stabilise and restrict the markets in the way that may be necessary, I feel it is a really important step that we are taking here. I would particularly like to urge the Council to take seriously the voices of our citizens, of our electorate, and to work towards this actually being introduced and not to block the introduction of this tax because of the British position or other positions. I think it is clear that the citizens of the European Union want this tax, and I think we have a great responsibility here. It is now up to the Council to take action on this, and I should like to use my speaking time to urge the Council to do everything it can to ensure that this tax is now actually introduced and becomes a reality.	
en.20120523.3.3-081-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all the problems relating to the details that we could talk about, and which we will be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in which, when everything is going well, the banks take the profits, and then, when something goes wrong, taxpayers have to pick up the tab. That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions. It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement. In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises with access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy. Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy. That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job. That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority.	
en.20120611.19.1-066-000.wav	Mr President, the reform of the generalised system of preferences (GSP) was very much necessary. It is a positive that there are now longer durations, and more certainties for exporters. The criteria are too imprecise, however, as the Committee on Development has already said. Unfortunately, the Commission is only interested in World Bank categorisation. In that connection, Parliament has been very critical in the past, and on repeated occasions, of the use of gross domestic product as the sole criterion. The definition of upper-middle income countries can apply to countries with a per capita GDP of USD 4 000, but also to those where it is up to USD 12 000. That is thus an enormous – and far too large – range, and it in no way does justice to the realities on the ground. We certainly do not object to countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait being removed. The reform to that end was good therefore. These countries, however, are high-income countries. Russia and China, on the other hand, are upper-middle income countries, but we certainly need not be concerned by their removal from the scheme either. Yet this category also includes much poorer countries, such as Namibia and Ecuador. Until now, the Commission had at least also applied the criterion of vulnerability, which covers countries that export little, or only a very small range of goods. That meant that it was possible to at least avoid the situation where countries that are dependent on fewer products and are thus very vulnerable are categorised too high. Why, then, has the Commission removed this criterion? It will mean the removal from the scheme of countries such as the Dominican Republic, Fiji, Gabon and Botswana, even though their economies fit the criterion of vulnerability. Why did the Commission not retain the old criteria, which were, in any case, already inadequate? It raises the suspicion that the Commission wants to force poorer countries into free trade agreements that are unfavourable to them. The preference system, however, is an instrument to promote development and cannot be replaced by pure trade instruments, in which the path of a country or a region to development no longer plays any role. Fortunately, my fellow Members will still have the chance in plenary to vote in favour of our amendment, which incorporates vulnerability as a criterion. The new arrangements will also mean, however, that trade regions will be dismembered. Neighbouring countries in customs unions will soon have to follow different rules when exporting to the EU. This absolutely does not reflect our objective of promoting regional integration. Instead of individual countries, the Commission should be giving greater consideration to development regions. Here, too, we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance have tabled an amendment, which I hope will meet with a great deal of support. It is also problematic for countries that one day were still benefiting from the GSP only to then find themselves outside the programme the next day. There need to be transitional periods, and we can see from our own Member States that just a few months are not enough for economic development. Ultimately, we MEPs have to consider, for all legislative proposals, whether we focus just on speed and want to work with wonky compromises, or whether we would not rather involve the entire plenary. For me, the entire House is important for legislation, and for democracy, rather than time and speed. In fact, it takes time to enact democracy and to pass laws properly.	
en.20120612.21.2-498-000.wav	Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I was also a member of the European Parliament ’ s electoral observation mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and saw for myself how the people arrived at the polling stations and waited to vote full of hopes and expectations for a better future. We now know that these expectations have not been met. Although the DRC calls itself democratic, these elections were neither fair nor democratic. We must speak out forcefully about this, as Ms Nedelcheva has done in her report. The previous president, Joseph Kabila, claimed that he was the election victor and the opposition was suppressed. In the east of the country, the violent encounters between government troops and so-called rebels have flared up again and it is unclear whether third countries such as Rwanda are involved. In every case, it is the civilian population which suffers and which has not been able to live in peace for decades. The country ’ s wealth is disappearing in a quagmire of corruption and the DRC comes at or near the bottom of the list in all the international rankings. The international community, and the European Union in particular, must take every opportunity to increase the pressure on the President of the DRC to allow genuine democracy in his country – he will have the chance to do this at the next regional elections – and to prevent the Congolese army from oppressing the civilian population. Instead, criminals who are wanted internationally for crimes against humanity, such as Bosco Ntaganda, must finally be arrested and brought before a court. Countries throughout the world should give an undertaking not to supply any more arms to the DRC. Without external pressure, it will not be possible to bring an end to human suffering and poverty in this country.	
en.20120612.5.2-043-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea behind the ‘ two-pack ’ is to provide further rights of intervention in respect of crisis countries in the euro area. The idea is to give teeth to the European Semester, which was created as a framework to provide better coordination of financial and economic policy. At the Commission ’ s behest, the Member States are to be forced to accept financial assistance. Through the ‘ six-pack ’, extensive sanction options that could be imposed on euro area countries with financial problems have already been created. The European Semester has already been perceived by the citizens more as a rollback of democracy than as a useful tool to coordinate economic policy. At the same time, the German Government is openly threatening Greek citizens with being kicked out of the euro area should they make the wrong choice in the elections on Sunday. Why do we not desist from such humiliating and undemocratic chest-beating? In a situation where the euro crisis has dramatically worsened once again – I am thinking of Spain, and of Cyprus – it in no way helps us to pillory Member States that are in crisis. We should at last produce some solutions! The rapporteurs for the ‘ two-pack ’ have developed some very sensible approaches in this regard. Ms Ferreira made reference to the debt redemption fund, which would be a worthwhile and sensible measure in order to tackle the debts. Mr Gauzès ’ s proposal for an organised process for national bankruptcy would perhaps also be an option. It is key, however, that Europe should work together and show solidarity in order to set the eurozone back on track for growth. The strong countries in Europe must desist from their self-satisfied finger pointing at their partner countries. They need to begin doing their homework, investing in growth and taking on their responsibilities. A Merkel-style policy of cuts on one side only has simply failed as a model to resolve the crisis.	
en.20120613.27.3-423-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2010, the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States finally acknowledged that the European Community needs a more closely coordinated financial and economic policy. At the summit, they ‘ invented ’ the European Semester, so to speak. It is perfectly right that members of the Economic and Monetary Union should not simply consider how their policies affect businesses, workers and consumers in their own country. A European perspective is needed. An internal market without a coordinated economic, wage and social policy may tempt Member States to create short-term growth and jobs at the expense of neighbouring countries. Such imbalances can cause monetary union to fragment, both economically and politically. That is precisely the situation currently facing the EU. The German economy has cut the ground from under its neighbours ’ feet for years. There has been no stimulus from investment and wage growth. Instead, Berlin has brought the euro area to the brink of collapse with a decade of aggressive export policy. It is therefore gratifying that the Commission is now slowly wising up to this core problem of the euro crisis in its country-specific recommendations. It is therefore right and proper that the Federal Republic is called upon to invest more in education, research and child care and that the Commission demands that it put a stop to the abuse of so-called ‘ mini jobs ’ and adapt wage growth to productivity growth. This is a belated but important insight. I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will put this demand vehemently to the German Government, even though there is no formal procedure for surplus countries.	
en.20120613.29.3-484-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission, and particularly to Commissioner Barnier, for the very simple reason that in the last legislative period, which ended in 2009, our experience was that – with the exception of a very brief moment of awakening when the proposal for the European private company came – Commissioner Barnier ’ s predecessor, Commissioner McGreevy, in fact allowed company law to be left in a deep sleep, and we made no progress at all over those five years on this important issue, which also has significance for the internal market. Thankfully, that has changed entirely. We now have a multitude of consultation documents from the European Commission, a group of experts that has debated the issue of how to develop company law further, and now we have a brand new consultation which, naturally, Parliament is looking at too. The Committee on Legal Affairs decided that we did not want to do this in the form of a report, simply because a report requires even more time and is naturally somewhat more detailed. Instead, we chose to put an oral question to the Commission, in order to be able to discuss this topic with the Commission, with Commissioner Barnier, and so that, at the same time, we can make clear Parliament ’ s position on what should happen now in a subsequent resolution. Just as was the case around ten years ago, it is necessary to develop a new action plan on European company law. This is necessary for a great many reasons. There are gaps in European company law, real gaps, which basically are resulting in the fact that the internal market has not been completed. To mention one example, there is the missing 14th directive on the transfer of company seats, which, in my opinion, is a fairly typical example of such a gap. Parliament has asked twice in legislative own-initiative reports for the European Commission to table specific proposals. There is also the committee of experts convened by the European Commission itself, which has expressed the same opinion on this. Quite simply, it is part of the basic freedoms of the internal market that a company in the internal market must be able to transfer its registered domicile. This is not possible at present, or only under extremely difficult conditions. In view of this, however, I must, at the same time, criticise the fact that the position of the European Commission to date on the topic of the 14th directive actually lags considerably behind Parliament ’ s expectations, and we are convinced that it does not meet the standard of a qualified answer to a legislative initiative either. However, we are of good courage that in the course of the continued work, when we get to the action plan, this proposal will hopefully then be reflected in the action plan. Another important point in respect of company law is the issue of how to develop company law further in order to reduce the burden on companies. Here, the Commission has already tabled very specific proposals, such as on the subject of accounting. However, there is more to do beyond this and other aspects now require clarification in the course of the consultations. We are expecting further proposals from the Commission in this area, too. I should also like to ask the Commission to revive the topic of the European private company, which, at the moment, is stuck in the Council. If there are individual Member States in the EU – and here I am expressing my own personal opinion – that are intrinsically unable, because of their own lack of decisiveness, to end the deadlock here and take Europe forward, then just as in the case of other projects – in the case of patent law or family law, for example – we must give some thought to using the instrument of enhanced cooperation, so that at least all the other Europeans will be able to enjoy this possibility. I would ask the Commission to give this issue greater consideration. Another outstanding problem is the issue of applicable law; in other words, a kind of Rome Regulation for cross-border problems in company law. I believe that this issue, too, needs further investigation and discussion, and I would ask the Commission to do this. Insolvency law is also closely related to this. In this area, however, it has been announced anyway that we will receive a specific proposal from the European Commission in the foreseeable future. As you can see, a huge amount remains to be done in the area of company law. I am grateful that Commissioner Barnier has taken the initiative here and that we can see that in the second half of this legislative period, we will receive significant proposals, which could then represent progress in the completion of the internal market. Parliament supports both the principle and the approach here. Naturally, we will have to talk about the details, and we will certainly do so. However, for the time being, I would like to give the Commission our thanks. Naturally, we would now be pleased if the Commission were actually to take up our initiatives and turn them into specific proposals.	
en.20120613.30.3-519-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, I very much like your proposal regarding the productivity-aligned wage policy. When it comes to the minimum wage, however, you have given in to Chancellor Merkel, and I do not believe you when it comes to increasing employment in health care. How are new jobs supposed to emerge there when the Commission has already forced southern and eastern Member States to reduce their hospital capacities by a half? How are jobs supposed to arise in health care when the Commission requires some Member States to reduce their expenditure on health care further in the new country-specific recommendations for the European Semester? I fear that this point in this plan is pure gesture politics, not a real initiative for new jobs. On the contrary, there is already a shortage of drugs and medicines as a result of the austerity measures, and not just in Greece. I feel that if we are constantly designing new rescue packages for the banks, then we must now work for a rescue package for people and, in particular, to secure medical supplies in the crisis countries.	
en.20120613.6.3-046-000.wav	Mr President, among many of us pro-Europeans, the mood is one of alarmed horror at what is currently happening in Europe. Nonetheless, it is pleasing that people are now speaking out much more clearly about what we are dealing with, and that we are not turning a blind eye to Italy either. Members of the Commission – and these comments are addressed to the Council, too – you know yourselves that you are stuck in a number of traps, not just as regards debt and growth, but also as regards confidence, and in the power trap. I regret to say that, so far, you have, in fact, failed to tackle the central issue, which is that the financial sector has become detached from the real economy. Whatever we have decided here, the experts constantly counter this by saying that still no serious boundaries have been imposed on the shadow banking sector, there are still systemic risks, that the issue of ‘ too big to fail ’ has still not been appropriately addressed – and we need hardly mention the ratings agencies. If you are currently preparing for the Council summit, then I can only urge and advise you to restore credibility in Europe by dealing seriously with the issue of the balance of power between the financial sector and the real economy. In plain terms, you need to be seen by Europeans to be at last working credibly to keep the banks in check, so that our citizens do not always have to bear the burden.	
en.20120613.6.3-050-000.wav	Mr Färm, you are from a country that declined to join the euro, mainly because it wished to retain the flexibility of devaluation, precisely in order to use it as a social policy instrument. In the light of current experience in Sweden, would you recommend to the Greeks that they also leave the euro area, so that they, too, can actively use devaluation as a social policy instrument?	
en.20120614.6.4-027-000.wav	Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur. This report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with an absolute majority of 62 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions. This shows that we are actually very much at one with regard to the compromises. Of course, we must give the greatest priority in this legislative process to the provision of high level consumer protection for the younger members of society, in other words children, who need special consideration. Gluten intolerance is a problem, particularly in nurseries. If we look around us – I myself have two children in this age group – we will be aware of the allergies and intolerances that arise, which is why I believe that we have chosen the right approach. We should continue to discuss this in the second reading, also involving the Council and Commission. I believe that we will then also achieve positive results.	
en.20120702.18.1-076-000.wav	Mr President, a report about a traffic accident at the weekend involving a lorry driver who fell asleep at the wheel due to exhaustion and drove into a roadside ditch has reaffirmed my view, once again, that it is absolutely necessary to have a clear and consistent regulation of driving and rest periods and their monitoring by means of a digital tachograph for us, for road safety, but also for those involved themselves. The digital tachograph involves a certain degree of innovation, it brings with it new problems, but also old ones. The new problems come in the shape of new opportunities to manipulate the device, which we need to tackle from a technical point of view. The old problems are the ones that we can already observe in various Member States in connection with inspection or a lack thereof. The new rules that we are now putting in place must pay considerable attention, in my view, to the following issues. First of all, a rest period must not automatically be commenced every time that no journey is recorded. This is because many drivers have to load and unload, and that is, of course, also to be regarded as working time. The second problem is that the records of speed have been removed from the dossier. I think that is a mistake, as here, too, there are major risks of accidents. We also want weight sensors and we want an anonymous fraud-reporting hotline that can be followed up. I will be tabling a motion for animal transport checks to be incorporated into the regulation. I think this is important, as it also has to be a key part of our legislation.	
en.20120702.24.1-209-000.wav	Madam President, many thousands of people could still have been alive today, or could have avoided permanent disabilities, had they received professional medical aid quickly enough after their accidents, specifically, within the first, or ‘ golden ’ hour. We would be a large step closer to ‘ vision zero ’. The eCall system that we are discussing today cannot prevent any accidents, nor does it provide any release from the obligation to provide first aid. It simply serves to automatically notify an emergency call control centre in the event of a serious accident. The control centre must make voice contact with the vehicle involved in an accident in order to avoid misuse and overloading with trivial incidents. Only when the emergency call is confirmed or if no one answers any more will emergency medics be sent out to the accident site, armed with little, but life-critical, information. The responsibility for the functioning of this chain of emergency service provision lies with the Member States on the basis of subsidiarity. As long as the sensors built into the vehicle do not detect an accident, the eCall system is on standby, in other words, it does not send any signals or data of any kind and is not locatable. It is therefore far from being a mobile phone from the point of view of data protection. Only if the system is woken up by the automatic sensors or conscious manual activation does it become active. It then sends an agreed, minimum set of data from the information to an emergency services control centre. Uniform Europe-wide standards and specifications will ensure that these data are recognised, assessed and handled as emergency calls on receipt. The Member States therefore need to develop and equip their chain of emergency service provision accordingly. We want this eCall emergency calling system to be based on the common EU emergency number (112), to be free for the user, to work everywhere in the EU and to be compatible with emergency call systems in neighbouring third countries. It should be based on an interoperable, technology-neutral, open system architecture. At a later date, this could also enable other intelligent public road-related services to be offered, such as real time traffic information or the availability of parking spaces. In recognition of the outstanding efforts of the motor industry to provide private emergency call systems, it is intended that these will retain their right to exist in parallel to the public, 112-based eCall system. Users can also opt for such a system based on comprehensive information. This may be accompanied by the potentially also paid-for use of the data by workshops, insurance companies, breakdown services or other service providers. Where 80% of car drivers want to see this kind of system, which is also welcomed and requested by associations and organisations for the disabled, we must not either delay it or stand in its way. I anticipate approval by the House with a large majority tomorrow.	
en.20120703.18.2-206-000.wav	Mr President, there is a German rhyme: which tells of regional pride in a brewery, and this demonstrates a problem that we have created today. If this brewery or its distributor is 107 kilometres away from where I live, then in future, it will no longer be able to supply me with its products unless it buys a new tachograph and complies with new red tape. That is why I voted against this resolution today, because in my view, we should not be overburdening our small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many points that we have managed to incorporate which were positive. After all, it was planned that a radius of just 50 kilometres should be accepted for regional suppliers. The Commission was being quite absurd there. A distance of 100 kilometres may be just about feasible. However, what if the distance is more than this? I therefore consider it to be excessive. One final aspect: as a representative of an employees ’ organisation in the German CSU party, I would also say that this regulation represents complete control of workers. Why? It is because the entire working day of those distributing construction materials or drinks from the breweries is completely controlled via GPS. For data protection reasons, too, therefore, I feel that what we have decided today is highly questionable, and I emphasise once again why I voted against it.	
en.20120703.21.2-455-000.wav	Many thanks for your question. Why am I not prepared to wait for this decision? In the Committee on Legal Affairs, I waited for the support of the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and I did not hear a word. You refused to cooperate. You simply did not want to. Now it is clear that the Court of Justice is being used as an excuse to delay matters. Why did I refer to the broad scope for interpretation? You have asked two questions, so I unfortunately have to answer both of them. I referred to this because the vague wording about the Internet service providers monitoring the Internet in the role of deputy sheriffs can be interpreted in any way you want. This means that there is legal uncertainty and this does not help our economy, Ms Jordan.	
en.20120703.21.2-464-000.wav	Mr Leichtfried, I would like to ask you a question. Are you in favour of us discussing the modernisation of copyright regulations on a European level? Or are you completely opposed to any form of intellectual property? How do you think that the e-Commerce Directive should be adapted to changing circumstances in future? From what you have said, I understand that you are totally opposed to a debate on these issues and do not support intellectual property. Is that correct?	
en.20120703.21.2-509-000.wav	Mr President, it is clear that this is not about individual facts which we have to discuss but about the fundamental issue of our attitude to democracy and civil liberties. When we look at the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), it becomes clear that it is, to a certain extent, symbolic of a lack of transparency and democracy and of the violation of fundamental rights, because it was drawn up secretly behind the scenes using an undemocratic process and because the free use of the Internet was simply no longer possible and neither was there the freedom to use generic medicines to the degree that we currently do. These are the reasons why millions of people have taken to the streets and have long since anticipated the vote on ACTA. There has already been a vote on ACTA on the streets, on the Internet and in relation to the Committee on Petitions in many countries, not only inside but also outside the EU. I believe that we must not ignore this vote. It is a demonstration of direct democracy by the many citizens who elected us. I can only say that we should put ACTA to one side. That is the only decent thing to do.	
en.20120703.4.2-035-000.wav	Mr President, Prime Minister, as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, I completed two procedures under your Presidency: the Financial Regulation – providing a set of rules for the forthcoming multiannual financial framework (MFF) period – and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) procedure. This regulation had been stuck in a queue in the Council since November 2008, and building on the results of the Polish Presidency, you took this procedure to its conclusion. I would therefore like to thank you for two really very committed financial officials who worked on these dossiers, and I would also like to thank Denmark ’ s ambassador, Mr Tranholm-Mikkelsen. I will miss you; we will miss your efficient negotiation. You have really served the financial interests of the European Union well. Thank you very much.	
en.20120704.17.3-123-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am now speaking here on behalf of my group, and I would like to express support for the motion put forward by Mr Fjellner. Ladies and gentlemen, we do not have a lot of raw materials in Europe. The raw materials that we have here are our brains and our creativity. That means that we need to deal carefully with the subject of intellectual property rights. The Commission has sent the proposal that has been put to us to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request for its opinion in order to clarify some outstanding questions. We simply need to show respect for the supreme court of the European Union and wait for this decision. There is absolutely no objective reason why we should make this decision today. No one will be prevented from voting against it once the court has submitted its decision and its opinion. When we then make our decision, however, we will be making it with a different awareness and a different insight than would be the case today. Those travelling in the wrong direction on the Internet motorway should not be the ones to decide our policies. I therefore ask you to support this motion.	
en.20120704.28.3-459-000.wav	Mr President, as always when Mr Turmes speaks, his words are very intelligent, and I wish that what he said had much more influence on European policy. I just wanted to follow on from what he said. Of course, these project bonds are sensible, but only if they are set up in a sustainable way and if we establish a political basis to support them. By providing guarantees, we run the risk of providing cover for risks that we have no political control over. Specific examples include the switch to sustainable energy in Germany: a 3 800 kilometre network would be necessary, but only 100 kilometres of the corresponding transmission networks have been built, as this is also being thwarted by resistance from citizens – and, incidentally, very environmentally minded citizens. We need to think of a political solution to this. One idea might be for us to establish shared trans-European network corridors, not just combining the high-speed routes for railways and broadband networks, but also perhaps constructing the relevant distribution networks above or even alongside motorways. That does require much more extensive planning than has been carried out up to now, but I would at least like to take this opportunity to put it forward as a suggestion.	
en.20120704.29.3-514-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Schengen is one of the greatest achievements in the European Union, however I am also aware that our Member States are sensitive of their borders and are likely to remain so. I am aware that the problems that exist between the Member States in relation to Schengen cannot simply be ignored. These problems are many and varied. Ignoring these problems does not make them any better or easier to resolve. I live near the border with the Czech Republic and no one on our side would ever dream of simply closing the border again when problems are encountered. I would also call on the Commission to offer support in this area, rather than restrictions and rebukes. Dragnet controls were incorporated because we wish to ensure security while still allowing freedom to travel. If we are to be successful in implementing dragnet controls at locations that are frequent crossing points for drug dealers, such as the Czech border in particular, then I believe it is best for the German and Czech interior ministers to sit down together to find a joint solution to the problems that exist at the border. The Commission should not adopt a regulatory role here, but rather a positive supporting role. We wish to rein in the populists, but also to resolve the real problems in a concerted approach. That is why I am also calling on the Council to seek a solution together with Parliament, so that we can successfully conclude the Schengen dossier, upholding freedom to travel while also ensuring the security of our citizens.	
en.20120704.29.3-518-000.wav	Mr President, the cases of disproportionate border checks listed by Parliament in its question also show why the Council is seeking to exclude Parliament with regard to Schengen. The fact is that the Council wants to continue to undermine freedom to travel without involving Parliament in the decision-making process, without any form of parliamentary control or public debate. It is hardly surprising, then, that it would prefer to avoid awkward questions and withdraw to backrooms where its members can pat themselves on the back. We should not be surprised that the German Government wants to prevent an evaluation of the internal borders and is unwilling to consider just how much freedom to travel is restricted. However, Schengen does not belong to the governments, but rather to the people of Europe and therefore it also belongs in the European Parliament.	
en.20120704.3.3-017-000.wav	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Christofias, for me and my group, welcoming you here in your role as the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union represents a very special moment. We are very pleased that for the first time in the history of the European Union a member of our political family is leading the EU. You are taking over the presidency at a time when the European Union is faced with huge challenges. We need to determine whether the European Union will actually have a future or whether it will turn out to be footnote in history, which I would regard as a historic defeat. After the meetings which we had with you, with the representatives of your government and with the leaders of the groups and parties in your country, I know that you have made very thorough preparations for the presidency and that you are aware of the scope of the task. However, you have made it clear today that you specifically want to focus the attention of those in power on the living conditions of the people. I can tell you after everything I have heard in recent years that this is the first time that a President-in-Office of the European Union has said that he will do precisely that. I have not heard this sort of tone in official speeches before. I have not heard anyone say that this is all about the people, about the ones who are not responsible for the crisis, but have the heaviest burdens to bear. It will be difficult to put this into practice. However, I believe that you will have achieved a great deal, and I am certain that you will do this, if you can use your presidency to give encouragement to the people, to support their rights and to help to ensure that the Council and the European institutions are aware of what you are doing. We are constantly talking about the euro and its stability, about how important the euro is for the functioning of the European Union and for the euro area. However, it is an instrument. It is based on political conditions that have been clearly defined. It can never be the objective of the European Union to accept that people in the EU will go hungry, that health care systems will collapse or that local authorities will stop working in order for the euro to continue functioning. Something has gone wrong here. That is not what we see as the objective of the European Union. I very much support your call for social cohesion and solidarity between the individual Member States, but also between all the very different groups of people. The European Union cannot allow itself to be used as an instrument or a speaker for a particular small section of the population or present itself in that way. I would like to make one final point to emphasise, of course, that all of the priorities you have mentioned are very important to us and that we will support the points which take us in the direction you have just defined. Please help to ensure that people are no longer afraid. Fear is the worst guide for democracies. I think that many of the decisions made in recent weeks and months, in particular during the elections in Greece and the referendum in Ireland, were characterised by fear. If those in power in the European Union are contributing to the fact that people are afraid to make free decisions, this does not bode well for the future of the European Union. I wish you every success in what you have to do.	
en.20120912.22.3-368-000.wav	. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as co-rapporteurs we have an extremely important role here too. It will be very important to my colleague that work should progress quickly and reliably on this file in the coming weeks and months. All eyes are on us and the Council in this regard, waiting for us to overcome the crisis with the banks in Europe with a further step towards Europeanisation, namely a European banking union. It should be pointed out that Parliament demanded this with a broad majority two years ago. We held 26 trialogues. We made some progress in this direction, but unfortunately we did not get as far as we really needed to. This resulted in several billions more being added to the bill. It is good that the Council has now seen the writing on the wall and wishes to take things one step further for the good of the euro area. It is praiseworthy that the Commission has drawn up the proposals so quickly. There are some difficulties with the Council ’ s proposal that the European Central Bank (ECB) should become the euro area watchdog, however. This results in unanimity in the Council, and means that Parliament is no longer involved in this matter in the codecision procedure. In the light of our experience with the supervisory package, this is not acceptable. That is why it is important that we should work quickly and that we should also negotiate this proposal regarding changes in the ECB as a package with the necessary changes in the existing supervisory regime, thereby securing the principle of the democratic involvement of Parliament on a de facto basis. Other challenges also exist on a democratic level. The ECB is independent in terms of monetary policy, but not in terms of fiscal policy, for which it has had no responsibility until now. If it is now made responsible for bank supervision, Parliament needs full budgetary rights, control rights, questioning rights and appointment rights, and I am certain that Parliament will support this with a broad majority. We shall have to discuss the complex additional questions relating to the internal market, consumer protection and the balance between European power and financial responsibility in detail in the coming weeks.	
en.20120912.23.3-426-000.wav	. Mr President, by proposing to shut out developing countries from preferential market access, the Commission is attempting to coerce these countries into free trade agreements. These free trade agreements are not partnerships, as the term economic partnerships would suggest, but rather are only concerned with the interests of the EU and not the developmental interests of the partner countries. This runs completely contrary to the EU ’ s objective of reducing poverty and organising all external political instruments in line with this principle. Countries like Cameroon, Ivory Cost and Namibia would be very hard hit by this restriction. Regional integration projects, such as those in South East Africa, would collapse if Kenya were to consent to such an agreement. South-south cooperation would be at an end. We cannot broadcast the message of free trade to the world with the simple intention that other countries should please buy our products. If the Commission really believes that trade can promote development, then it should stop blocking it. The Committee on Development in the House has recommended that the Commission ’ s proposal should be rejected. We should follow suit in plenary.	
en.20120912.28.3-540-000.wav	. Mr President, there are enormous human rights problems in Central America, as well as in Peru and Colombia. As Members of the European Parliament, we cannot simply close our eyes to this fact. We intend examining the road map for human rights demanded by Parliament in the case of Columbia and Peru once it has been drawn up. This must have substance and be binding and must cover initial results, such as the prosecution of criminals and the safe return of exiles to their country of origin. Naturally, this road map must be in place before we vote on the agreement. We, the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, believe it is right that the Committee on International Trade should call for environmental and social standards in the proposed regulation for the safeguard clauses, rather than just tonnage restrictions for bananas. This must be confirmed by the trialogue, as otherwise the regulation is worthless. The EU needs to do a lot more to keep a close eye on the situation at local level and, above all, the impact on the local population. That is why the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is also calling for a proper impact assessment prior to all negotiations, examining not only the economic impact on the EU, but also the impact on human rights.	
en.20120912.4.3-090-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have already made it clear in the first round of speeches what I would like the focus of our attention to be. My group expects the Commission to fulfil its responsibilities in the relevant bodies such as the troika, in order to make it entirely clear that the Commission as a European institution wants to ensure that people are no longer pushed into poverty, that working hours are not increased and that environmental and social standards are not ignored. That is your job. If we succeed in making that clear, then we will be sending out a signal to the people who in recent days have gone out onto the streets in their thousands and hundreds of thousands to protest. Our group is in solidarity with these people, whether they are in Thessaloniki or Barcelona. I heard this morning on the news that cancer patients are protesting in Greece. How bad has the situation become when people who are in the midst of a serious social and personal crisis are not receiving any more help and support, because the health system has collapsed? We finally need to take action in this area. Many people in positions of responsibility believe that people in Greece and in other states have been living beyond their means. They must now be punished for this and have sanctions imposed on them. This is not an appropriate way of strengthening the European community, which is based on solidarity. I am not implying that you are one of these people, Mr Barroso, but this is a theme which is being constantly repeated in the media in many countries and, unfortunately, also in mine.	
en.20120913.29.4-150-000.wav	Mr President, I must admit, I have made a mistake. I wish to give an explanation of vote not in respect of this report, but in respect of the Moreira report on the agreement concerning immediate autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan. Can I please ask you to give me the floor again at the appropriate time?	
en.20120913.7.4-027-000.wav	Madam President, the new directive will provide a basis for dealing with books, newspapers, works of art, films, pieces of music and television productions that are protected by copyright, but for which the rights holder cannot be identified or cannot be located. Under the directive, books, films, photographs or other intellectual creations for which no rights holder can be found are to be made available to the public. This will create a cultural treasure trove. For us in the Committee on Culture and Education, it was of very particular importance to emphasise the special importance of the diversity of the cultural heritage of the European Union in this legislative initiative. In the archives of our museums, libraries, publishing houses and broadcasters, countless unused works are to be found which, until now, were not made available purely because the rights holders were unknown. This directive will change that. It will make it possible for these cultural assets to be used in future, provided that it is ensured that a diligent search is carried out before publication. This is a very important point, as it prevents people from breezily declaring that the rights holder just cannot be found. There is a need, after all, to find a balance between the real, existing rights of the creators of works and the public ’ s need to be able to use works where the rights situation cannot be resolved. For us, there is a particular focus on the need to ensure that both known and unknown rights holders must continue to be fully protected. Where rights holders cannot be found, the proposals make it possible to make use of the digitisation of the orphan works. Projects such as Europeana, and other major European digitisation projects, but also our museums, archives, educational institutions and public broadcasters, will benefit from this arrangement. In future, however, orphan works in the archives of private publishers must also be made available to the public. In my view, this draft directive and the compromise that has now been reached really represent a compromise and a first step in the right direction. I believe that the cultural treasure trove that is up for grabs holds an enormous potential. We should continue to work on that when we revise the directive in two years ’ time.	
en.20121022.19.1-065-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, President of the Council, I would be glad if we could also find clear signals from the Council in the proposal for 2013 that show how we in Europe can enhance the potential for growth and competitiveness and, above all, how we can give young people jobs again. Could it please inform us under which budget lines it intends to promote youth employment and entrepreneurialism and focus on small and medium-sized enterprises? We know that a target programme is the basic precondition for this – all I see here is cuts by the Council. The same applies to the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs and to the media pluralism programme: there are only cuts here. Does it think the way to overcome the crisis in Europe is to make cuts in the very areas that guarantee growth and employment? I heard that the Council was going to put forward growth and employment packages. Where do we find them in the budget the Council has presented?	
en.20121022.22.1-168-000.wav	Mr President, last Wednesday, the Nordseewerke shipyard in Emden had to file for bankruptcy because, to its surprise, a guarantee by the Lower Saxon Land Government was not extended. That undertaking, with 700 skilled jobs, is in the process of transforming from a shipyard to a supplier of offshore wind energy. And it is now thought that this undertaking can be saved by a large loan and that the jobs can also be saved, for the 700 SIAG and Nordseewerke workers have already had to accept substantial cuts in their pay. That is why I ask the Commission to take a favourable and also an early look at this procedure, to ensure that these 700 jobs are not put at risk, because they are needed in order to organise the energy revolution and sustainable energy on the seas of Europe. Please do not let the workers there suffer from the Land government ’ s poor crisis management.	
en.20121023.18.2-333-000.wav	Mr President, dual-use items often look harmless, but in the hands of authoritarian regimes they can be as lethal as machine guns or tanks. We undermine our foreign policy goals if we send surveillance technologies to authoritarian regimes which can then use them to monitor and suppress democracy movements. It was European mobile phone software produced by Nokia Siemens Networks which played into the hands of the Iranian security forces as they crushed the Green protest movement. Large numbers of protesters were abducted, imprisoned, tortured and sentenced to death. That is just one of many examples. Furthermore, with its Action Plan for an innovative and competitive security industry, as it is called, the Commission is promoting these dubious dual-purpose items. Its stated aim is better exploitation of synergies between security and defence technologies. We are on the verge of selling out: selling out, quite literally, not only human rights but also our security interests in favour of an industrial policy of dubious worth. For that reason, I urge you to vote for the amendments tabled by our Group together with the Social Democrats and the ALDE.	
en.20121025.11.4-022-000.wav	Mr President, I would like to ask Ms Regner: in your view, what could trade unions do to combat youth unemployment, for example in Spain and Portugal? Demonstrations will not be enough. What active policy could the single market implement in this respect?	
en.20121025.28.4-353-000.wav	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, through today ’ s debate on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments, we have advanced into the core area for financial market regulation within this legislative period; now we need to regulate the financial markets and not just look at individual products, as we did in the past. I just want to pick out a few key terms. In the last year we have not made life easy for ourselves. We have conducted a hearing in committee, we have surveyed all the stakeholders and every interested group, and on this basis, through various processes, working documents and the like, produced a result which we are setting before this plenary session here today and tomorrow. I will take a few points from it. Firstly, market structure. On the one hand, we must concede that in recent years something has happened in the financial markets which has made it in Parliament ’ s interest that each trade in securities takes place under the MiFID rules, which is why we have approved a new category – bounded by many conditions – called Organised Trading Facilities, where only non-equities can be traded, where proprietary trading is forbidden and where, with regard to execution, transaction and customer interaction, execution may take place at the operator ’ s discretion. Through this process I think that we are making an important contribution to ensuring that the entire area of traded OTC papers is handled within the MiFID environment. Another major subject not considered in the last MiFID is algorithmic or high-frequency trading. Once again, we needed to issue clear rules here, so that these areas, which can be very dangerous and can be manipulatively employed, is subject to a strict system with minimum holding periods, trade interruption opportunities, the option to test algorithms, the option of examining algorithms within the supervisory structure, the introduction of tick-size regimes, a minimum price, and corresponding fee systems. Another subject I would like to touch on is the area of commodities futures markets. I do believe that we have a particular responsibility here, when it comes to restricting the speculative part of commodities futures markets, not to contribute through bad regulation to a situation where people in the third and fourth worlds can no longer buy food. Because of this, we have chosen a two-pronged approach with the aim of curbing speculation but not thereby damaging the real economy. We want to achieve this by using position limits with strict ceilings on the number of contracts or positions. We also want to ensure, by means of the position-check system, that those who can prove that they really need a product do not suddenly speculate in this market. Another issue that concerns us is the area of investor protection. I would like to point out here that we have chosen a very broad approach in guaranteeing protection for consumers and investors. This means that the requirements of specific customer groups need to be identified. Not every small saver needs access to highly complex papers. What is needed is to define the relevant products for target groups, carry out product testing, make telephone recordings, give relevant advice, disclosure requirements, but – I want to briefly mention – to proceed, with regard to commissions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Member States should be able, according to their structures, to make relevant accommodations. I think we are on the right track here. My time is running out, so I thank everyone who has been involved. I think it is a shame that we only have four minutes ’ speaking time for such a complex report. I thank all my colleagues who collaborated on this and the Commission for the very constructive role it has played in recent weeks and months. I hope that a strong vote in the plenary session tomorrow will put us in a situation to negotiate with the Council in order to resolve this important report as soon as possible.	
en.20121025.28.4-361-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you for the generally good collaboration on this report. We have a Commission proposal that has already made great strides in the right direction but could be further improved in key areas. In the area of market structures there will be more transparency and there will be greater transparency as part of the MiFID in the area of derivatives trading. The resolutions of our compromise in the area of high-frequency trading go much further than what the Commission originally proposed and deserve the support of Parliament in their entirety. The report is moving in the right direction, even in areas that have attracted major public criticism. In the area of commodities and food speculation the report – after, it must be said, many difficult debates – is much stronger than the Commission ’ s resolutions, since position limits are now established as binding. However, we need further amendments in this area in order to close some gaps. I am hoping for additions through the plenary vote and also in the trialogue. It is pleasing that Mr Barnier has signalled his support of Parliament ’ s detailed proposal. However, the report does have weaknesses in the area of consumer protection. That we are now able to ban products is a sign of progress, but we have still made no changes in the area of commission-based advice. The marketing of financial products is still not orientated primarily towards the interests of consumers but dominated by products with the highest commissions. Consumers have lost a lot of money in Germany and everywhere else in the EU. Take open-ended property funds, for example. For citizens in, say, France, Italy, Spain and Germany, our compromise will unfortunately not change very much. The basic principle will remain the orientation of products around commissions. Referring to subsidiarity here is a bit simplistic. I would have liked to see stronger rules here.	
en.20121119.27.1-235-000.wav	. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I can only say that patience is its own reward. The report on type approval for Category L vehicles has turned out well in the end. The work took longer, overall, than we all thought it would – certainly longer than we hoped it would – and there were a lot more pitfalls along the way than we would have liked. However, I would like, at this point, to thank the rapporteur, Mr van de Camp, most warmly for his excellent cooperation. Together we achieved a lot in our talks with the Member States. As rapporteur for my group, I commend this report to the House – even though it could have been better. By better I mean safer. For us Social Democrats, the emphasis right from the start was on the safety of vehicles and thus the safety of their drivers, above all those driving scooters and motorcycles. The figures for motorcycle accidents have remained constant for years. Basically the number of fatal accidents is declining in Europe – apart from those involving motorcycles. Cutting the number of motorcycle and scooter fatalities is something I feel passionate about. Fewer deaths on Europe ’ s roads was and is my goal. Each death is one death too many. In a regulation that brings so much benefit to the internal market, this issue must be addressed with vigour. I remain convinced that this can be achieved through effective anti-lock braking systems (ABS). I am equally convinced that they are cost-effective. It just is not true that ABS is too expensive. Anyway, we have secured a mandatory requirement that manufacturers must, as of 2016, fit all new motorcycles of 125 cc and over, and from 2017 all existing motorcycles of that capacity, with ABS. Motor scooters may be fitted, at the choice of the vehicle manufacturer, with ABS or a combined brake system. In this respect, it must be said, unfortunately, that we have not managed to improve on the Commission ’ s proposal. I would have liked to have achieved a lot more here, but the Commission and Member States were – I choose my words carefully – very slow to move forward on the whole business. However, we secured the promise of a Commission report in 2019. The report is to include road accident figures from the Member States and will consider the mandatory fitting of ABS to motor scooters. It will be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. On the basis of the report, the Commission will then decide whether or not to make the fitting of ABS to motor scooters mandatory. As you can see, this remains very much a work in progress. Thus we shall seek to close the loophole in the law in 2019. I am sure the figures we receive will vindicate me. I am convinced that this is indeed a good day for two-wheeler riders in Europe, and that we shall see a drop in the accident figures in future.	
en.20121120.31.2-533-000.wav	Mr President, Mr Groote, there is no technology without risks! The perfect energy generation technology does not exist. I believe the same applies to what we are discussing here today. I am very much in favour of a rational discussion. What we are currently experiencing is a new arrival on the energy markets in the form of unconventional resources, applying mainly to gas, but also to oil. It is neither appropriate to get carried away with euphoria about the great future of gas, nor, as some of my colleagues from the Greens and Left have done here, to paint a picture of terrifying scenarios which bear absolutely no resemblance to reality. I think we should bear in mind that these unconventional resources have the potential to change all the familiar energy supply relationships between suppliers and consumers, and that economic efficiency calculations for existing energy sources are also called into question. We should face up to this development. We should acknowledge that it could also be an opportunity for Europe and not only a risk, and we should prepare ourselves to take up and use new technologies in a positive way, to weigh up opportunities and risks fairly and not to fall into ideological debates.	
en.20121120.37.2-726-000.wav	. − Mr President, Commissioner, I was not entirely satisfied by your answer. I consider it a very long period of time if it is possible for a year to pass between notification that a complaint has been received and the issuing of a response. In my view a complainant who makes this effort – and in most cases he will already have been through the entire legal process in his own Member State – deserves more. We are reliant on citizens who are committed to the European Union. If they demonstrate their commitment in this form, we should treat them accordingly. I believe it is necessary and absolutely essential in the long term that we have a procedure here that is clearly formalised and clearly regulates rights, by which I mean an explanation of how the Commission intends to handle this. With regard to another point: I have nothing against it, should this prove helpful, if an attempt is made together with the Member State to bring about a kind of mutual resolution. That will not always be sufficient, however. We can see that things move relatively quickly in economic matters, for example, when a company institutes proceedings against another due to an infringement of EU law. If, however, the matter relates, for example, to environmental or similar concerns, an area in which a large number of citizens are calling for action by the European Union, or social rights, the proceedings are somewhat slower. I believe that these facts must also be given careful consideration. For my next report I would like us to have clearly formalised the rights of the complainant in relation to the Commission, for these to be really clear and also to be really well communicated. If we really want European law to be applied, after we have decided on it together, following a whole host of procedures in the European Parliament and Council, we must provide information as efficiently and precisely as possible to people who care about such things, who really get involved in European issues. This is a matter of great concern to me. Next time I will look carefully once again to see what developments have been made in this area.	
en.20121121.29.3-487-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU Strategy for Central Asia came into being five years ago. If we look at the state of implementation of this Strategy today, the outcomes are ambivalent. We see Member States, on an individual basis, endeavouring to cultivate good economic links, particularly with the resource-rich countries in this region, but we also see that the efforts to support these countries ’ transition to modern, democratic societies are not progressing, or – as recent events in Kazakhstan show – are marred by setbacks. Despite, or perhaps because of this, the European Union and its Member States must make more intensive efforts to exert influence jointly in the region, particularly in relation to Kazakhstan, which is now one of the main suppliers of oil to numerous EU countries. Any attempt by the EU to isolate Kazakhstan will simply allow the EU ’ s competitors for influence in this geopolitically strategic country, who attach less importance to urging respect for human and civil rights, to wield even greater influence than before. Linkage between economic interests and respect for civil rights is at the heart of the EU Strategy for Central Asia. This should also be the basis for further negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan. The present report offers a good framework for this process.	
en.20121121.30.3-514-000.wav	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, absent representatives of the Council, perhaps you are following the debate on the European Parliament ’ s videostream, as you clearly have neither the capacity nor the inclination to speak to us live. In my view, the Council ’ s absence from this debate today shows total disrespect for Parliament. Instead of shying away from this debate, they should explain why they are intent on refusing to make any improvement in the protection of personal data in the police and judicial spheres by means of a directive. We know that the police and judiciary have been an El Dorado for violations of data protection for years, and not only in relation to SWIFT. Violation has now become routine; for example, the personal data of citizens who participate in anti-Nazi demonstrations are unlawfully collected and stored. We need the same standards of protection in the public and the private sphere and in relation to the police and judiciary. This is essential in order to protect civil rights. The Council expects this House to collaborate constructively on regulations of relevance to data protection, such as EU-PNA, but we expect the same of the Council. I therefore urge the Council to stop stalling on data protection at last!
